    "query": "What is the history and cultural significance behind the traditional dance form, Flamenco, and how has it evolved over time to become a globally recognized art form?",
    "response": "Flamenco is a form of song, dance, and instrumental music that originated in southern Spain, especially in the region of Andalusia, and is strongly influenced by the Roma people (also known as Gitanos or Gypsies) who migrated from India to Spain between the 9th and 14th centuries[^1^] [^3^]. Flamenco also incorporates elements of the cultures of the Sephardic Jews and the Moors who lived in Spain for centuries[^1^]. Flamenco is characterized by profound emotion, complex rhythms, expressive gestures, and intricate guitar playing[^1^].\n\nFlamenco has evolved over time to become a globally recognized art form that has been declared as part of the World's Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO[^2^]. Flamenco has also been influenced by musical traditions from the Caribbean, Latin America, and Europe[^2^]. Flamenco has three main categories: cante jondo (deep song), cante intermedio (intermediate song), and cante chico (light song)[^1^]. Each category has different styles, themes, and structures. Flamenco also involves other elements such as poetry, hand-clapping, finger snapping, and call and response[^2^].\n\nFlamenco has had a complicated history and cultural significance in Spain. For a long time, flamenco was considered a vulgar and pornographic spectacle by many Spaniards who saw it as a hindrance to Spain's modernization and progress[^2^]. Flamenco was also associated with the marginalization and oppression of the Roma people who faced discrimination and persecution in Spain[^3^]. However, flamenco also became popular among foreign tourists and artists who admired its passion and beauty[^2^]. Flamenco gradually gained recognition and respect as a symbol of Spanish national identity and cultural diversity[^4^].",

              "Their centuries-long cultural intermingling produced the unique art form known as flamenco.",
              "The essence of flamenco is cante, or song.",
              "Flamenco songs fall into three categories: cante jondo (\u201cprofound song,\u201d or \u201cdeep song\u201d), cante intermedio (\u201cintermediate song,\u201d also called cante flamenco), and cante chico (\u201clight song\u201d).",
              "The cante jondo, whose structure usually is based on a complex 12-beat rhythm, is thought to be the oldest form.",
              "It is characterized by profound emotion and deals with themes of death, anguish, despair, or religious doubt.",
              "The cante intermedio is a hybrid form that incorporates elements of Spanish music styles, especially the fandango.",
              "The cante chico, which is generally simpler in rhythm than the other two forms, also requires considerable technical skill but much less emotional investment, dealing as it usually does with humour and subjects of love, the countryside, and gaiety.",
              "Each song style is distinguished by a characteristic rhythm and chord structure;",
              "yet several types of cante may share the same rhythm but individualize accentuation, subtleties, and emotional content.",
              "The ancestry of many types of song is traceable.",
              "Thus, the serious soleares, a descendant of the much older can\u0303as, gave rise to the light alegri\u0301as, from which developed other light-song types, such as the buleri\u0301as.",
              "The alborea\u0301s is traditionally sung only at weddings and is considered unlucky on other occasions.",
              "Other forms, such as the fandangos grandes, were adopted from Spanish folk song and dance, the fandangos becoming more serious in character than the original and begetting a series of descendants that includes the malaguen\u0303as and the Arab-influenced cartageneras.",
              "Latin American influence appears in later genres such as the rumbas gitanas and the colombianas.",
              "Most deeply associated with Gitano flamenco tradition are the cantes grandes, such as the siguiriyas gitanas;",
              "the saetas, adopted from Spanish religious processions;",
              "and the martinetes, an early song type created in the environment of the forge, in which the beat of the hammer against the anvil reflects the pain and sense of persecution felt by the perpetual outsider.",
              "After the mid-19th century, flamenco song was usually accompanied by guitar music and a palo seco (Spanish: \u201cdry stick,\u201d a stick that was beat on the floor to keep time) and a dancer performing a series of choreographed dance steps and improvised styles.",
              "Baile, or dance, has been the dominant element of flamenco since that time, though it is never performed without accompaniment.",
              "As an accompanist to the dancer (bailaor [male], bailaora [female]), the singer (cantaor) relates the legends and stories of daily life that reflect the experiences of an outcast subculture within predominately white, Christian Spain.",
              "The dancer is the protagonist of the singer\u2019s narrative and its interpreter.",
              "The baile is a sensuous display of fluid motion, stylized and yet highly personal, involving movement of the arms (braceo) and upper torso, hand and finger movement (florea), footwork (zapateado), and heelwork (taconeo), which are often displayed in long solo passages (solea).",
              "Male dancers usually perform intricate footwork, whereas female dancers, traditionally wearing elaborately ruffled dresses, emphasize the hands and upper torso.",
              "The guitarist (tocoar) keeps the rhythm (compa\u0301s) necessary to the dancer\u2019s individual rhythmic cadences, accompanying (and, when the performance space is large, even following) the dancer.",
              "A deeply musical dancer, after a 15- or 20-minute sequence, is said to fall into a duende, an intensely focused, trancelike state of transcendent emotion that Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca in 1933 described as los sonidos negros (\u201cthe dark sounds\u201d) invading the performer\u2019s body.",
              "This extraordinary state is enhanced by rhythmic hand clapping and encouraging interjections (jaleo) from the audience and fellow performers.",
              "Gitano flamenco performers regard the cante jondo as a form of prayer, and thus, in duende, the dancer communicates with both the audience and God.",
              "What may well reveal the ancient origins of flamenco are the gestures of the profound dance (baile grande), in which the arm, hand, and foot movements closely resemble those of classical Hindu dance of the Indian subcontinent.",
              "The golden age of flamenco is usually considered to be the period between roughly 1780 and 1845.",
              "Singing was then the primary aspect of flamenco, dancing and musical accompaniment being secondary.",
              "What had been an essentially outdoor, outsider, family-oriented activity that focused on cante was transformed beginning in 1842, when Silverio Franconetti founded the first cafe\u0301 cantante, Cafe\u0301 sin Nombre, in Sevilla (Seville).",
              "That establishment and the many others that sprang up in the major urban centres of Spain\u2014notably Granada, Co\u0301rdoba, and Sevilla\u2014placed emphasis on the musicians and dancers, and it was in this period that the singer began to take a secondary role.",
              "Although these commercial interests afforded a living for many performers for the first time, they also brought about what many considered a bastardization of an authentic indigenous art form.",
              "Several intellectuals, including Lorca and composer Manuel de Falla, sought to restore the purity of flamenco, and in 1922 they instituted the first flamenco competition\u2014calling for cante primitivo andaluz (\u201cprimitive Andalusian cante\u201d).",
              "This timely attempt to prevent the further debasement of an authentic folk art effectively promoted flamenco to a sophisticated urban public and helped to further the thoughtful development of the art within a modern context.",
              "Among the many great early 20th-century performers are La Argentina (Antonia Merce\u0301), Vicente Escudero, Carmen Amaya, La Argentinita (Encarnacio\u0301n Lo\u0301pez), Jose\u0301 Greco, and Pilar Lo\u0301pez, as well as the troupes of Antonio and Rosario (Antonio Ruiz Soler and Rosario Florencia Pe\u0301rez Podilla) and Xime\u0301nez-Vargas (Roberto Xime\u0301nez and Manolo Vargas).",
              "Classically influenced flamenco artists Antonio Gades, Christina Hoyos, Jose\u0301 Greco II, and Lola Greco have also pushed the boundaries of flamenco.",
              "Gades in particular, in his collaborations with the filmmaker Carlos Saura, introduced flamenco to an international audience, demonstrating through his ingenious choreographic direction the dimensions of flamenco as an expandable performance art.",
              "Contemporary artists such as Eva la Yerbabuena, Joaqui\u0301n Corte\u0301s, Antonio Canales, Bele\u0301n Maya, and Juana Amaya are creating new rhythmic strategies in the studio and integrating them into longer narrative theatre pieces in which rhythm becomes the dominant element of the dance.",
              "In the last few decades of the 20th century, flamenco also was influenced by the general musical trend toward fusion of styles."

              "Latin American influence appears in later genres such as the rumbas gitanas and the colombianas.",
              "Most deeply associated with Gitano flamenco tradition are the cantes grandes, such as the siguiriyas gitanas;",
              "the saetas, adopted from Spanish religious processions;",
              "and the martinetes, an early song type created in the environment of the forge, in which the beat of the hammer against the anvil reflects the pain and sense of persecution felt by the perpetual outsider.",
              "After the mid-19th century, flamenco song was usually accompanied by guitar music and a palo seco (Spanish: \u201cdry stick,\u201d a stick that was beat on the floor to keep time) and a dancer performing a series of choreographed dance steps and improvised styles.",
              "Baile, or dance, has been the dominant element of flamenco since that time, though it is never performed without accompaniment.",
              "As an accompanist to the dancer (bailaor [male], bailaora [female]), the singer (cantaor) relates the legends and stories of daily life that reflect the experiences of an outcast subculture within predominately white, Christian Spain.",
              "The dancer is the protagonist of the singer\u2019s narrative and its interpreter.",
              "The baile is a sensuous display of fluid motion, stylized and yet highly personal, involving movement of the arms (braceo) and upper torso, hand and finger movement (florea), footwork (zapateado), and heelwork (taconeo), which are often displayed in long solo passages (solea).",
              "Male dancers usually perform intricate footwork, whereas female dancers, traditionally wearing elaborately ruffled dresses, emphasize the hands and upper torso.",
              "The guitarist (tocoar) keeps the rhythm (compa\u0301s) necessary to the dancer\u2019s individual rhythmic cadences, accompanying (and, when the performance space is large, even following) the dancer.",
              "A deeply musical dancer, after a 15- or 20-minute sequence, is said to fall into a duende, an intensely focused, trancelike state of transcendent emotion that Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca in 1933 described as los sonidos negros (\u201cthe dark sounds\u201d) invading the performer\u2019s body.",
              "This extraordinary state is enhanced by rhythmic hand clapping and encouraging interjections (jaleo) from the audience and fellow performers.",
              "Gitano flamenco performers regard the cante jondo as a form of prayer, and thus, in duende, the dancer communicates with both the audience and God.",
              "What may well reveal the ancient origins of flamenco are the gestures of the profound dance (baile grande), in which the arm, hand, and foot movements closely resemble those of classical Hindu dance of the Indian subcontinent.",
              "The golden age of flamenco is usually considered to be the period between roughly 1780 and 1845.",
              "Singing was then the primary aspect of flamenco, dancing and musical accompaniment being secondary.",
              "What had been an essentially outdoor, outsider, family-oriented activity that focused on cante was transformed beginning in 1842, when Silverio Franconetti founded the first cafe\u0301 cantante, Cafe\u0301 sin Nombre, in Sevilla (Seville).",
              "That establishment and the many others that sprang up in the major urban centres of Spain\u2014notably Granada, Co\u0301rdoba, and Sevilla\u2014placed emphasis on the musicians and dancers, and it was in this period that the singer began to take a secondary role.",
              "Although these commercial interests afforded a living for many performers for the first time, they also brought about what many considered a bastardization of an authentic indigenous art form.",
              "Several intellectuals, including Lorca and composer Manuel de Falla, sought to restore the purity of flamenco, and in 1922 they instituted the first flamenco competition\u2014calling for cante primitivo andaluz (\u201cprimitive Andalusian cante\u201d).",
              "This timely attempt to prevent the further debasement of an authentic folk art effectively promoted flamenco to a sophisticated urban public and helped to further the thoughtful development of the art within a modern context.",
              "Among the many great early 20th-century performers are La Argentina (Antonia Merce\u0301), Vicente Escudero, Carmen Amaya, La Argentinita (Encarnacio\u0301n Lo\u0301pez), Jose\u0301 Greco, and Pilar Lo\u0301pez, as well as the troupes of Antonio and Rosario (Antonio Ruiz Soler and Rosario Florencia Pe\u0301rez Podilla) and Xime\u0301nez-Vargas (Roberto Xime\u0301nez and Manolo Vargas).",
              "Classically influenced flamenco artists Antonio Gades, Christina Hoyos, Jose\u0301 Greco II, and Lola Greco have also pushed the boundaries of flamenco.",
              "Gades in particular, in his collaborations with the filmmaker Carlos Saura, introduced flamenco to an international audience, demonstrating through his ingenious choreographic direction the dimensions of flamenco as an expandable performance art.",
              "Contemporary artists such as Eva la Yerbabuena, Joaqui\u0301n Corte\u0301s, Antonio Canales, Bele\u0301n Maya, and Juana Amaya are creating new rhythmic strategies in the studio and integrating them into longer narrative theatre pieces in which rhythm becomes the dominant element of the dance.",
              "In the last few decades of the 20th century, flamenco also was influenced by the general musical trend toward fusion of styles."

              "\u00a9 Ronald Lee, 2003, all rights reserved Much has been written about Flamenco music and what contribution the Roma have made to its development and continuity.",
              "In the past, many authorities whose knowledge of Romani history and that of Spain was peripheral have stated that Flamenco is a mixture of various elements, Spanish, Moorish, Jewish and Romani and that Flamenco evolved through a mixing of these musical traditions over a long period of time.",
              "When examined in the light of recorded history, this theory seems to be total mythology as far as the Roma are concerned.",
              "To begin with, the Roma (1) only arrived in Andalusia towards the end of the Moorish period.",
              "The first documented record of the appearance of Roma in Spain is a passage of safe conduct issued by Alphonso V of Arago\u0301n in 1425 in the city of Zaragoza to a certain Toma\u0301s, Count of Little Egypt.",
              "The often expounded theory that the Roma reached Spain by way of North Africa is popular mythology that can easily be refuted by the large number of Slavic loan words to be found in the Calo\u0301 dialect of Romani such as pusca (firearm), beringa (chain), olicha (street) and silno (strong).",
              "These and many more Slavic loan words, plus Greek and Rumanian borrowings are the same as in other European-Romani dialects and prove that the Cale\u0301s of Spain reached Spain by the same route as the European Roma reached the rest of central, eastern and western Europe.",
              "The first record of Roma in Andalusia, the home of Flamenco, is dated 1462 when two other Counts of Little Egypt were invited to dine at the palace of Constable Miguel Lucas de Irizano along with the rest of their troupe of over one hundred people and to be his guests for two weeks.",
              "Another Romani leader, Count James and his wife Countess Louisa, are recorded as visiting Andu\u0301jar, in Andalusia in 1470 (2).",
              "The last Moorish stronghold in Spain, the City of Granada, was captured by the Spanish in 1492 thus ending the Moorish Caliphate in Spain, the flourishing Arabic musical culture and the University and Music conservatory of Cordova.",
              "The Jews were also expelled from Spain in 1492 which does not seem to leave much time from the arrival of the Roma in Spain, to the end of the last Moorish enclave and the expulsion of the Jews for the Moorish and Jewish musical styles to have evolved in combination with that of the Roma and the Spanish Mozarabes (3) in Andalusia to form a new style of music.",
              "Again, Spanish records reveal that the Roma who occupied the caves of the Sacromonte in Granada moved into these caves after the Moors had left.",
              "Other reports reveal that Roma helped the Christian army against the Moors by casting cannon balls for the Christian artillery during the siege of Granada in 1492 (4).",
              "According to Bernard Leblon (5), those Moors who converted to Christianity were expelled from Spain in 1609, but prior to this, the Muslim religion had been outlawed and the Arabic language, music and culture were suppressed.",
              "The Moors who remained in Spain after 1492, led a furtive life as proclaimed \u201cNew Christians\u201d whose potential relapse into heresy was closely watched by the Inquisition.",
              "The same is true of the Jews who converted to Catholicism.",
              "Any contribution either of these banned cultures may have made to Andalusian music after 1492 would have been minimal, if any.",
              "We are then left with the musical culture of the Christian Spanish who had lived under Moorish rule, the Mozarabes.",
              "Here we would expect a living folk tradition based on the fusion of Moorish, Jewish and Andalusian Spanish music to have developed during the 600 or so years of Moorish rule when religious tolerance was practised and all subjects of the Moorish rulers were free to contribute and to learn from the great musical school in Cordova, and elsewhere, sponsored by the Moors.",
              "In other words, the fusion of Spanish, Moorish and Jewish musical styles had to have taken place before the Roma arrived in Andalusia.",
              "The question is \u2013 what was this music and did it survive and evolve into Flamenco?",
              "It was obviously not the classical music of the conservatory of Cordova but folk music performed by the common people which would have been influenced by a fusion of the various musical styles in Andalusia.",
              "Three kinds of stringed instruments are mentioned from this period, but unfortunately surviving specimens only date from the period after the Moorish kingdom of Granada had been conquered.",
              "Among the Moors, the classical instrument was the oud, or lute as it became known in Europe.",
              "The original Moorish lute was unfretted but a fretted version evolved in Spain which rapidly spread to Italy and elsewhere, and by the 13th century had become popular throughout Europe.",
              "Versions of this instrument with and without frets were also brought to the Balkans by the Turks and probably by Romani musicians since the word lavuta, which now means violin in Romani, originally meant lute (6).",
              "A related instrument which vanished from Andalusian and European music was the Perso-Arab long lute (tanbur), as exemplified today by the Turkish saz or the Greek bouzouki.",
              "A long-extinct Italian version was called colascione and was popular in the 16th century.",
              "The classical Spanish stringed instrument was the vihuela, a large guitar-type instrument with a much shallower body and shorter neck than a modern classical guitar, with five double strings and one single and highly decorated.",
              "Four.",
              "\u201cSpanishe vialles,\u201d also called \u201cguittarons\u201d are listed in the inventories of Henry VIII of England and a surviving Spanish guitar dated 17th century has five double strings.",
              "The earliest surviving specimen of a Spanish vihuela is dated as 16th century, but it is mentioned much earlier as a classical or court instrument in Spain that fulfilled the role of the lute in courtly music in the rest of western Europe.",
              "The third stringed instrument was the qitar/khitar from Arabic, a small guitar-type instrument with a flat back and four sets of double strings.",
              "This became a folk instrument and the ancestor of the modern Flamenco guitar.",
              "Clay and metal drums were also a feature of Arabic and Moorish music, but disappeared after the Christian conquest, when music in general and especially folk drums were outlawed by the Church as sinful.",
              "The modern Spanish castanets appear to have their origin in a related wooden folk version of the Arab metal zills or finger cymbals or from some type of wooden clacker.",
              "The Romans had brass castanets and during the Roman era, dancers in Cadiz are mentioned as using brass castanets.",
              "The word castanet (castan\u0303a) comes from Spanish for \u201cchestnut,\u201d the wood from which castanets are traditionally made.",
              "The tambourine or def, which is shown in old illustrations of Spanish Romani musicians in Spain, was also a feature of Arab music, and this survived after the expulsion of the Moors.",
              "Other Moorish classical and folk instruments such as the kanoun (a type of dulcimer), rabab (violin), nai (flute) and others vanished completely from the Andalusian music scene after the conquest of Granada along with the fretted lute.",
              "In 1499 King Fredinand V and Isabella I created the first anti-Romani law in Spain.",
              "In this edict, the Roma were given 60 days in which to cease their nomadism, settle, follow a trade or hire themselves to employers as servants.",
              "Those who continued to wander were given another 60 days to leave Spain or receive one hundred lashes and perpetual exile.",
              "For those who settled and later had a relapse to nomadism, their ears were to be slit and they were to be bound in chains for 60 days.",
              "If they continued to wander, they would then become slaves for life of whoever could capture them (7).",
              "This edict seems to have been generally ignored for some time In 1539, Carlos I issued another edict this time condemning nomadic Roma to the galleys for six years (few survived this long at the oars).",
              "Women found wearing traditional Romani clothes were also condemned to be whipped and banished from Spain for life.",
              "More severe laws followed, much like those in the rest of western Europe and Austro-Hungary under Empress Maria Theresa, which stripped the Spanish Roma of their inflected Romani language and much of their culture, and forced them to settle in gitaneri\u0301as (Gypsy quarters) in the cities and towns throughout Spain.",
              "What is important in the history of Flamenco is that some Romani families did settle voluntarily in Andalusia.",
              "Because some young Romani men had joined the Spanish army and distinguished themselves in the wars in the Spanish Netherlands in the 16th century and during the Moorish revolt (1569-70) their families were allowed to settle in Andalusia.",
              "Romani soldiers also assisted the Spanish in their defence of Ca\u0301diz and Gibraltar when these cities were attacked by the English and the Dutch.",
              "Others supplied grain to the Spanish armies in the field, much like their relatives the Banjara in India supplied grain, salt and water to Indian armies.",
              "Because of these services to the State, this select group of Roma were welcomed and allowed to settle in towns and villages in Andalusia where they took over the trades like blacksmithing which had formerly been done by the Moors.",
              "Among those who received such privileges in 1602 were families with names that evoke Flamenco such as Flores and Montoya.",
              "These select Roma now became Old Castilians and were allowed to settle in such places as Alcala\u0301 la Real, Jae\u0301n Province, Andalusia.",
              "These ex-soldiers who had served in the army in Flanders against the Flemings then gained the nickname of Flemings (Flamencos) by the surrounding Spanish population (8).",
              "This appears to be the most plausible origin of the term Flamenco, a Spanish war veteran of Romani ethnicity.",
              "Later, the term was applied to the music played by the descendants of these original Romani settlers.",
              "Attempts to connect Flamenco with Arabic words do not stand up to analysis since the term Flamenco appeared long after the end of the Moorish rule in Spain and the expulsion of the Moors.",
              "Most students of Flamenco agree that it was the sedentary Roma who developed Flamenco rather than the nomadic Roma.",
              "By the time Flamenco became popular outside of Andalusia there were very few nomadic Roma left in Spain.",
              "We must now address the fusion of music which took place in Andalusia between the Romani newcomers and the long-established folk music culture of Andalusia.",
              "It has been established that the Roma left India in the 11th century AD as a result of the repeated invasions from Afghanistan under the leadership of Mahmud Ghazni.",
              "One or more Rajput armies with their accompanying camp followers, wives and families, fled North into the Upper Indus Valley and from there, were again pressured by the Ghaznavids and left India altogether.",
              "They then followed the Silk Road and passed the Caspian Sea to the Armenian kingdom of Trebizond and the eastern end of the Byzantine Empire on the Black Sea.",
              "Here they remained for a considerable length of time, during which their original Rajput military lingua franca developed into Romani (9).",
              "In this area, they picked up the Byzantine folk music.",
              "Later, under Seljuk rule, they also became exposed to the Perso-Arab maquam musical structure, since many Roma were professional musicians.",
              "They obviously added all of this to their original Indian music, which itself was closely-related to Persian music.",
              "When the Roma later entered the Balkans and moved North, once they left the area of the Ottoman Empire, they encountered European music which did not have this Middle-Eastern musical structure.",
              "In Andalusia, however, they found a folk music with much of the same Middle-Eastern influence and were thus able to fuse this with their existing Middle-Eastern music.",
              "The Middle-Eastern musical structure later became lost in western, central and eastern Europe.",
              "It remained in the Balkans, including Walachia and Moldavia, because of the Ottoman and Greek musical influence in Balkan folk music.",
              "Roma appeared in Europe North of Romania in the early 15th century and by 1450 they were in Spain.",
              "This was not long enough for them to have lost their knowledge of Middle-Eastern music.",
              "How this music got to Spain before the arrival of the Roma is where the confusion arises.",
              "Under Moorish rule, the Spanish city of Cordova became a great centre of music and science.",
              "Scholars, musicians, poets, artisans and craftsmen, including many from Baghdad and other centres of Arab culture elsewhere in the Muslim world, went there to study or to teach, as did scholars from Europe.",
              "This established a direct cultural link between Moorish Spain and the Arab centres of learning in the Middle East and North Africa.",
              "When the Arabs conquered Persia, they adopted the Persian maquam musical structure and built on it.",
              "This music was brought to Moorish Spain.",
              "It is again recorded that musicians from India, notably Sindh, were popular in Baghdad and the Middle East and that they brought their Indian musical structure with them (10).",
              "Thus, the same Indian and Perso-Arab influence that is in Romani music was also brought to Cordova and elsewhere in Moorish Spain to eventually fuse with the local music.",
              "The great music teacher and musician, Ali b.",
              "Nafi, more popularly known as \u201cZiryab\u201d, who was born in the latter 8th century AD, went to Cordova from Baghdad in the early 9th century after a sojourn in North Africa and taught the Eastern music tradition in Moorish Spain.",
              "It is suggested on convincing evidence that Ziryab himself was a member of the Indian Sindhi community in Baghdad which had been long-established by the 8th century AD (11).",
              "In Baghdad, Ziryab modified the old four-string oud (four sets of two), the classical instrument of the period, by adding a fifth course (12).",
              "His oud was also lighter.",
              "It is believed that he was influenced by the fact that the tambur of the Indus Valley in India also had five strings.",
              "In Cordoba, Ziryab is also said to have added a fifth string to the qitar, the four-stringed ancestor of the modern Spanish guitar (13).",
              "This is generally contradicted by modern music historians, who claim the fifth string was added in the 17th century.",
              "The sixth string was added in the 18th century, and the now familiar figure-of-eight body shape did not appear until the early 19th century.",
              "These questions concerning the number of strings may never be settled because there are no surviving specimens of many of the regional variants of the evolving guitar.",
              "The gittern or cittern, which is attributed to the Moors, is sometimes claimed to be a lute-like instrument with four single strings.",
              "A surviving specimen from Elizabethan England has only four single strings.",
              "Far from resembling a lute, it has a flat back and looks more like a violin with F-shaped sound holes and a large opening in the deep, solid neck like a handle, not unlike a carpenter\u2019s hand sander (14).",
              "Like most surviving citterns, it has metal strings.",
              "However, in the 15th century, the European gittern became longer and three double strings and one single string which is at odds with the later Elizabethan specimen.",
              "The Spanish vihuela on the other hand had five double and one single string, in other words, a six-string guitar-type instrument which existed long before the modern six-string guitar which appeared only in the 18th century.",
              "A small Spanish guitar which looks like a diminutive relative of the vihuela is dated 1581 and has holes for ten tuning pegs in the flat head which would indicate five double strings (15).",
              "It is thus possible that a regional guitar ancestor had five double strings in Andalusia at a much earlier date and that no specimens have survived.",
              "Regional folk instruments were not always recorded or described by contemporary writers who were more concerned with court, church and classical music.",
              "Again, the definitive history of the evolution of the modern guitar is not clear especially the regional variations which have become extinct or modified since the period of the Moors in Spain when its original ancestor appeared.",
              "Modern books on the history of musical instruments with photos of surviving specimens show a wide variety of guitar-like instruments dating from the past which left no modern descendants (16).",
              "Originally, the guitar strings were double or a mixture of double and single.",
              "The Moorish technique was to pluck the strings of the lute with a pick or plectrum.",
              "The Mozarabe technique was to strum the guitar in the rasgueado technique with the fingers.",
              "Modern Flamenco uses both techniques, the rasgueado strumming and the punteado or plucking individual strings with the thumb and fingers.",
              "The Flamenco guitar is also lighter and more fragile in construction than the classical guitar, but is louder at the expense of tonal quality.",
              "Purists insist that wooden tuning pegs should be used with the Flamenco guitar instead of metal tuning screws.",
              "It is thus obvious that the instrument and the style of playing the Mozarabe folk guitar were both established before the arrival of the Roma in Andalusia.",
              "The original guitar, however, was a far cry from the modern Flamenco guitar.",
              "It was smaller, oval shaped and had gut frets and strings.",
              "It was designed to accompany singers and dancers.",
              "It was in the 19th and early 20th centuries that the true Spanish guitar developed with its modern body shape, six single strings, metal frets and internal radiating bracing which enabled it to emerge in the 20th century as a virtuoso instrument on the concert stage in the hands of tocaores such as Carlos Montoya and others.",
              "This masterpiece of craftsmanship was then converted to a lump of solid wood with built in electronic gadgets, knobs and levers to be plugged into an ear-shattering sound system by 20th century popular rock musicians catering to whatever current fad was in vogue at the moment.",
              "Hopefully, the acoustic guitar will remain among classical, folk and Flamenco guitarists.",
              "Acoustic guitars need to be amplified on stage in a concert hall or night club and the electric bass is a useful addition to any band or group but non-acoustic noise-makers can hardly be considered to be musical instruments.",
              "So far, we have discussed only the origins of Flamenco music.",
              "What of the dance?",
              "Did the Roma bring the Flamenco dance style to Spain?",
              "Indian temple Kathak dancing is so similar to Flamenco that the coincidence cannot be accidental.",
              "Did the Moors also bring dancers from Middle East to Spain?",
              "This seems very likely and if so, Kathak dancers from Sindh who were brought to Baghdad could easily have come to Cordova along with the musicians to teach their dance.",
              "It is recorded that some Kathak dancers left the temples of India and travelled around entertaining the public to earn their living.",
              "Whether the Roma already had a dance style resembling Kathak when they reached Andalusia or whether they encountered it there as a modified folk dance is unknown, but the style would have been familiar to them.",
              "Kathak dancers dance barefoot and have ankle bells, but the movements and footwork are so similar that Flamenco must have been influenced by Kathak dance style.",
              "However, it is in the Flamenco song that the obvious connection with India appears.",

              "I have seen this happen more than once.",
              "It is thus obvious to me, at least, as a Romani musician, that the basic ingredients of Indian, Moorish, Spanish and Jewish musical traditions developed in Spain under the Moors because of their cultural connections with Baghdad and other centres of music in the Middle East before the Roma arrived and later, the Roma, whose own musical traditions contained most of the same elements, simply built on this Andalusian folk music and created their own unique style of music which we now call Flamenco.",

              "To these we must add elements of some of the folk music of Roma in the Balkans.",

              "Again, removing all possible European influences, a common Romani element can be found in the free style (called rubato by European musicians) which appears in Vlach-Romani, Flamenco and other Romani folk music that is not shared by any European musical tradition.",
              "Other comparisons are also made, especially that the oldest surviving examples of Flamenco are closest to the musical style of the Vlach Roma.",
              "Another similarity I have noticed is the relationship between the Flamenco queji\u0301o, the cry or lament and the kali\u0301 gili\u0301 (tragic song) of the Vlach-Roma, often unaccompanied by music, where the singer tells of his or her agony and suffering in an improvised song.",
              "An example is the Hungarian Vlach-Romani song, Lulugyansa ando Shantso (With the Flowers in the Gutter) which tells of the poverty and suffering of rural Hungarian Vlach Roma who travel to Budapest to do menial work for low pay and end up spending their meagre earnings in taverns to get drunk and forget their misery.",

              "While professional Romani musicians who play in bands usually own steel-string guitars or even electric guitars, many Romani folk musicians play the classical guitar with nylon strings and some have even bought Flamenco guitars in Hungary or elsewhere in Europe.",
              "They also have a technique of playing like the rasgueado, either strumming fast chords with the fingernail of the index finger or with all the fingers in sequence starting with the little finger.",
              "Unlike Flamenco guitarists, they seldom use the capo, most don\u2019t even own one.",
              "The finger-picking style of Flamenco is also used in folk songs and to play introductions.",
              "The free style with flexible structure is common to both Vlach-Romani music and Flamenco, as is the peculiar meter.",
              "Some Romani music groups in Europe have listened to tapes of Romani music from other countries and have picked this music up and then begun to play it in their style.",
              "There are tapes and CDs by artists such as Thierry Robbins who have combined Flamenco with other Romani musical styles, and even with Indian music played by Indian musicians, where it merges in without any problems. Finally, there is the school of Flamenco called Flamenco de Arabe, as recorded by Ishtar y Los Nin\u0303os de Sarah, which has re-introduced the darabuka and darbeki drums and the Arab lute (oud).",
              "To put all of this in perspective what we have is a Romani folk music with roots in India and the Middle East.",
              "In Rumania and down through the Balkans, this element was preserved because of the influence of the Ottoman Empire and the local musical traditions which incorporated Middle-Eastern musical influence.",
              "In Andalusia, the Roma encountered a local folk music inherited from the Moorish period that had much of the same musical input as their own, which they then built on.",
              "While the word Flamenco only appeared in print in English in the 19th century, historical records show that Roma were performing music in Spain soon after they arrived.",
              "As early as the 16th century Romani musicians were already performing in popular and religious festivals.",
              "In Granada, they are recorded as performing as early as 1607, by which date the converted Moors were forbidden to perform at festivals.",
              "Cervantes also describes the travels of La Gitanilla with her musical troupe from village to village to perform at festivals.",
              "What this music was is unknown but may well have been proto-Flamenco.",
              "This Romani music became popular among the non-Romani population and even appeared on the theatre stage performed by Spanish imitators, until a law passed by Philip IV banned them in 1633.",
              "Old illustrations show Roma performing in mixed groups, men playing small guitars and dancing and women playing tambourines or dancing.",
              "These tambourines or panderos are Spanish and larger than the Arab def.",
              "What we can assume is that classical Flamenco as performed by highly-trained groups is far removed from what Flamenco must have been in its formative years when it was limited to the Roma.",
              "Like the blues in America or rembetiko music in Greece, it began as the esoteric music of the ghetto, slums or gitaneri\u0301as, then travelled to the local honky-tonk frequented by its marginalized sub-culture of outcast creators, then to the cafe\u0301s of the aficionados or fans who had suddenly discovered it, and finally to the concert stage.",
              "There it was stripped of its raw folk origin when adopted by the genteel sophisticates, stylised and made more acceptable to those who had never known the pain of rejection, jails, hunger and persecution.",
              "Performers now needed extensive musical education and training and the music was no longer ethnic or limited to an hereditary group of performers performing in the pure folk tradition.",
              "Flamenco puro remained only among the gitanos, especially in the caves of Sacro Monte.",
              "While it is impossible to really define what the Roma contributed to Flamenco, we might ask: would Flamenco have ever existed if the Roma had never gone to Spain in the 15th century?",
              "Probably not as we know it today.",
              "In Spain, it is commonly believed that while Flamenco was created in Cordova, it was preserved and developed in Granada and elsewhere in Andalusia by the original family groups of Roma.",
              "From Andalusia it spread outward to the rest of Spain where it soon became the folk music of the Gitanos.",
              "From the local taverns in the gitaneri\u0301as and the villages it moved to the cafe\u0301s cantantes which flourished between 1860 and 1915 and from there to the concert stage.",
              "Originally, it was the cantaor or singer who reigned supreme accompanied by hand clapping or rapping on the table.",
              "Then the dancers became popular.",
              "It was only in the 20th century that the guitarist emerged from his subservient role as accompanist to be recognised as a virtuoso in his own right.",
              "Now there is a vast difference between a group of Gitanos playing Flamenco in Granada and a Flamenco production on the concert stage.",
              "There are probably more Flamenco guitarists and dancers outside of Spain than in Spain itself.",
              "The cantaor (singer), however, remains indigenous to Andalusia.",
              "One requirement is that Flamenco be sung in Andalusian Spanish and (apparently) that it be incomprehensible to foreigners who speak fluent Castilian Spanish.",
              "From Flamenco Puro to Flamenco Rumba, Flamenco Pop, Flamenco Arabe and The Gypsy Kings, Flamenco has diverged in the latter 20th century into many different forms and will obviously continue to develop, perhaps into Flamenco Rap.",
              "Its roots are evident, its development unknown and its future unpredictable but there is no denying its popularity and appeal.",

              "(There, the Roma people are called Gitanos.)",
              "The roots of flamenco, though somewhat mysterious, seem to lie in the Roma migration from Rajasthan (in northwest India) to Spain between the 9th and 14th centuries.",
              "These migrants brought with them musical instruments, such as tambourines, bells, and wooden castanets, and an extensive repertoire of songs and dances.",
              "In Spain they encountered the rich cultures of the Sephardic Jews and the Moors.",
              "Their centuries-long cultural intermingling produced the unique art form known as flamenco.",
              "The essence of flamenco is cante, or song.",
              "Flamenco songs fall into three categories: cante jondo (\u201cprofound song,\u201d or \u201cdeep song\u201d), cante intermedio (\u201cintermediate song,\u201d also called cante flamenco), and cante chico (\u201clight song\u201d).",
              "The cante jondo, whose structure usually is based on a complex 12-beat rhythm, is thought to be the oldest form.",
              "It is characterized by profound emotion and deals with themes of death, anguish, despair, or religious doubt.",
              "The cante intermedio is a hybrid form that incorporates elements of Spanish music styles, especially the fandango.",
              "The cante chico, which is generally simpler in rhythm than the other two forms, also requires considerable technical skill but much less emotional investment, dealing as it usually does with humour and subjects of love, the countryside, and gaiety.",
              "Each song style is distinguished by a characteristic rhythm and chord structure;",
              "yet several types of cante may share the same rhythm but individualize accentuation, subtleties, and emotional content.",
              "The ancestry of many types of song is traceable.",
              "Thus, the serious soleares, a descendant of the much older can\u0303as, gave rise to the light alegri\u0301as, from which developed other light-song types, such as the buleri\u0301as.",
              "The alborea\u0301s is traditionally sung only at weddings and is considered unlucky on other occasions.",
              "Other forms, such as the fandangos grandes, were adopted from Spanish folk song and dance, the fandangos becoming more serious in character than the original and begetting a series of descendants that includes the malaguen\u0303as and the Arab-influenced cartageneras.",
              "Latin American influence appears in later genres such as the rumbas gitanas and the colombianas.",
              "Most deeply associated with Gitano flamenco tradition are the cantes grandes, such as the siguiriyas gitanas;",
              "the saetas, adopted from Spanish religious processions;",
              "and the martinetes, an early song type created in the environment of the forge, in which the beat of the hammer against the anvil reflects the pain and sense of persecution felt by the perpetual outsider.",
              "After the mid-19th century, flamenco song was usually accompanied by guitar music and a palo seco (Spanish: \u201cdry stick,\u201d a stick that was beat on the floor to keep time) and a dancer performing a series of choreographed dance steps and improvised styles.",
              "Baile, or dance, has been the dominant element of flamenco since that time, though it is never performed without accompaniment.",
              "As an accompanist to the dancer (bailaor [male], bailaora [female]), the singer (cantaor) relates the legends and stories of daily life that reflect the experiences of an outcast subculture within predominately white, Christian Spain.",
              "The dancer is the protagonist of the singer\u2019s narrative and its interpreter.",
              "The baile is a sensuous display of fluid motion, stylized and yet highly personal, involving movement of the arms (braceo) and upper torso, hand and finger movement (florea), footwork (zapateado), and heelwork (taconeo), which are often displayed in long solo passages (solea).",
              "Male dancers usually perform intricate footwork, whereas female dancers, traditionally wearing elaborately ruffled dresses, emphasize the hands and upper torso.",
              "The guitarist (tocoar) keeps the rhythm (compa\u0301s) necessary to the dancer\u2019s individual rhythmic cadences, accompanying (and, when the performance space is large, even following) the dancer.",
              "A deeply musical dancer, after a 15- or 20-minute sequence, is said to fall into a duende, an intensely focused, trancelike state of transcendent emotion that Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca in 1933 described as los sonidos negros (\u201cthe dark sounds\u201d) invading the performer\u2019s body.",
              "This extraordinary state is enhanced by rhythmic hand clapping and encouraging interjections (jaleo) from the audience and fellow performers.",
              "Gitano flamenco performers regard the cante jondo as a form of prayer, and thus, in duende, the dancer communicates with both the audience and God.",
              "What may well reveal the ancient origins of flamenco are the gestures of the profound dance (baile grande), in which the arm, hand, and foot movements closely resemble those of classical Hindu dance of the Indian subcontinent.",
              "The golden age of flamenco is usually considered to be the period between roughly 1780 and 1845.",
              "Singing was then the primary aspect of flamenco, dancing and musical accompaniment being secondary.",
              "What had been an essentially outdoor, outsider, family-oriented activity that focused on cante was transformed beginning in 1842, when Silverio Franconetti founded the first cafe\u0301 cantante, Cafe\u0301 sin Nombre, in Sevilla (Seville).",
              "That establishment and the many others that sprang up in the major urban centres of Spain\u2014notably Granada, Co\u0301rdoba, and Sevilla\u2014placed emphasis on the musicians and dancers, and it was in this period that the singer began to take a secondary role.",
              "Although these commercial interests afforded a living for many performers for the first time, they also brought about what many considered a bastardization of an authentic indigenous art form.",
              "Several intellectuals, including Lorca and composer Manuel de Falla, sought to restore the purity of flamenco, and in 1922 they instituted the first flamenco competition\u2014calling for cante primitivo andaluz (\u201cprimitive Andalusian cante\u201d).",
              "This timely attempt to prevent the further debasement of an authentic folk art effectively promoted flamenco to a sophisticated urban public and helped to further the thoughtful development of the art within a modern context.",
              "Among the many great early 20th-century performers are La Argentina (Antonia Merce\u0301), Vicente Escudero, Carmen Amaya, La Argentinita (Encarnacio\u0301n Lo\u0301pez), Jose\u0301 Greco, and Pilar Lo\u0301pez, as well as the troupes of Antonio and Rosario (Antonio Ruiz Soler and Rosario Florencia Pe\u0301rez Podilla) and Xime\u0301nez-Vargas (Roberto Xime\u0301nez and Manolo Vargas).",
              "Classically influenced flamenco artists Antonio Gades, Christina Hoyos, Jose\u0301 Greco II, and Lola Greco have also pushed the boundaries of flamenco.",
              "Gades in particular, in his collaborations with the filmmaker Carlos Saura, introduced flamenco to an international audience, demonstrating through his ingenious choreographic direction the dimensions of flamenco as an expandable performance art.",
              "Contemporary artists such as Eva la Yerbabuena, Joaqui\u0301n Corte\u0301s, Antonio Canales, Bele\u0301n Maya, and Juana Amaya are creating new rhythmic strategies in the studio and integrating them into longer narrative theatre pieces in which rhythm becomes the dominant element of the dance.",
              "In the last few decades of the 20th century, flamenco also was influenced by the general musical trend toward fusion of styles."

              "By Philologos April 16, 2004 In the April issue of the magazine Moment there is a short item about the possible Jewish roots of flamenco or Spanish gypsy music.",
              "\u201cAlthough not everybody finds Jewish overtones in the rhythmic dancing, the wailing style of songs, and the lush, intricate guitar playing,\u201d writes Moment contributor Debra Bruno, \u201cmany believe that flamenco is closely linked to Sephardic synagogue music with its eastern influences and undercurrent of sadness.",
              ".",
              ".",
              ".",
              "The word \u2018flamenco\u2019 supposedly derives from the Spanish word for Flemish.",
              "Why?",
              "One theory is that the word came from the religious songs of those Jews who escaped the Inquisition by moving to the northern European region of Flanders.",
              "\u201d Actually, as musicologists have observed, flamenco is not so much related to Sephardic synagogue music as it is to Ashkenazi synagogue music, and specifically, to the hazzanut or high cantorial style of Eastern Europe, whose scales and modulations can at times remind one remarkably of flamenco singing.",
              "Hazzanut\u2019s ultimate origins, of course, are Eastern.",
              "Whether or not, as some authorities have argued, they go all the way back to the singing of the Levites in the Temple, or simply share a single eastern Mediterranean source with Arabic music, whose influence on flamenco was enormous, they can be clearly heard in the cante jondo, the \u201cdeep song\u201d that is flamenco as its purest.",
              "Not that close parallels to flamenco can\u2019t be detected in Sephardic music, too.",
              "As Ms.",
              "Bruno observes, there are Sephardic songs or romanc\u0327eros, such as the well-known one called \u201cLa Petenera,\u201d with its line \u201cDo\u0301nde vas bella judi\u0301a?",
              "\u201d (\u201cWhere are you going, you Jewish beauty?",
              "\u201d), that have cante jondo elements.",
              "The fact that such a song was taken with them in their wanderings by Jewish exiles from Spain in 1492 demonstrates that it belongs to the earliest stage of flamenco singing, whose known history does not go back much further.",
              "That flamenco has a Jewish musical background as well as an Arab one is generally accepted by most scholars.",
              "Thoughtful, balanced reporting from the Forward and around the web, bringing you updated news and analysis of the crisis each day.",
              "But does any of this justify the theory that the word \u201cflamenco\u201d itself has to do with Jews?",
              "I\u2019m dubious.",
              "Flamenco in Spanish has two meanings, \u201cFlemish\u201d and \u201cflamingo.",
              "\u201d Most likely these are related.",
              "The Spanish had close contact with the Flemings, because Flanders, the Dutch-speaking area of what today is Belgium, was under the occupation of the Spanish Hapsburgs for nearly 300 years until the French Revolution.",
              "Even earlier than that, however, flamenco in Spanish had taken on the sense of ruddy or fair-skinned, the Flemings, like other northerners, being lighter-complexioned than the generally darker Spaniards.",
              "And because a ruddy pink is the color of the flamingo\u2019s under-wings, which flash spectacularly when the bird takes off and flies, it came to be called flamenco too.",
              "But why should this word also have been used for the passionate, deep-throated singing of Spanish gypsies?",
              "The notion, found in various books and articles, that this usage came from Jewish exiles who took songs like \u201cLa Petenera\u201d with them to the Netherlands strikes me as far-fetched.",
              "At a time when flamenco continued to be sung and to develop most vigorously in Spain itself, especially in the Andalusian south, why on earth would the Spanish have named it for songs sung by Jews in the distant north, even if they were the same as those they sang themselves?",
              "Much more sensible is the explanation given by the Catalonian lexicographer Joan Corominas in his Breve Diccionario Etimolo\u0301gico de la Lengua Castellana, in which \u2014 after tracing the earliest musical use of the word flamenco to 1870, hundreds of years too late for it to have anything to do with Jews in Flanders \u2014 he shows how it went from meaning \u201cfair-skinned\u201d to \u201cfine-looking,\u201d \u201cattractive\u201d and \u201cdashing,\u201d and from there, because of the colorful dress and appearance of many gypsies, to \u201cgypsy-like.",
              "\u201d Flamenco was simply music sung by gypsies.",
              "Flamenco music has a vocabulary and words all its own, like duende, the sense of tragic emotion with which great flamenco is sung, or juerga, a spontaneous flamenco \u201cjam session\u201d at which singers improvise and pour their hearts out in a way rarely heard at scheduled performances.",
              "My wife and I once had the privilege of stumbling on a juerga while on a trip to Andalusia.",
              "We had driven to a small-town fiesta, a day of celebration with country dancing and music, only to discover to our dismay, upon arriving in the evening, that we were too late and that the fiesta had broken up and everyone was going home.",
              "Only a few, small groups of musicians and singers still stood in tight circles under the darkening sky, loath to end the clearly marvelous day we had missed.",
              "One of these circles was composed of gypsies singing cante jondo to each other, tolerantly oblivious to the handful of spectators who had gathered around them.",
              "They were not performing for anyone.",
              "They were talking to each other in song, making up the words as they went along: passionately, lovingly, sorrowfully, joyfully, gut-wrenchingly.",
              "I had never heard such singing before in my life and don\u2019t expect ever to hear it again.",
              "I would be proud as a Jew to be connected to it in any way, even if the etymological rights aren\u2019t mine.",

              "Moreover, from the mid-nineteenth century on, flamenco entertainment spread quickly from southern Spain to the capital (Madrid) and onward to other Spanish urban centers, flourishing there as a consequence of the rise of a mass urban culture and increased foreign tourism.",
              "The reason for flamenco\u2019s horrible reputation among Spanish elites during the 19th and 20th centuries was that historically, performances were associated with the ostracized Gypsy (Roma) population in Spain, and they took place in seedy urban areas.",

              "Flamenco came to encapsulate Spanish elites\u2019 feelings of shame about the country\u2019s declining status as a great power in the modern era.",

              "To counteract its perceived evils, they promoted folk dancing and singing, encouraging a new kind of national identity predicated on Spanish regional diversity and cleansed of flamenco\u2019s torrid reputation.",
              "But by the 1950s, after years of international isolation, the Franco regime needed money.",
              "This led the regime to change course, promoting flamenco in order to jump-start Spain\u2019s tourist industry.",

              "\u201d So the Franco regime pandered to tourists\u2019 love of flamenco, increasing the number of clubs that specialized in it, advertising female flamenco dancers on tourism and airline brochures, encouraging professional flamenco performers to star in Hollywood films, and featuring performers in traveling exhibitions like the 1964-1965 New York World\u2019s Fair.",
              "These strategies worked;",

              "The nearly simultaneous movements for regional autonomy within Spain and the growth of a world music culture complicated flamenco\u2019s relationship to Spanish national identity.",
              "The foreign depiction of Spain as the land of flamenco, the not-quite European country with the Oriental-Gypsy soul, has been exploited by entrepreneurial spirits within Spain.",

              "Inside Spain, however, the relationship between the flamenco art form and Spanish national identity has been fraught for more than a century.",
              "Indeed, the world\u2019s love of flamenco has long created problems within Spain, where the performance was once considered a vulgar and pornographic spectacle.",
              "Over the years, many Spaniards considered flamenco a scourge of their nation, deploring it as an entertainment that lulled the masses into stupefaction and hampered Spain\u2019s progress toward modernity.",
              "Flamenco\u2019s shifting fortunes show how Spain\u2019s complex national identity continues to evolve to this day.",
              "Flamenco, which UNESCO recently recognized as part of the World\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage, is a complex art form incorporating poetry, singing (cante), guitar playing (toque), dance (baile), polyrhythmic hand-clapping (palmas), and finger snapping (pitos).",
              "It often features the call and response known as jaleo, a form of \u201chell raising,\u201d involving hand clapping, foot stomping, and audiences\u2019 encouraging shouts.",
              "Nobody really knows where the term \u201cflamenco\u201d originated, but all agree that the art form began in southern Spain\u2014Andalusia and Murcia\u2014but was also shaped by musicians and performers in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Europe.",
              "Moreover, from the mid-nineteenth century on, flamenco entertainment spread quickly from southern Spain to the capital (Madrid) and onward to other Spanish urban centers, flourishing there as a consequence of the rise of a mass urban culture and increased foreign tourism.",
              "The reason for flamenco\u2019s horrible reputation among Spanish elites during the 19th and 20th centuries was that historically, performances were associated with the ostracized Gypsy (Roma) population in Spain, and they took place in seedy urban areas.",
              "Spanish elites particularly despised how foreigners linked Spain with flamenco.",
              "Spain\u2019s national identity had previously been defined by outsiders who tied the country to Inquisitors, beggars, bandits, bullfighters, Gypsies, and flamenco dancers.",
              "Usually foreigners imposed the flamenco identity onto Spain as a backhanded compliment to highlight Spain\u2019s steadfast authenticity.",
              "The nation had not fallen prey to the soul-sucking effects of industrialization.",
              "But with very few exceptions, Spanish elites and social reformers never liked\u2014nor wanted\u2014this art form to represent themselves or their nation, and they fought flamenco fever with all the resources they could muster.",
              "But flamencomania proved much more difficult to eradicate than the so-called Black Legend: the negative propaganda, spread by Spain\u2019s French and British rivals, that characterized Spain as the land of cruel Inquisitors, sadistic colonial rulers, repressive politicians, and intellectual and artistic yokels.",
              "Flamenco came to encapsulate Spanish elites\u2019 feelings of shame about the country\u2019s declining status as a great power in the modern era.",
              "Flamenco\u2019s critics were divided into three main groups: the Catholic Church and its conservative allies, left-leaning intellectuals and politicians, and leaders from revolutionary workers\u2019 movements.",
              "During the convulsive period between the Restoration and the beginning of the civil war, from 1875 to 1936, these groups used flamenco to critique what they saw as Spain\u2019s political, economic, and cultural ills.",
              "The Catholic Church perceived flamenco as an offshoot of the sort of mass cultural entertainments that led to immodesty, the breakdown of the family, and the weakening of the Patria.",
              "But for many progressive intellectuals, by contrast, flamenco\u2014along with its twin scourge, bullfighting\u2014was thought to keep Spaniards in a stranglehold of backwardness.",
              "They saw the entertainment as a distraction that prevented Spaniards from solving the nation\u2019s numerous ills, including a corrupt political system, a wildly inadequate and unequal educational system, a lack of infrastructure and technological know-how, and vast inequalities of wealth.",
              "Meanwhile, for working-class reformers and revolutionaries, flamenco and its concomitant lifestyle exploited people\u2019s poverty and diverted workers away from becoming full actors in seeking revolution to end social, political, and economic inequality.",
              "In reality, all of these groups used flamenco as a vessel to contain their dissatisfaction with the ideological and structural changes that emerged out of the French and Industrial Revolutions.",
              "They railed in newspaper diatribes against this form of entertainment, with some critics seeing flamenco as the perverted outcome of increased secularization, while others thought it showed resistance to progress and modernization.",

              "Their centuries-long cultural intermingling produced the unique art form known as flamenco.",
              "The essence of flamenco is cante, or song.",
              "Flamenco songs fall into three categories: cante jondo (\u201cprofound song,\u201d or \u201cdeep song\u201d), cante intermedio (\u201cintermediate song,\u201d also called cante flamenco), and cante chico (\u201clight song\u201d).",
              "The cante jondo, whose structure usually is based on a complex 12-beat rhythm, is thought to be the oldest form.",
              "It is characterized by profound emotion and deals with themes of death, anguish, despair, or religious doubt.",
              "The cante intermedio is a hybrid form that incorporates elements of Spanish music styles, especially the fandango.",
              "The cante chico, which is generally simpler in rhythm than the other two forms, also requires considerable technical skill but much less emotional investment, dealing as it usually does with humour and subjects of love, the countryside, and gaiety.",
              "Each song style is distinguished by a characteristic rhythm and chord structure;",
              "yet several types of cante may share the same rhythm but individualize accentuation, subtleties, and emotional content.",
              "The ancestry of many types of song is traceable.",
              "Thus, the serious soleares, a descendant of the much older can\u0303as, gave rise to the light alegri\u0301as, from which developed other light-song types, such as the buleri\u0301as.",
              "The alborea\u0301s is traditionally sung only at weddings and is considered unlucky on other occasions.",
              "Other forms, such as the fandangos grandes, were adopted from Spanish folk song and dance, the fandangos becoming more serious in character than the original and begetting a series of descendants that includes the malaguen\u0303as and the Arab-influenced cartageneras.",
              "Latin American influence appears in later genres such as the rumbas gitanas and the colombianas.",
              "Most deeply associated with Gitano flamenco tradition are the cantes grandes, such as the siguiriyas gitanas;",
              "the saetas, adopted from Spanish religious processions;",
              "and the martinetes, an early song type created in the environment of the forge, in which the beat of the hammer against the anvil reflects the pain and sense of persecution felt by the perpetual outsider.",
              "After the mid-19th century, flamenco song was usually accompanied by guitar music and a palo seco (Spanish: \u201cdry stick,\u201d a stick that was beat on the floor to keep time) and a dancer performing a series of choreographed dance steps and improvised styles.",
              "Baile, or dance, has been the dominant element of flamenco since that time, though it is never performed without accompaniment.",
              "As an accompanist to the dancer (bailaor [male], bailaora [female]), the singer (cantaor) relates the legends and stories of daily life that reflect the experiences of an outcast subculture within predominately white, Christian Spain.",
              "The dancer is the protagonist of the singer\u2019s narrative and its interpreter.",
              "The baile is a sensuous display of fluid motion, stylized and yet highly personal, involving movement of the arms (braceo) and upper torso, hand and finger movement (florea), footwork (zapateado), and heelwork (taconeo), which are often displayed in long solo passages (solea).",
              "Male dancers usually perform intricate footwork, whereas female dancers, traditionally wearing elaborately ruffled dresses, emphasize the hands and upper torso.",
              "The guitarist (tocoar) keeps the rhythm (compa\u0301s) necessary to the dancer\u2019s individual rhythmic cadences, accompanying (and, when the performance space is large, even following) the dancer.",
              "A deeply musical dancer, after a 15- or 20-minute sequence, is said to fall into a duende, an intensely focused, trancelike state of transcendent emotion that Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca in 1933 described as los sonidos negros (\u201cthe dark sounds\u201d) invading the performer\u2019s body.",
              "This extraordinary state is enhanced by rhythmic hand clapping and encouraging interjections (jaleo) from the audience and fellow performers.",
              "Gitano flamenco performers regard the cante jondo as a form of prayer, and thus, in duende, the dancer communicates with both the audience and God.",
              "What may well reveal the ancient origins of flamenco are the gestures of the profound dance (baile grande), in which the arm, hand, and foot movements closely resemble those of classical Hindu dance of the Indian subcontinent.",
              "The golden age of flamenco is usually considered to be the period between roughly 1780 and 1845.",
              "Singing was then the primary aspect of flamenco, dancing and musical accompaniment being secondary.",
              "What had been an essentially outdoor, outsider, family-oriented activity that focused on cante was transformed beginning in 1842, when Silverio Franconetti founded the first cafe\u0301 cantante, Cafe\u0301 sin Nombre, in Sevilla (Seville).",
              "That establishment and the many others that sprang up in the major urban centres of Spain\u2014notably Granada, Co\u0301rdoba, and Sevilla\u2014placed emphasis on the musicians and dancers, and it was in this period that the singer began to take a secondary role.",
              "Although these commercial interests afforded a living for many performers for the first time, they also brought about what many considered a bastardization of an authentic indigenous art form.",
              "Several intellectuals, including Lorca and composer Manuel de Falla, sought to restore the purity of flamenco, and in 1922 they instituted the first flamenco competition\u2014calling for cante primitivo andaluz (\u201cprimitive Andalusian cante\u201d).",
              "This timely attempt to prevent the further debasement of an authentic folk art effectively promoted flamenco to a sophisticated urban public and helped to further the thoughtful development of the art within a modern context.",
              "Among the many great early 20th-century performers are La Argentina (Antonia Merce\u0301), Vicente Escudero, Carmen Amaya, La Argentinita (Encarnacio\u0301n Lo\u0301pez), Jose\u0301 Greco, and Pilar Lo\u0301pez, as well as the troupes of Antonio and Rosario (Antonio Ruiz Soler and Rosario Florencia Pe\u0301rez Podilla) and Xime\u0301nez-Vargas (Roberto Xime\u0301nez and Manolo Vargas).",

              "Gades in particular, in his collaborations with the filmmaker Carlos Saura, introduced flamenco to an international audience, demonstrating through his ingenious choreographic direction the dimensions of flamenco as an expandable performance art.",
              "Contemporary artists such as Eva la Yerbabuena, Joaqui\u0301n Corte\u0301s, Antonio Canales, Bele\u0301n Maya, and Juana Amaya are creating new rhythmic strategies in the studio and integrating them into longer narrative theatre pieces in which rhythm becomes the dominant element of the dance.",

              "The first two prizes went to El Tenazas and El Caracol.",
              "There are many variants of cantes or palos (song forms), each expressing a unique emotion (which shares noticeable resemblance to Indian classical music).",

              "Also known as cante jondo and sometimes referred to as cante gitano.",
              "Meaning \"profound\" and \"deep,\" this intensely sad form of cante deals with themes of death, anguish, despair, or religious sentiments and may be sung a palo seco (without guitar accompaniment).",
              "Major forms are the tona\u0301s, martinetes, seguiriya, solea\u0301, and carcelera.",
              "It is said that cante jondo (deep song) is the heart and soul of flamenco: The singer who sings seguiriyas leaves in each line of the copla (verse of cante) a piece of his soul;",
              "and, if not, he is deceiving the listener, perhaps even himself.",
              "If there is one style to which the singer has to give everything, has to give every bit of himself, it is the siguiriya.",
              "I have seen Jose\u0301 Menese completely overcome, broken, a literal wreck after doing this song and I believe that if the singer sometimes reaches the kind of state of grace that the Gypsies call duende - and I don't know yet what that is - it is in these unique and unrepeatable moments.",
              "Sample Seguiria describing anguish in Calo\u0301, Spanish and English: Meaning \"intermediate,\" this form is less profound but also moving, sometimes containing an oriental cast to the music.",
              "The term (between cante chico and cante grande that is) varies according to who is singing and describing the \"cante intermedio\".",
              "Literally meaning \"little song,\" this form of cante sings of lighter subjects including love, bawdy humor and happiness to the accompaniment of the flamenco guitar.",
              "Festive forms of cante chico include forms such as the alegri\u0301as, buleri\u0301as and tangos.",
              "Cante gitano (or the \"Gypsy song\") refers to the original songs believed to be developed by Gypsies who immigrated in the 15th century.",
              "These include the tona\u0301, solea\u0301, seguiriya, tango and buleria.",
              "Cante andaluz began to spread during the middle of the 19th century, and is a combination of other forms of folkloric music from Andalusia which demonstrate a definite influence of Gypsy flamenco music.",
              "Cante andaluz genres include the many variations of the fandango and cantinas.",
              "The styles of cantes folklo\u0301ricos aflamencados are forms of cante that are not considered to be true forms of flamenco by the purists.",
              "Examples of these styles include the sevillanas, Farruca, Garrotin, and the Cuban Rumba.",
              "These are the folk song and dances from Andalusia, other Spanish provinces including Galicia and Asturias, as well as South America which have been slightly influenced by traditional flamenco forms. Lorquen\u0303a is a \"aflamencado\" that has been made from certain ancient folk songs based on the poems of Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca.",
              "[2] The poet himself collected these folk songs that were included gypsies and flamenco lyrics and gathered in his collection of ancient popular songs.",
              "Among these traditional songs were the tunes, buleri\u0301as, jaleos and seguidillas that Lorca himself recorded in 1931 accompanying the famous singer \"La Argentinita\" with the piano.",
              "[3] The lorquen\u0303a comes from Granada and is based on the buleri\u0301a style.",
              "[4] The gypsy Pastora Mari\u0301a Pavo\u0301n Cruz known as \"La Nin\u0303a de los Peines\" was a very famous cantaora flamenca from Seville.",
              "She took the poems of Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca as lyrics of new songs and was the first person to call it Lorquen\u0303a.",
              "[5] Although concrete information about El Planeta is scarce, it is thought he was born around 1770 in Cadiz.",
              "He is widely acknowledged as the first famous performer of the cante flamenco.",
              "Originally a blacksmith, El Planeta soon became a renowned leader within the Gypsy community, bearing the honorary title of \"Count and Prince of the Fraternity.\"",
              "It is believed he usually sang unaccompanied, although he sometimes accompanied himself on the guitar.",
              "The oldest siguiriyas in recorded flamenco history are those of El Planeta.",
              "He died around 1850, most likely in or around Seville.",
              "Born around 1820 in Villa Real, El Fillo was the chosen disciple of El Planeta.",
              "El Fillo was able to perform all forms of cante, and has thus been known as \"the father of cante.\"",
              "His hoarse, harsh voice has become a defining characteristic of cante to this day - this style of singing is described as afilla in homage to him.",
              "It is believed that El Fillo died in 1878 in Seville.",
              "Born 1829, Silverio Franaconnetti was born in Moro\u0301n de la Frontera was expected to enter the family tailoring business, but would escape to the nearby blacksmith to hear the gypsy singers.",
              "Here he met El Fillo and was encouraged to become a singer.",
              "He later went to Argentina and Uruguay working as a picador in the bullrings, and he also served as an officer in the Uruguay Army.",
              "Franconnetti was arguably the best non-Gypsy singer of the Nineteenth Century.",
              "He died in 1889.",
              "Born in Seville in 1890, La Nin\u0303a de Los Peines is regarded by some as the most exceptional and innovative female flamenco singer of all time.",
              "Affectionately called \"La Nin\u0303a,\" she was known for her interpretation of the tangos, and was often requested to sing siguiriyas at a time when women did not customarily perform it.",
              "Manolo Caracol came from an exalted Gypsy dynasty which to this day remains legendary in the arenas of both flamenco and bullfighting.",
              "Born in Seville in 1909, it is commonly believed that his ancestral lineage included both El Planeta and El Fillo.",

              "Although trained as a traditional flamenco singer, Camaro\u0301n broke with convention, incorporating new musical instruments including the drums, zither, flute, moog, and keyboards to name a few.",
              "In his comparatively short career of 20 years, he and Paco de Luci\u0301a revolutionized the art of flamenco, attracting vast new audiences to the art form.",

              "(There, the Roma people are called Gitanos.)",
              "The roots of flamenco, though somewhat mysterious, seem to lie in the Roma migration from Rajasthan (in northwest India) to Spain between the 9th and 14th centuries.",
              "These migrants brought with them musical instruments, such as tambourines, bells, and wooden castanets, and an extensive repertoire of songs and dances.",
              "In Spain they encountered the rich cultures of the Sephardic Jews and the Moors.",
              "Their centuries-long cultural intermingling produced the unique art form known as flamenco.",
              "The essence of flamenco is cante, or song.",
              "Flamenco songs fall into three categories: cante jondo (\u201cprofound song,\u201d or \u201cdeep song\u201d), cante intermedio (\u201cintermediate song,\u201d also called cante flamenco), and cante chico (\u201clight song\u201d).",
              "The cante jondo, whose structure usually is based on a complex 12-beat rhythm, is thought to be the oldest form.",
              "It is characterized by profound emotion and deals with themes of death, anguish, despair, or religious doubt.",
              "The cante intermedio is a hybrid form that incorporates elements of Spanish music styles, especially the fandango.",
              "The cante chico, which is generally simpler in rhythm than the other two forms, also requires considerable technical skill but much less emotional investment, dealing as it usually does with humour and subjects of love, the countryside, and gaiety.",
              "Each song style is distinguished by a characteristic rhythm and chord structure;",
              "yet several types of cante may share the same rhythm but individualize accentuation, subtleties, and emotional content.",
              "The ancestry of many types of song is traceable.",
              "Thus, the serious soleares, a descendant of the much older can\u0303as, gave rise to the light alegri\u0301as, from which developed other light-song types, such as the buleri\u0301as.",
              "The alborea\u0301s is traditionally sung only at weddings and is considered unlucky on other occasions.",
              "Other forms, such as the fandangos grandes, were adopted from Spanish folk song and dance, the fandangos becoming more serious in character than the original and begetting a series of descendants that includes the malaguen\u0303as and the Arab-influenced cartageneras.",
              "Latin American influence appears in later genres such as the rumbas gitanas and the colombianas.",
              "Most deeply associated with Gitano flamenco tradition are the cantes grandes, such as the siguiriyas gitanas;",
              "the saetas, adopted from Spanish religious processions;",
              "and the martinetes, an early song type created in the environment of the forge, in which the beat of the hammer against the anvil reflects the pain and sense of persecution felt by the perpetual outsider.",
              "After the mid-19th century, flamenco song was usually accompanied by guitar music and a palo seco (Spanish: \u201cdry stick,\u201d a stick that was beat on the floor to keep time) and a dancer performing a series of choreographed dance steps and improvised styles.",
              "Baile, or dance, has been the dominant element of flamenco since that time, though it is never performed without accompaniment.",
              "As an accompanist to the dancer (bailaor [male], bailaora [female]), the singer (cantaor) relates the legends and stories of daily life that reflect the experiences of an outcast subculture within predominately white, Christian Spain.",
              "The dancer is the protagonist of the singer\u2019s narrative and its interpreter.",
              "The baile is a sensuous display of fluid motion, stylized and yet highly personal, involving movement of the arms (braceo) and upper torso, hand and finger movement (florea), footwork (zapateado), and heelwork (taconeo), which are often displayed in long solo passages (solea).",
              "Male dancers usually perform intricate footwork, whereas female dancers, traditionally wearing elaborately ruffled dresses, emphasize the hands and upper torso.",
              "The guitarist (tocoar) keeps the rhythm (compa\u0301s) necessary to the dancer\u2019s individual rhythmic cadences, accompanying (and, when the performance space is large, even following) the dancer.",
              "A deeply musical dancer, after a 15- or 20-minute sequence, is said to fall into a duende, an intensely focused, trancelike state of transcendent emotion that Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca in 1933 described as los sonidos negros (\u201cthe dark sounds\u201d) invading the performer\u2019s body.",
              "This extraordinary state is enhanced by rhythmic hand clapping and encouraging interjections (jaleo) from the audience and fellow performers.",
              "Gitano flamenco performers regard the cante jondo as a form of prayer, and thus, in duende, the dancer communicates with both the audience and God.",
              "What may well reveal the ancient origins of flamenco are the gestures of the profound dance (baile grande), in which the arm, hand, and foot movements closely resemble those of classical Hindu dance of the Indian subcontinent.",
              "The golden age of flamenco is usually considered to be the period between roughly 1780 and 1845.",
              "Singing was then the primary aspect of flamenco, dancing and musical accompaniment being secondary.",
              "What had been an essentially outdoor, outsider, family-oriented activity that focused on cante was transformed beginning in 1842, when Silverio Franconetti founded the first cafe\u0301 cantante, Cafe\u0301 sin Nombre, in Sevilla (Seville).",
              "That establishment and the many others that sprang up in the major urban centres of Spain\u2014notably Granada, Co\u0301rdoba, and Sevilla\u2014placed emphasis on the musicians and dancers, and it was in this period that the singer began to take a secondary role.",
              "Although these commercial interests afforded a living for many performers for the first time, they also brought about what many considered a bastardization of an authentic indigenous art form.",
              "Several intellectuals, including Lorca and composer Manuel de Falla, sought to restore the purity of flamenco, and in 1922 they instituted the first flamenco competition\u2014calling for cante primitivo andaluz (\u201cprimitive Andalusian cante\u201d).",
              "This timely attempt to prevent the further debasement of an authentic folk art effectively promoted flamenco to a sophisticated urban public and helped to further the thoughtful development of the art within a modern context.",
              "Among the many great early 20th-century performers are La Argentina (Antonia Merce\u0301), Vicente Escudero, Carmen Amaya, La Argentinita (Encarnacio\u0301n Lo\u0301pez), Jose\u0301 Greco, and Pilar Lo\u0301pez, as well as the troupes of Antonio and Rosario (Antonio Ruiz Soler and Rosario Florencia Pe\u0301rez Podilla) and Xime\u0301nez-Vargas (Roberto Xime\u0301nez and Manolo Vargas).",
              "Classically influenced flamenco artists Antonio Gades, Christina Hoyos, Jose\u0301 Greco II, and Lola Greco have also pushed the boundaries of flamenco.",
              "Gades in particular, in his collaborations with the filmmaker Carlos Saura, introduced flamenco to an international audience, demonstrating through his ingenious choreographic direction the dimensions of flamenco as an expandable performance art.",
              "Contemporary artists such as Eva la Yerbabuena, Joaqui\u0301n Corte\u0301s, Antonio Canales, Bele\u0301n Maya, and Juana Amaya are creating new rhythmic strategies in the studio and integrating them into longer narrative theatre pieces in which rhythm becomes the dominant element of the dance.",
              "In the last few decades of the 20th century, flamenco also was influenced by the general musical trend toward fusion of styles."

              "Baile, or dance, has been the dominant element of flamenco since that time, though it is never performed without accompaniment.",

              "During the convulsive period between the Restoration and the beginning of the civil war, from 1875 to 1936, these groups used flamenco to critique what they saw as Spain\u2019s political, economic, and cultural ills.",
              "The Catholic Church perceived flamenco as an offshoot of the sort of mass cultural entertainments that led to immodesty, the breakdown of the family, and the weakening of the Patria.",
              "But for many progressive intellectuals, by contrast, flamenco\u2014along with its twin scourge, bullfighting\u2014was thought to keep Spaniards in a stranglehold of backwardness.",
              "They saw the entertainment as a distraction that prevented Spaniards from solving the nation\u2019s numerous ills, including a corrupt political system, a wildly inadequate and unequal educational system, a lack of infrastructure and technological know-how, and vast inequalities of wealth.",
              "Meanwhile, for working-class reformers and revolutionaries, flamenco and its concomitant lifestyle exploited people\u2019s poverty and diverted workers away from becoming full actors in seeking revolution to end social, political, and economic inequality.",
              "In reality, all of these groups used flamenco as a vessel to contain their dissatisfaction with the ideological and structural changes that emerged out of the French and Industrial Revolutions.",
              "They railed in newspaper diatribes against this form of entertainment, with some critics seeing flamenco as the perverted outcome of increased secularization, while others thought it showed resistance to progress and modernization.",
              "What they were really complaining about, however, was the permeation of modern mass culture into the daily lives of everyday citizens.",
              "The many World\u2019s Fairs of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries gave flamenco a boost, making Spanish Gypsy performers all the rage, especially in Paris.",
              "Flamenco \u201cdeep song\u201d (cante jondo) received the blessings of European avant-garde artists such as Sergei Diaghilev and Claude Debussy, who had attended flamenco performances at the Paris World\u2019s Fairs of 1889 and 1900, and found it primal and authentic.",
              "That led Spanish intellectuals and artists such as Manuel de Falla and Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca to elevate this form of flamenco to \u201chigh culture.",
              "\u201d Thus, the support of Europeans outside Spain transformed the cultural meaning of flamenco for Spanish artists and intellectuals in much the same way that 20th-century European support for African-American jazz and blues aided their popularity in the United States.",
              "But after the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War, from 1936 to 1939, flamenco performances in Spain diminished considerably.",
              "The Catholic Church and leaders of the Seccio\u0301n Femenina (the female wing of Spain\u2019s Fascist Party) disavowed flamenco.",
              "To counteract its perceived evils, they promoted folk dancing and singing, encouraging a new kind of national identity predicated on Spanish regional diversity and cleansed of flamenco\u2019s torrid reputation.",
              "But by the 1950s, after years of international isolation, the Franco regime needed money.",
              "This led the regime to change course, promoting flamenco in order to jump-start Spain\u2019s tourist industry.",
              "A tourism promoter named Carlos Gonza\u0301lez Cuesta wrote, \u201cWe have to resign ourselves touristically to be a country of [Spanish stereotypes], because the day we lose the [Spanish stereotypes], we will have lost 90 percent of our attraction for tourists.",
              "\u201d So the Franco regime pandered to tourists\u2019 love of flamenco, increasing the number of clubs that specialized in it, advertising female flamenco dancers on tourism and airline brochures, encouraging professional flamenco performers to star in Hollywood films, and featuring performers in traveling exhibitions like the 1964-1965 New York World\u2019s Fair.",
              "These strategies worked;",
              "the regime was able to bring in millions of tourists and their money to help fund Spain\u2019s economic boom of the 1960s.",

              "The reason for flamenco\u2019s horrible reputation among Spanish elites during the 19th and 20th centuries was that historically, performances were associated with the ostracized Gypsy (Roma) population in Spain, and they took place in seedy urban areas.",
              "Spanish elites particularly despised how foreigners linked Spain with flamenco.",

              "But flamencomania proved much more difficult to eradicate than the so-called Black Legend: the negative propaganda, spread by Spain\u2019s French and British rivals, that characterized Spain as the land of cruel Inquisitors, sadistic colonial rulers, repressive politicians, and intellectual and artistic yokels.",
              "Flamenco came to encapsulate Spanish elites\u2019 feelings of shame about the country\u2019s declining status as a great power in the modern era.",
              "Flamenco\u2019s critics were divided into three main groups: the Catholic Church and its conservative allies, left-leaning intellectuals and politicians, and leaders from revolutionary workers\u2019 movements.",
              "During the convulsive period between the Restoration and the beginning of the civil war, from 1875 to 1936, these groups used flamenco to critique what they saw as Spain\u2019s political, economic, and cultural ills.",
              "The Catholic Church perceived flamenco as an offshoot of the sort of mass cultural entertainments that led to immodesty, the breakdown of the family, and the weakening of the Patria.",
              "But for many progressive intellectuals, by contrast, flamenco\u2014along with its twin scourge, bullfighting\u2014was thought to keep Spaniards in a stranglehold of backwardness.",
              "They saw the entertainment as a distraction that prevented Spaniards from solving the nation\u2019s numerous ills, including a corrupt political system, a wildly inadequate and unequal educational system, a lack of infrastructure and technological know-how, and vast inequalities of wealth.",
              "Meanwhile, for working-class reformers and revolutionaries, flamenco and its concomitant lifestyle exploited people\u2019s poverty and diverted workers away from becoming full actors in seeking revolution to end social, political, and economic inequality.",
              "In reality, all of these groups used flamenco as a vessel to contain their dissatisfaction with the ideological and structural changes that emerged out of the French and Industrial Revolutions.",
              "They railed in newspaper diatribes against this form of entertainment, with some critics seeing flamenco as the perverted outcome of increased secularization, while others thought it showed resistance to progress and modernization.",
              "What they were really complaining about, however, was the permeation of modern mass culture into the daily lives of everyday citizens.",
              "The many World\u2019s Fairs of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries gave flamenco a boost, making Spanish Gypsy performers all the rage, especially in Paris.",
              "Flamenco \u201cdeep song\u201d (cante jondo) received the blessings of European avant-garde artists such as Sergei Diaghilev and Claude Debussy, who had attended flamenco performances at the Paris World\u2019s Fairs of 1889 and 1900, and found it primal and authentic.",
              "That led Spanish intellectuals and artists such as Manuel de Falla and Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca to elevate this form of flamenco to \u201chigh culture.",
              "\u201d Thus, the support of Europeans outside Spain transformed the cultural meaning of flamenco for Spanish artists and intellectuals in much the same way that 20th-century European support for African-American jazz and blues aided their popularity in the United States.",
              "But after the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War, from 1936 to 1939, flamenco performances in Spain diminished considerably.",

              "To counteract its perceived evils, they promoted folk dancing and singing, encouraging a new kind of national identity predicated on Spanish regional diversity and cleansed of flamenco\u2019s torrid reputation.",
              "But by the 1950s, after years of international isolation, the Franco regime needed money.",
              "This led the regime to change course, promoting flamenco in order to jump-start Spain\u2019s tourist industry.",
              "A tourism promoter named Carlos Gonza\u0301lez Cuesta wrote, \u201cWe have to resign ourselves touristically to be a country of [Spanish stereotypes], because the day we lose the [Spanish stereotypes], we will have lost 90 percent of our attraction for tourists.",
              "\u201d So the Franco regime pandered to tourists\u2019 love of flamenco, increasing the number of clubs that specialized in it, advertising female flamenco dancers on tourism and airline brochures, encouraging professional flamenco performers to star in Hollywood films, and featuring performers in traveling exhibitions like the 1964-1965 New York World\u2019s Fair.",

              "In reality, all of these groups used flamenco as a vessel to contain their dissatisfaction with the ideological and structural changes that emerged out of the French and Industrial Revolutions.",
              "They railed in newspaper diatribes against this form of entertainment, with some critics seeing flamenco as the perverted outcome of increased secularization, while others thought it showed resistance to progress and modernization.",
              "What they were really complaining about, however, was the permeation of modern mass culture into the daily lives of everyday citizens.",

              "That led Spanish intellectuals and artists such as Manuel de Falla and Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca to elevate this form of flamenco to \u201chigh culture.",
              "\u201d Thus, the support of Europeans outside Spain transformed the cultural meaning of flamenco for Spanish artists and intellectuals in much the same way that 20th-century European support for African-American jazz and blues aided their popularity in the United States.",

              "But by the 1950s, after years of international isolation, the Franco regime needed money.",
              "This led the regime to change course, promoting flamenco in order to jump-start Spain\u2019s tourist industry.",

              "But the public spaces and social centers that play a major role in the formation of flamenco culture are increasingly threatened by gentrification, newly legislated municipal ordinances and heavy policing.",
              "On a rainy Friday this March in front of Seville\u2019s city hall, more than 50 people, most of them middle-aged, circled a man playing guitar, joining with accompanying hand-clapping, while women of all ages occasionally entered the circle and broke into dance.",
              "Although many of the tourists passing the square had mistaken the gathering for another street spectacle, this public Tertulia was in fact a political demonstration organized by members of the Pen\u0303a de los Torres Macarena, an association dedicated to the performance of flamenco in response to being shut down by the police for noise violations.",
              "Flamenco Pen\u0303as such as the Torres Macarena are a relatively new phenomena in the history of flamenco.",
              "These neighborhood associations of flamenco adherents popped up all around Andalusia as Spain transformed into a democracy in the \u201970s, and since then they have played a significant role in teaching the traditions of music and dance to younger generations, providing crucial space to rising artists and strengthening the social fabric of flamenco in a noncommercial way.",
              "Small Cultural Clubs for Preservation Although sometimes criticized by younger artists for being conservative and resistant to new styles, these small, voluntary clubs are more commonly viewed as indispensable for the preservation of flamenco culture.",
              "Located in the working-class neighborhood of Macarena for more than 40 years, the Pen\u0303a de los Torres Macarena is the oldest to exist in Seville and is praised by flamenco aficionados from all around the world for its open atmosphere.",
              "Its local and international fame notwithstanding, the Pen\u0303a was the target of constant complaints by a neighbor who moved to the vicinity a few years ago and who since then has frequently called the police because of the noise.",
              "Even expensive sound-blockers, paid for by the association, didn\u2019t stop his complaints.",
              "Although commercial venues can pay their way around the law, this was impossible for the Pen\u0303a.",
              "Now denied the right to assemble in their own space, members of the Pen\u0303a started a campaign to fight the decision of the police.",
              "They have called for numerous actions in front of the mayor\u2019s office, bringing their community\u2019s music and dance to the streets, in what is for many members their first political demonstration.",
              "Furthermore, with the help of younger activists, they have produced a YouTube clip featuring some of the most well-known flamenco artists, such as Israel Galvan, Cristina Hoyos and Ricardo Min\u0303o, among others, all protesting the closure of the Pen\u0303a.",
              "The story of the Pen\u0303a Torres Macarena is not an isolated one.",
              "As members of the federation of Pen\u0303as in Andalusia confirmed, many such associations were forced to close down in recent years due to newly passed municipal noise ordinances.",
              "A suggested readjustment for the law to exempt live and non-amplified shows played in non-commercial venues is still being tossed around between the regional government of Andalusia and the municipality of Seville, while more Pen\u0303as and other cultural centers are confronted with steep fines and police repression.",
              "This fight is especially difficult for some of the elderly Pen\u0303 -members who, since the worsening economic crisis, have found themselves struggling to make ends meet.",
              "Singing Prohibited (Photo: FLO6X8) Noise ordinances are not the only challenges put on non-commercial flamenco by the newly-enacted municipal laws.",
              "Passed with the declared aim to rid the streets of noise, criminality, alcoholism and prostitution, to make cities safer and more tourist-friendly, the very basic social interactions that enabled flamenco to exist in public space have come under scrutiny by the state.",
              "So, for example, the regulation against drinking alcohol in public has set out to destroy one of the most popular rituals of Spanish youth, known as the botellon: sitting with friends, chatting and playing music while sharing bottles of alcoholic beverages, usually bought in the nearest corner shop.",
              "Seen as highly hypocritical by many, this new regulation has led to fines and police violence against people simply sitting on a public bench in the street with a bottle of beer, while excluding bar patrons who are taking over the very same public spaces (often privatized for sole usage of such establishments).",
              "Nowadays, several years after the enforcement of this regulation, it is still common to see such gatherings of youngsters and anyone else who lacks money to drink in a bar (of which there are many since the crisis).",
              "Yet fear of the police and the need to not bring attention to oneself have made such gatherings less lively and much less musical.",
              "Consider other recent regulations against street musicians, for example, empowering cops to confiscate musical instruments and levy aggressive fines for playing or even just singing in public, and one can begin to appreciate the rising concern that the squares of Andalusian cities are gradually losing their musical vitality.",
              "A Twisted History The actions of the local government and municipalities toward flamenco, promoting professional artists and institutions and using it as a tourist attraction, all the while suppressing its local and non-commercial variations, is especially cynical considering the origins of flamenco as a cultural expression of the racially marginalized and the poor.",
              "This fact is still evident in the content and style of its songs, which typically express the hardness and violence of life in poverty, especially associated with the Gitanos \u2013 the Romani people of Spain.",
              "Yet the split between communal and commercial flamenco and its ironic twists have actually existed ever since the genre rose to fame in the 19th century, as aristocrats and tourists paid Gitanos to perform their deep songs and exotic dances.",
              "Later, Cafe\u0301 Cantante, Flamenco Operas and Tablaos presented flamenco aesthetics to middle-class audiences all around Spain, while still claiming popular and \u201cgypsy\u201d authenticity, which many have disputed.",
              "Under the Franco regime, flamenco gained the status of a Spanish national symbol, while secret police simultaneously repressed any form of cultural dissent in lower-class neighborhoods, illegalizing many flamenco concerts and gatherings.",
              "And through the rise of tourism (which included the marketing of flamenco) and its impact on inner-city real estate prices, Gitano communities were expelled and thrown out of their houses and neighborhoods all over Andalusia.",
              "The most famous example of such policies is the neighborhood of Triana, which lies on the opposite side of the river from Seville.",
              "It is still touted in many tourist books as a \u201cBarrio Gitano,\u201d while most visitors are unaware that the majority of the area\u2019s indigenous Gitano community was forcibly kicked out without compensation in the beginning of the 1970s, in a brutal eviction campaign that led to the disappearance of a vast musical tradition.",
              "Unaware of that loss, tourists now walk through the picturesque allies to the river and gain easier access to the authenticity of the neighborhood by paying entry to packed flamenco bars serving expensive drinks.",
              "Nevertheless, the story of flamenco is much more than just its appropriation and commercialization.",
              "Some claim it is exactly out of this contradictory position that it could have survived and developed, even though Spanish society has radically changed since it first appeared.",
              "Commercial and professional expressions of flamenco have fed back into its communal practices and vice versa, and both would have been unimaginable today without the other.",
              "But sadly, exactly the richness of praxis and spaces that evoked so many conflicting meanings of this art are now under attack by the laws of the state, which criminalize dissent and persecute non-consumerist ways of living in the midst of an economic crisis.",
              "As this dialectical process is being shaken out of balance by the politics of social and cultural repression, flamenco also rediscovered its fighting spirit as part of the rise of a popular anticapitalist movement throughout Spain in the last couple of years.",
              "Resisting Bodies (Photo: FLO6X8) Most notable are the actions of the group Flo6x8, an activist collective that decided to use the language of flamenco in political protests.",
              "The members of the collective, many of them professional flamenco artists, dance, sing and play inside financial institutions like banks, which symbolize the highly corrupted crisis management in Spain.",
              "Documenting themselves entering banks around Seville while breaking into song and dance, the group has reached millions of viewers in YouTube and received national and international media coverage.",
              "An anti-protest law, passed just a few days ago in the Spanish parliament with the aim to criminalize most protest forms associated with the Indignados popular protest movement, will additionally threaten the continuation of Flo6x8 activities with fines reaching more than $40,000.",
              "Changing the words of known bulerias, fandangos and tangos to decry the crimes of the financial elite, these artists might mock the bankers;",
              "but at the same time, they take their political performances very seriously and consider themselves a part of a long tradition of flamenco condemning injustice and prejudice.",
              "Challenging the normative spatiality of flamenco by occupying the lobbies of banks or even the building of the local parliament, they also defy the legal and financial frames into which neoliberalism attempts to confine artistic expression.",
              "Although their actions might irritate conservative flamenco aficionados, who vow to keep the true art of flamenco outside of the realms of politics, they have aroused interest in flamenco among younger political activists alienated from its old-fashioned and conservative aura.",
              "By putting flamenco to clear political use, they have transformed not only protest forms, but also flamenco itself, adding a new audacious and revolutionary form of expression to its multilayered manifestations.",
              "Their actions give hope for the survival of flamenco as a popular art that finds its way to the daily lives of a generation of young Andalusians.",
              "Against the processes of artistic commercialization and gentrification, their performances seem to declare the known lines of Federico Garcia Lorca\u2019s poem: The weeping of the guitar begins.",

              "A pop sensation credited with revolutionizing flamenco, the singer known simply as Rosali\u0301a had been steadily gaining traction for a few years when her smash hit, \u201cMalamente\u201d (\u201cBadly\u201d), released in May this year, shot her to stardom.",
              "A masterful fusion of flamenco, trap and R&B, the song's accompanying music video is a Beyonce\u0301-like, high-production affair that puts a modern, and urban, spin on the age-old genre.",
              "In one shot, Rosali\u0301a circles a bullfighter on a motorcycle, alternately glaring and smiling coyly at her prey.",
              "Was it a contemporary, feminist reclaiming of a traditionally masculine trope?",
              "If there was any doubt as to her feminist messaging, the second hit she dropped in July, \u201cPienso en tu mira\u0301\u201d (\u201cI think of your gaze\u201d), made it clear.",
              "\u201cRosali\u0301a launches an attack against macho violence and breaks the internet,\u201d one local outlet said.",
              "When \u201cEl Mal Querer\u201d was released Nov.",
              "2, it was lauded as a feminist concept album.",
              "Each song in it is a chapter in a larger story about a woman escaping the shackles of a jealous, abusive lover, culminating with the freedom anthem, \u201cA ningu\u0301n hombre\u201d (\u201cTo no man.",
              "\u201d) But to many members of Spain\u2019s Roma community, Rosali\u0301a\u2019s success and labeling as a feminist icon are beside the point, if not altogether vexing.",
              "\u201cIf you stick feminist slogans in your songs but then contribute to the oppression of other women through your actions and capitalist practices, that\u2019s not being a feminist, that\u2019s being a poseur,\u201d the Association of Feminist Gitanas for Diversity said in an email to The World.",
              "Throughout her rise to fame, Rosali\u0301a has been mired in a debate over her supposed appropriation of an art form with gitano origins.",
              "The 25-year-old star is not gitana, nor is she from Andalusia, the birthplace of flamenco.",
              "She\u2019s from Catalonia, the northern Spanish region now famous for its independence bid last year.",
              "She\u2019s been accused of capitalizing on southern, gitano culture \u2014 for adopting an Andalusian accent, sprinkling Calo\u0301 (the Spanish Romani language) into her songs, dressing like a gitana and using Roma imagery in her music videos.",
              "Related: Why some Catalans say independence is a 'feminist struggle' There are two ways of seeing this: Either Rosali\u0301a can\u2019t get a break, or the whole debacle is evidence of an extremely marginalized community\u2019s anger at having its symbols and tropes launch an \u201coutsider\u2019s\u201d career.",
              "The Rosali\u0301a appropriation debate is a look into the murky intersection of feminism and cultural hegemony in Spain and, more broadly, in the music industry.",
              "Along with many other members of Spain\u2019s Roma community, the Feminist Gitanas association is irked by what it sees as Rosali\u0301a\u2019s refusal to credit gitanos for their \u201cfundamental contribution\u201d to flamenco as a genre.",
              "In a July interview with Spanish newspaper El Mundo, Rosali\u0301a responded to appropriation allegations by saying that \u201cflamenco does not belong to the Gypsies.",
              "\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for copyright, but recognition,\u201d the association said.",
              "There are several theories out there, but most agree that flamenco originated as a mix of Moorish, Jewish and Roma folkloric musical traditions.",
              "Today, the genre is intrinsically tied to Andalusia and the Roma community.",
              "The music, a mournful exultation you can hear in raspy, belted vocals, tells of the Romani people\u2019s repression and persecution through the ages, from extermination campaigns to repressive laws designed to stamp out their culture (the last overtly anti-Roma laws were only repealed in 1978 in Spain).",
              "Related: Barcelona\u2019s mayor is on a quest to 'feminize' politics amid independence debate Rosali\u0301a detractors claim that the Catalan artist\u2019s global success is proof of the Roma\u2019s continued marginalization across all industries.",
              "\u201cFlamenco is suffering a kind of institutional racism that whitewashes the art form and markets it like a piece of meat wrapped up in plastic,\u201d leading gitana activist Noelia Corte\u0301s said.",
              "Corte\u0301s and the association contend that a strong current of anti-gypsyism in Spain has long barred Roma artists from the kind of success a woman like Rosali\u0301a can enjoy.",
              "According to the EU\u2019s Agency for Fundamental Rights, 98 percent of Romani in Spain live in poverty.",
              "Unemployment hovers around 36 percent, according to the Gitano Secretarial Foundation \u2014 a number disproportionately higher than other ethnic groups in Spain.",
              "\u201cRosali\u0301a has unprecedented support from the music industry, which has made her popular thanks to well-planned marketing campaigns,\u201d the association added.",
              "\u201cThis is nothing more than the demonstration of white privilege.",
              "\u201d But as others have pointed out, these kinds of attacks run the risk of airing sexist sentiments.",
              "One Twitter user wrote, \u201cWhy is that every time a woman triumphs people think [her success] is at the hands of someone else, as if she were a useless doll?",
              "\u201d \u201cRosali\u0301a is an artist who knows what she wants and who works hard to achieve that,\u201d music critic Vi\u0301ctor Lenore said.",
              "She studied flamenco under the tutelage of a local flamenco fixture for eight grueling years before launching her first album, \u201cLos Angeles,\u201d in 2017;",
              "and she writes, composes and produces her work.",
              "Related: Inside the Catalan feminist plan to upend Spanish patriarchal rule Though Lenore dismisses the appropriation charge \u2014 some flamenco greats like Paco de Luci\u0301a weren\u2019t Roma either, he says \u2014 he concedes that the press only ever pays heed to \u201cfashionable [gypsies].",
              "\u201d \u201cHaving a good stylist is more important than having a good repertoire.",

              "Inside Spain, however, the relationship between the flamenco art form and Spanish national identity has been fraught for more than a century.",
              "Indeed, the world\u2019s love of flamenco has long created problems within Spain, where the performance was once considered a vulgar and pornographic spectacle.",
              "Over the years, many Spaniards considered flamenco a scourge of their nation, deploring it as an entertainment that lulled the masses into stupefaction and hampered Spain\u2019s progress toward modernity.",

              "Flamenco, which UNESCO recently recognized as part of the World\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage, is a complex art form incorporating poetry, singing (cante), guitar playing (toque), dance (baile), polyrhythmic hand-clapping (palmas), and finger snapping (pitos).",

              "Moreover, from the mid-nineteenth century on, flamenco entertainment spread quickly from southern Spain to the capital (Madrid) and onward to other Spanish urban centers, flourishing there as a consequence of the rise of a mass urban culture and increased foreign tourism.",
              "The reason for flamenco\u2019s horrible reputation among Spanish elites during the 19th and 20th centuries was that historically, performances were associated with the ostracized Gypsy (Roma) population in Spain, and they took place in seedy urban areas.",
              "Spanish elites particularly despised how foreigners linked Spain with flamenco.",
              "Spain\u2019s national identity had previously been defined by outsiders who tied the country to Inquisitors, beggars, bandits, bullfighters, Gypsies, and flamenco dancers.",
              "Usually foreigners imposed the flamenco identity onto Spain as a backhanded compliment to highlight Spain\u2019s steadfast authenticity.",
              "The nation had not fallen prey to the soul-sucking effects of industrialization.",
              "But with very few exceptions, Spanish elites and social reformers never liked\u2014nor wanted\u2014this art form to represent themselves or their nation, and they fought flamenco fever with all the resources they could muster.",
              "But flamencomania proved much more difficult to eradicate than the so-called Black Legend: the negative propaganda, spread by Spain\u2019s French and British rivals, that characterized Spain as the land of cruel Inquisitors, sadistic colonial rulers, repressive politicians, and intellectual and artistic yokels.",
              "Flamenco came to encapsulate Spanish elites\u2019 feelings of shame about the country\u2019s declining status as a great power in the modern era.",
              "Flamenco\u2019s critics were divided into three main groups: the Catholic Church and its conservative allies, left-leaning intellectuals and politicians, and leaders from revolutionary workers\u2019 movements.",
              "During the convulsive period between the Restoration and the beginning of the civil war, from 1875 to 1936, these groups used flamenco to critique what they saw as Spain\u2019s political, economic, and cultural ills.",
              "The Catholic Church perceived flamenco as an offshoot of the sort of mass cultural entertainments that led to immodesty, the breakdown of the family, and the weakening of the Patria.",
              "But for many progressive intellectuals, by contrast, flamenco\u2014along with its twin scourge, bullfighting\u2014was thought to keep Spaniards in a stranglehold of backwardness.",
              "They saw the entertainment as a distraction that prevented Spaniards from solving the nation\u2019s numerous ills, including a corrupt political system, a wildly inadequate and unequal educational system, a lack of infrastructure and technological know-how, and vast inequalities of wealth.",
              "Meanwhile, for working-class reformers and revolutionaries, flamenco and its concomitant lifestyle exploited people\u2019s poverty and diverted workers away from becoming full actors in seeking revolution to end social, political, and economic inequality.",
              "In reality, all of these groups used flamenco as a vessel to contain their dissatisfaction with the ideological and structural changes that emerged out of the French and Industrial Revolutions.",
              "They railed in newspaper diatribes against this form of entertainment, with some critics seeing flamenco as the perverted outcome of increased secularization, while others thought it showed resistance to progress and modernization.",
              "What they were really complaining about, however, was the permeation of modern mass culture into the daily lives of everyday citizens.",
              "The many World\u2019s Fairs of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries gave flamenco a boost, making Spanish Gypsy performers all the rage, especially in Paris.",
              "Flamenco \u201cdeep song\u201d (cante jondo) received the blessings of European avant-garde artists such as Sergei Diaghilev and Claude Debussy, who had attended flamenco performances at the Paris World\u2019s Fairs of 1889 and 1900, and found it primal and authentic.",
              "That led Spanish intellectuals and artists such as Manuel de Falla and Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca to elevate this form of flamenco to \u201chigh culture.",
              "\u201d Thus, the support of Europeans outside Spain transformed the cultural meaning of flamenco for Spanish artists and intellectuals in much the same way that 20th-century European support for African-American jazz and blues aided their popularity in the United States.",
              "But after the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War, from 1936 to 1939, flamenco performances in Spain diminished considerably.",
              "The Catholic Church and leaders of the Seccio\u0301n Femenina (the female wing of Spain\u2019s Fascist Party) disavowed flamenco.",
              "To counteract its perceived evils, they promoted folk dancing and singing, encouraging a new kind of national identity predicated on Spanish regional diversity and cleansed of flamenco\u2019s torrid reputation.",
              "But by the 1950s, after years of international isolation, the Franco regime needed money.",
              "This led the regime to change course, promoting flamenco in order to jump-start Spain\u2019s tourist industry.",
              "A tourism promoter named Carlos Gonza\u0301lez Cuesta wrote, \u201cWe have to resign ourselves touristically to be a country of [Spanish stereotypes], because the day we lose the [Spanish stereotypes], we will have lost 90 percent of our attraction for tourists.",
              "\u201d So the Franco regime pandered to tourists\u2019 love of flamenco, increasing the number of clubs that specialized in it, advertising female flamenco dancers on tourism and airline brochures, encouraging professional flamenco performers to star in Hollywood films, and featuring performers in traveling exhibitions like the 1964-1965 New York World\u2019s Fair.",
              "These strategies worked;",
              "the regime was able to bring in millions of tourists and their money to help fund Spain\u2019s economic boom of the 1960s.",

              "How much is known about the early development of the dance style?",
              "Well, those are hotly debated questions!",
              "The answer often depends on a person\u2019s political positions on race, regionalism, and nationalism within Spain.",
              "Some like to trace flamenco\u2019s origins to the early medieval Al Andalus period, when Muslim cultural influences were strongest.",
              "Others trace it to the arrival of gitanos (Gypsies) in Spain after 1447.",

              "Contemporary scholars such as I, however, see the origins of flamenco in the late 18th century, even though its influences are tracible to earlier eras.",
              "The song and dance forms we recognize as flamenco consolidated in the 19th century.",
              "In other words, it is a modern phenomenon that paralleled the rise of other 19th-century forms of mass culture like music halls and cabarets.",
              "The answer to your second question is much like the first.",
              "There seems to be some consensus that the dance styles known as baile flamenco were nurtured in bars, taverns, and dance academies in southern Spain\u2014Andalusia and Murcia\u2014during the late-18th and early-19th centuries.",
              "The dances, like the songs, emerged out of a hybrid of gitano and non-gitano Andalusian dances, and dances that came from continental Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean and, later, from African American dance forms. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, powerful groups from various places on the sociopolitical spectrum, including the Catholic Church, leftist intellectuals, and leading advocates of the working-class, all had complaints against flamenco as a low form of entertainment and as a negative image of Spain.",
              "If so many elites were against it, who did claim flamenco at this time?",
              "Everybody else?",
              "The elites you mentioned certainly fought against the growth of cafe\u0301s cantantes, the venues where one could most readily watch a flamenco performance, because they viewed these places as dens of iniquity from which all sorts of pornographic horrors emerged.",
              "They also resented the ways foreigners were elevating flamenco as a symbol of Spanish national identity.",
              "Flamenco performances were extremely popular, so much so, that in the early 20th century, some performers could command stadium (bullfighting ring) audiences.",
              "Some of the 19th- and 20th-century debates over the ill effects of flamenco sound very familiar to us today when some citizens complain that a city wants to tax its residents to build a giant sports stadium but does not have the political will to fight for school funding.",

              "They began a campaign to preserve and promote Catalan literature, music, dance, etc.",
              "But there had already been a great deal of migration from Andalusia to Catalonia in this period because Catalonia was then at the forefront of industrialization.",
              "So, the music came with this migration.",
              "Children of these immigrants, like the amazing flamenco dancer Carmen Amaya, were born and raised in Catalonia.",
              "They saw Catalonia as their home and still maintained their cultural ties to the ethnic gitano communities.",
              "In many ways, as I argue in my book, flamenco remained extremely popular, at least until the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939, despite the Catalan nationalists\u2019 backlash against it.",
              "I would say that it was not necessarily Andalusian regional identity that contributed to Spain\u2019s as a flamenco nation, so much as it was foreigners\u2019 conflation of Andalusia with Spain.",
              "This conflation really began in the early 19th century when foreign visitors\u2014mostly writers\u2014visited southern Spain and wrote about their experiences in travel narratives and, later, guidebooks.",

              "These foreign tourists took their requisite tours of the cafe\u0301s cantantes and then wrote about them through their own colonial gazes.",
              "They publicized and repeated these stereotypes to larger audiences outside of Spain until everybody assumed that Andalusia, bullfighting, and flamenco were the quintessence of Spain.",
              "Most Andalusian nationalists themselves did not view flamenco as part of Spain\u2019s national identity, with the rare exception of people like Blas Infante, the person deemed \u201cthe father of Andalusian nationalism\u201d and the writer of the Andalusian national anthem.",

              "Folklore is usually associated with rural societies, and flamenco performances were really mostly urban phenomena.",
              "One of the reasons there was a constant backlash against flamenco was because moralists viewed urban life as inherently corrupt.",
              "So, once the Franco regime came into power in 1939, many conservative groups attempted to impose what they perceived to be rural cultural values on Spaniards.",
              "To that end, the women\u2019s section of Spain\u2019s fascist party, the Seccio\u0301n Femenina, began organizing song and dance troupes known as the Coros y Danzas de Espan\u0303a.",
              "They established these troupes to showcase the diversity of regional songs and dances throughout Spain.",
              "These groups traveled throughout Spain and, later, throughout the world, competing in international folklore contests.",
              "One of the Coros y Danzas\u2019 stated aims was to tell the world that Spain contained wonderful musical diversity and that it should not be defined as the land of flamenco dancers.",
              "So, one can see this strong push toward folklore performances as an attempt to quell the idea of Spain as the flamenco nation.",

              "Like any art form, even commercial ones, flamenco can be used as a form of social protest.",
              "One of my favorite examples of this form of protest came out of the global economic recession that began in 2008, which hit Spain\u2014and Andalusia, especially\u2014hard.",

              "Moreover, from the mid-nineteenth century on, flamenco entertainment spread quickly from southern Spain to the capital (Madrid) and onward to other Spanish urban centers, flourishing there as a consequence of the rise of a mass urban culture and increased foreign tourism.",
              "The reason for flamenco\u2019s horrible reputation among Spanish elites during the 19th and 20th centuries was that historically, performances were associated with the ostracized Gypsy (Roma) population in Spain, and they took place in seedy urban areas.",
              "Spanish elites particularly despised how foreigners linked Spain with flamenco.",
              "Spain\u2019s national identity had previously been defined by outsiders who tied the country to Inquisitors, beggars, bandits, bullfighters, Gypsies, and flamenco dancers.",

              "But with very few exceptions, Spanish elites and social reformers never liked\u2014nor wanted\u2014this art form to represent themselves or their nation, and they fought flamenco fever with all the resources they could muster.",
              "But flamencomania proved much more difficult to eradicate than the so-called Black Legend: the negative propaganda, spread by Spain\u2019s French and British rivals, that characterized Spain as the land of cruel Inquisitors, sadistic colonial rulers, repressive politicians, and intellectual and artistic yokels.",
              "Flamenco came to encapsulate Spanish elites\u2019 feelings of shame about the country\u2019s declining status as a great power in the modern era.",
              "Flamenco\u2019s critics were divided into three main groups: the Catholic Church and its conservative allies, left-leaning intellectuals and politicians, and leaders from revolutionary workers\u2019 movements.",
              "During the convulsive period between the Restoration and the beginning of the civil war, from 1875 to 1936, these groups used flamenco to critique what they saw as Spain\u2019s political, economic, and cultural ills.",
              "The Catholic Church perceived flamenco as an offshoot of the sort of mass cultural entertainments that led to immodesty, the breakdown of the family, and the weakening of the Patria.",
              "But for many progressive intellectuals, by contrast, flamenco\u2014along with its twin scourge, bullfighting\u2014was thought to keep Spaniards in a stranglehold of backwardness.",
              "They saw the entertainment as a distraction that prevented Spaniards from solving the nation\u2019s numerous ills, including a corrupt political system, a wildly inadequate and unequal educational system, a lack of infrastructure and technological know-how, and vast inequalities of wealth.",
              "Meanwhile, for working-class reformers and revolutionaries, flamenco and its concomitant lifestyle exploited people\u2019s poverty and diverted workers away from becoming full actors in seeking revolution to end social, political, and economic inequality.",
              "In reality, all of these groups used flamenco as a vessel to contain their dissatisfaction with the ideological and structural changes that emerged out of the French and Industrial Revolutions.",
              "They railed in newspaper diatribes against this form of entertainment, with some critics seeing flamenco as the perverted outcome of increased secularization, while others thought it showed resistance to progress and modernization.",
              "What they were really complaining about, however, was the permeation of modern mass culture into the daily lives of everyday citizens.",
              "The many World\u2019s Fairs of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries gave flamenco a boost, making Spanish Gypsy performers all the rage, especially in Paris.",

              "That led Spanish intellectuals and artists such as Manuel de Falla and Federico Garci\u0301a Lorca to elevate this form of flamenco to \u201chigh culture.",
              "\u201d Thus, the support of Europeans outside Spain transformed the cultural meaning of flamenco for Spanish artists and intellectuals in much the same way that 20th-century European support for African-American jazz and blues aided their popularity in the United States.",

              "To counteract its perceived evils, they promoted folk dancing and singing, encouraging a new kind of national identity predicated on Spanish regional diversity and cleansed of flamenco\u2019s torrid reputation.",
              "But by the 1950s, after years of international isolation, the Franco regime needed money.",
              "This led the regime to change course, promoting flamenco in order to jump-start Spain\u2019s tourist industry.",

              "\u201d So the Franco regime pandered to tourists\u2019 love of flamenco, increasing the number of clubs that specialized in it, advertising female flamenco dancers on tourism and airline brochures, encouraging professional flamenco performers to star in Hollywood films, and featuring performers in traveling exhibitions like the 1964-1965 New York World\u2019s Fair.",

              "1Sandie Holgui\u0301n\u2019s monograph Flamenco Nation.",
              "The Construction of Spanish National Identity is a comprehensive study of how flamenco was inscribed into Spanish national identity and became one of the central cultural tropes associated with Spain for travellers and tourists, as well as for institutions and citizens at home.",
              "For readers interested in understanding why flamenco is still successfully used to lure numerous tourists first into Spain and thereafter into innumerable tablaos, pen\u0303as and chiringuitos across the country\u2019s cities and coastlines, this book will provide them with the historical background needed to answer that question.",
              "2Divided into three parts and seven chapters, Flamenco Nation is a historiography that studies representations of flamenco in travel narratives, guidebooks, essays, newspaper articles and campaign materials created by non-practitioners of the art form itself.",
              "In this way, Holgui\u0301n focusses on how the role of flamenco has evolved in historical debates about nationhood, from the late 19th century (Restoration Spain) until the end of the Franco-dictatorship in 1975, arguing that there was a fundamental change in conceptions of flamenco.",
              "Firstly, travel narratives and intellectual discourses that circulated in Spain and abroad in the 19th century shared the view that flamenco was a degenerate culture.",
              "Marginalised Gitano-communities, historically associated with the emergence of flamenco song and dance, provided foreign travellers with seductive tokens of Spain\u2019s so-called cultural \u2018backwardness\u2019.",
              "At later historical stages, while still operating as a symbol of traditional and exotic culture, flamenco was realigned with discourses of economic progress and successfully incorporated into a transnational tourism industry.",
              "3An important conceptual contribution from Holgui\u0301n\u2019s book is that it highlights the transnational dynamics that were operative at different stages of Spain\u2019s identity formation.",
              "The author shows, for example, that Romantic travellers from Britain, France and the United States made essential contributions to that process, alongside Spanish elites who wrote about the outlaw character of flamenco because they repudiated it (Chapters 1 and 2).",
              "Later, Holgui\u0301n goes on to illustrate how a campaign for a Spanish art exhibition in London associated Spain exclusively with flamenco and other folkloric tropes, thereby disregarding the domestic campaigns for the same event that emphasised the country\u2019s cultural diversity (Chapter 7).",
              "All of this helps the reader understand how processes of identity formation, in terms of both their construction and reception, can be multidirectional and eminently transnational efforts.",
              "4The first part of Flamenco Nation provides an informative overview of the emergence of flamenco in the 19th century and the historical processes that shaped Spain and Europe between the French Revolution and Restoration period.",
              "Helpful visual support is offered throughout with a series of maps that reconstruct the locations of cafe\u0301s cantantes in places such as Madrid, Seville and Barcelona.",
              "Chapter 1 examines the forging of inter-class alliances around the culture of majismo, a set of proto-nationalist tastes and demeanours that emerged in Madrid as a way to oppose the cultural, intellectual and political influences from France.",
              "Among other things, this illuminating chapter lays bare the historical conditions that made Andalusia, in opposition to other parts of Spain, a preferred destination for European travellers.",
              "Chapter 2 deals with elite groups who used their writing to agitate against flamenco.",
              "Representatives of the Catholic Church, progressive intellectuals and leaders of workers\u2019 movements all criticised flamenco, out of dissatisfaction with the social changes brought about by industrialisation and with the fact that mass culture was starting to influence the lives of Spanish citizens.",
              "5The second part, comprised of chapters 3, 4 and 5, discusses the roles of flamenco in projections of regional and national identity in the 19th and early-20th centuries.",
              "It starts with a brief theoretical discussion of the concepts of \u201cregional nationalism\u201d and \u201ccultural regionalism\u201d, which are then applied to the cases of Catalonia (Chapter 3) and Andalusia (Chapter 4).",
              "In line with the broad overviews of historical periods that Holgui\u0301n offers at the beginning of other chapters, the first part of chapter 3 reads as a cultural history of Catalan nationalism and deals with flamenco not so much because it was productive for the emergence of regional nationalism in Catalonia \u2014as were, for instance, the choral societies or orfeo\u0301ns that recuperated and performed traditional Catalan music (p.",
              "108-109)\u2014, but rather because nationalists rejected it.",
              "The second part of the chapter, however, does demonstrate that flamenco remained popular in spite of these manifestations of antiflamenquismo, and that Barcelona maintained \u201can ambivalent and sometimes humorously resigned connection to flamenco\u201d (p.",
              "114).",
              "6Chapter 4 analyses the roles of flamenco in Andalusian nationalism by honing in on the writings of Blas Infante, who is now officially acclaimed as the father of Andalusian nationalism and who envisioned a libertarian politics for Andalusia that was rooted in the history of flamenco.",
              "For instance, by deriving the etymology of the word \u201cflamenco\u201d from the Arabic felamengu (\u2018errant, fugitive labourer\u2019), Infante reinterpreted individualism in flamenco performances as a form of libertarianism, based on individual freedom and opposed, thereby, to the totalising tendencies of mass culture in northern Europe.",
              "Chapter 5 goes on to explore the dynamics between Spanish and European culture at various World Expositions, most of them located in Paris, in the late 19th century and pre-Civil War years.",
              "The Orientalist tropes used at these exhibitions were detested by the elites, who wished to find more realistic projections for Spanish national identity.",
              "7The third and final part of the book traces a series of shifting attitudes towards flamenco in the 20th century.",
              "Chapter 6 explores how religious institutions and groups like Accio\u0301n Cato\u0301lica under Primo de Rivera, the Second Republic and the first half of the Franco-dictatorship fought against the \u201ctide of modernity\u201d (p.",
              "180), thus contributing to the marginalisation of flamenco through a combination of propaganda, terror and repression.",
              "As shown in Chapter 7, flamenco became a renewed source for national pride in the second half of the dictatorship, a time in which Spaniards \u201ccolonized themselves for material gain\u201d (p.",
              "205) through folkloric dance spectacles and tourism campaigns.",
              "8As in earlier parts of the book, Holgui\u0301n\u2019s examination of attitudes toward flamenco under Franco considers a series of conservative discourses and opinions that apply not exclusively to flamenco and that are concerned more generally with the potential dangers of mass culture.",
              "By inferring conclusions about flamenco from this wider set of material, Holgui\u0301n does not always succeed in making a convincing translation from that broader context to specific attitudes towards flamenco.",
              "Part of the issue here may be that in most of the sources that Holgui\u0301n examines throughout Flamenco Nation, flamenco has already been converted into a stereotype;",
              "a reified and rather simplistic metaphor that is meant to represent either positive or negative aspects of Spanish national identity.",
              "Perhaps the author could have taken account of more specific sources on the art form that would have allowed for a stronger contextualisation of the diverse performative styles and practices of flamenco, as well as of the meanings they acquired for specific individuals and communities.",
              "Possible sources that come to mind here are written memoirs by flamenco singers Antonio Mairena and Pepe el de la Matrona, which document the way in which flamencos lived together with the Francoist military in Seville during the Civil War and post-war years.",
              "There were other prominent regime representatives, such as Jose\u0301 Carlos de Luna and Jose\u0301 Mari\u0301a Pema\u0301n, who were dedicated folklorists and flamenco aficionados.",
              "These and other links between the worlds of flamenco and the Primo de Rivera and Franco dictatorships could help shed a clearer light on how flamenco was alternatively repressed, appropriated and admired by authoritarian rulers in Spain\u2019s recent history.",
              "9Flamenco Nation stops in 1975, the year of Franco\u2019s death.",
              "An obvious question, then, is how flamenco became relevant for processes of nation-building during Spain\u2019s complex transition to democracy.",
              "As Holgui\u0301n states, this topic would require another book (p.",
              "243-244).",
              "Yet, in the Coda she does outline a few suggestions for what that book might be about.",
              "After describing how the Spanish state and its cultural institutions have continued to use flamenco to attract tourists and promote a coherent notion of Spanish identity \u2014at times at the expense of communities and lesser-known practitioners of the art form\u2014 Holgui\u0301n concludes Flamenco Nation with a consideration of how flamenco can, \u201cwhen given the right set of circumstances, bear witness to human suffering\u201d (p.",
              "257).",
              "With this in mind, she briefly analyses recent uses of flamenco by activists in Seville: a dance performance carried out on the International Women\u2019s Day for Peace and Disarmament in 2013 to protest against the repression of women by the notorious Francoist general Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, and a flash mob performance by the artivist collective Flo6x8.",
              "10Thus shifting her focus from written and printed sources towards a selection of actual performances, Holgui\u0301n finishes her book, quite unexpectedly, with a discussion of the specific circumstances under which flamenco could achieve a critical potential, an analytical approach that could have been productive at earlier stages of the analysis.",
              "Chapter 4, while offering a generally insightful reading of Infante\u2019s texts, could perhaps have made a stronger effort to show how Infante mobilised his ideas about flamenco and libertarianism in speeches and gatherings, how those ideas circulated and to what extent they left an imprint on other Spanish intellectuals.",
              "11At any rate, the legacy of the folklorist discourses and stereotypes studied by Holgui\u0301n poses relevant questions for future scholarship on flamenco.",
              "How do propagandistic uses of flamenco under Franco still have an impact on the attraction that the art form can (or cannot) exert on younger generations?",
              "How have centrifugal tendencies and struggles for independence in the contemporary political climate, exacerbated by state arrogance and repression in recent years, turned flamenco into a negative stereotype, perhaps in a way that resembles previous forms of antiflamenquismo?",
              "Such questions, of course, reach beyond the scope of Flamenco Nation.",
              "As a work of historiography, it is mainly concerned with situating the evolution of flamenco \u201cwithin the larger Spanish and European historical, cultural, and political trends of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\u201d (p.",
              "8).",
              "Nevertheless, writing a book about flamenco today means that one needs to respond, in one way or another, to the fact that flamenco does not loom as powerfully as before in what Holgui\u0301n calls \u201cthe Spanish imaginary\u201d (p.",
              "8).",
              "Scholars, apart from documenting historical developments that have shaped flamenco and other cultural forms, have a privileged position to find new ways of thinking about flamenco beyond national stereotypes.",
              "In particular, they can help rethink the connections between art, identity and community so as to pave the way for the emergence of postnational imaginaries.",
              "12Holgui\u0301n\u2019s book is a welcome contribution to flamenco scholarship since it delineates a genealogy of previous attempts \u2014most importantly, by Spanish elites and reformers\u2014 to \u201ccleanse what they perceived to be the flamenco stain from Spain\u201d (p.",
              "15).",
              "In a sense, their project was doomed, given that cultural stereotypes are highly resilient.",
              "It remains to be seen how this inconvenient stereotype will continue to inform contemporary debates about identity and nationhood in Spain and beyond.",
