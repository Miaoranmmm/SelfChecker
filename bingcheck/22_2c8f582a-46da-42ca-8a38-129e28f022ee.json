    "query": "What was the most challenging obstacle that John F. Kennedy faced during his presidency, and what action did he take to overcome it?",
    "response": "One of the most challenging obstacles that John F. Kennedy faced during his presidency was the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. This was a tense confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union over the deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles off the coast of Florida[^7^]. Kennedy learned about the Soviet missile sites from a secret U-2 spy plane photograph on October 16, 1962[^5^] [^8^]. He met in secret with his advisors for several days to discuss the problem and weigh the options[^5^] [^9^]. He was originally advised to carry out an air strike on Cuba followed by an invasion, but he rejected this option as too risky and likely to trigger a nuclear war[^9^]. Instead, he decided to place a naval blockade around Cuba and demand the removal of the missiles and the destruction of the sites[^5^]. He also secretly agreed to remove US nuclear missiles from Turkey in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba[^5^]. He announced his decision to the nation and the world in a televised address on October 22, 1962[^5^]. The crisis lasted for 13 days until Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev publicly agreed to Kennedy's terms on October 28, 1962[^5^]. The crisis was averted, but it was a close call that could have resulted in a nuclear war. Kennedy's action was widely praised as a courageous and wise decision that showed his leadership and diplomatic skills.",

              "The Cuban Missile Crisis represents a historical moment when two superpowers\u2014the United States and the Soviet Union\u2014were on the brink of nuclear escalation.",
              "The Cuban Missile Crisis is regarded as one of the greatest confrontations of the Cold War, when the tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union came closest to escalating into a nuclear conflict.",
              "It began on October 14, 1962, following the discovery of Soviet nuclear missiles capable of reaching the United States from Cuba.",
              "The crisis ended on October 28, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev ordered the withdrawal of all Soviet nuclear missiles in exchange for the United States\u2019 pledge that it would not invade Cuba and would remove American missiles from Turkey.",
              "The Cuban Missile Crisis only lasted 13 days, but it remains a crucial turning point in comprehending the intersections of force and diplomacy, illustrating that the latter could be applied successfully.",
              "After World War II, the ideological confrontation between the Soviet Union and Western democracies turned into an east-west competition of acquiring influence and dominance internationally.",
              "In 1946, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill warned about the \u201ciron curtain\u201d descending between the two superpowers, marking the start of the Cold War.",
              "The Cold War was characterized by hostile confrontations, the so-called \u201cproxy wars\u201d between United States-led and Soviet-led blocs and alliances;",
              "the two superpowers supported the opposing sides but did not directly participate in the conflicts.",
              "This struggle for dominance was accompanied by a major arms race.",
              "Both countries had substantially invested in their military sectors, particularly their nuclear arsenals, to prevent the other from launching an attack.",
              "By the early 1960s, as a result of the arms race, both the United States and the Soviet Union had managed to considerably develop their nuclear capabilities.",
              "Both superpowers owned the intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, a nuclear weapon capable of reaching another continent.",
              "In 1961, John F.",
              "Kennedy became president of the United States.",
              "The First Secretary of the Communist Party, Nikita Khrushchev, viewed the new president as too weak to openly oppose the Soviet Union.",
              "This perception was further reinforced when Kennedy opted not to directly oppose the Soviet Union during the Berlin Crisis of 1961: after World War II, defeated Germany was divided into occupation zones.",
              "The Soviet Union controlled East Germany, and the Allied powers (the United States, Great Britain, and France) controlled West Germany.",
              "The city of Berlin, located in Soviet-controlled East Germany, was also divided.",
              "Like West Germany, it was under the Allied powers\u2019 authority.",
              "Four million people from East Germany crossed the border of West Berlin by 1961, illustrating their dissatisfaction with the quality of life.",
              "To address the issue, Nikita Khrushchev ordered the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, intended to prevent residents from immigrating to the West.",
              "Even though the construction of the Berlin Wall concerned the United States, for Kennedy, it was \u201ca hell of a lot better than a war.",
              "\u201d Following the crisis, Khrushchev declared to Soviet authorities, \u201cI know for certain that Kennedy doesn\u2019t have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge.",
              "\u201d Since Cuba\u2019s independence in 1902, the country had experienced a number of upheavals against the ruling elite, who were accused of corruption.",
              "On March 10, 1952, Fulgencio Batista became president of Cuba after the successful revolution.",
              "During Batista\u2019s rule, American investors and businesses owned the majority of Cuba\u2019s sugar plantations, commodity industries, and mines and benefitted from Cuba\u2019s relatively friendly relations with the United States.",
              "Over time, Batista established a military dictatorship, sparking discontent among progressive youth, the most radical of which was led by a young lawyer and aspiring politician, Fidel Castro.",
              "On July 26, 1953, he led a coup against Fulgencio Batista.",
              "The main promise of Fidel Castro\u2019s socialist revolution was to remove Batista\u2019s dictatorship and to use the country\u2019s resources for the well-being of the local people.",
              "American support for Batista\u2019s administration began to weaken as it became increasingly oppressive, and by 1957, Batista could not afford to fund the army as the United States had ceased supplying him with weapons.",
              "As a result, on July 1st, 1959, Fulgencio Batista was forced to flee Cuba.",
              "After the successful removal of Batista\u2019s regime, Castro nationalized American businesses, including banks, oil refineries, and sugar and coffee plantations.",
              "He then severed Cuba\u2019s previously close relationship with the United States in favor of its Cold War rival, the Soviet Union, resulting in Cuba\u2019s dependence on Soviet military and economic aid.",
              "In response, the President of the United States, Dwight D.",
              "Eisenhower, allocated $13.",
              "1 million to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in March 1960 to eliminate Castro.",
              "With the help of Cuban counterrevolutionaries, the CIA managed to organize an invasion operation.",
              "Newly-elected President John F.",
              "Kennedy launched Operation Mongoose, usually referred to as the Bay of Pigs invasion, on April 17, 1961.",
              "The main aim of the operation was to overthrow Castro\u2019s communist regime and install a non-communist government, as outlined by Kennedy.",
              "After Castro\u2019s victory, Cuban exiles in the United States formed a counter-revolutionary military unit, Brigade 2506.",
              "The brigade became the armed wing of the Democratic Revolutionary Front (DRF), aiming to bring down Fidel Castro.",
              "The CIA sponsored the Brigade and its military training in Guatemala.",
              "The operation on the southwestern coast of Cuba began on April 17, 1961.",
              "The Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), led by Castro, showed unexpected resistance and managed to repel the invasion in just three days.",
              "Thus, the Bay of Pigs Invasion proved to be a failure of American foreign policy.",
              "It cemented Castro\u2019s role as a national hero and widened the gap between the two former allies, pushing Cuba closer to the Soviet Union.",
              "In 1959, the United States deployed 30 nuclear missiles in Italy and 15 in Turkey as part of its strategy to contain the Soviet Union and deter a potential Soviet attack on Europe.",
              "In April 1962, the American \u201cThor\u201d and \u201cJupiter\u201d missiles deployed in Turkey were activated.",
              "The Soviet Union evaluated this action as a major threat to its security.",
              "In May 1962, the Soviet Union initiated Operation \u201cAnadyr\u201d (the code name is a reference to the Anadyr River in the Bering Sea in Russia, as well as the name of the former Soviet bomber base).",
              "Nikita Khrushchev ordered the stationing of nuclear missiles in Cuba and the transfer of 40,000 Red Army fighters.",
              "The alleged American intervention in Cuba was cited as the key reason.",
              "The real motive, however, was to restore the strategic balance that the United States had broken by deploying missiles in Italy and Turkey.",
              "By the summer of 1962, the Soviet military buildup seemed conspicuous, and the CIA activated U-2 spy planes to fly over Cuba in August.",
              "By the end of the same month, the CIA confirmed the construction of the Soviet missile launch sites in Cuba, near Pinar del Ro Province.",
              "After just several months, in October, the National Photographic Interpretation Center identified the Soviet intermediate- and medium-range ballistic missiles stationed in Cuba.",
              "The SS-4 and SS-5 models were of great importance from these missiles as, if activated, they could reach key American cities, including Washington DC, in minutes.",
              "On October 16, President Kennedy was promptly briefed about the concerning developments in Cuba.",
              "Kennedy secretly established the Executive Committee, or ExComm, a group of key governmental representatives.",
              "ExComm consisted of the key political, military, and diplomatic advisers tasked with elaborating on the United States\u2019 response regarding the Soviet military activities in Cuba.",
              "The ExComm provided the President with three possible solutions: an urgent military attack and an overthrow of the Castro government, a naval blockade, or conducting diplomatic negotiations.",
              "The discussion to develop the foreign policy response to the Soviet actions in Cuba was tense and difficult.",
              "Kennedy rejected the military invasion as he tried to avoid a direct military confrontation with the Soviet Union.",
              "The United States could not rely on just diplomatic negotiations either, as relations between the two countries were already strained.",

              "During this meeting, President Kennedy was originally advised to carry out an air strike on Cuban soil in order to compromise Soviet missile supplies, followed by an invasion of the Cuban mainland.",
              "After careful consideration, President Kennedy chose a less aggressive course of action, in order to avoid a declaration of war.",
              "After consultation with EXCOMM, Kennedy ordered a naval \"quarantine\" on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba.",
              "[6] By using the term \"quarantine\", rather than \"blockade\" (an act of war by legal definition), the United States was able to avoid the implications of a state of war.",

              "After several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Khrushchev: publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to not invade Cuba again.",

              "The compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev, and the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started.",
              "Khrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and his ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place.",

              "[28] In February 1962, the US launched an embargo against Cuba,[29] and Lansdale presented a 26-page, top-secret timetable for implementation of the overthrow of the Cuban government, mandating guerrilla operations to begin in August and September.",
              "\"Open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime\" was hoped by the planners to occur in the first two weeks of October.",
              "[18] The terrorism campaign and the threat of invasion were crucial factors in the Soviet decision to position the missiles on Cuba, and in the Cuban government's decision to accept.",
              "[30][31][32][33] The US government was aware at the time, as reported to the president in a National Intelligence Estimate, that the invasion threat was a key reason for Cuban acceptance of the missiles.",
              "[34][35] When Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged \"missile gap\" with the Soviets.",
              "In fact, the US at that time led the Soviets by a wide margin, which would only increase over time.",
              "In 1961, the Soviets had only four R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).",
              "By October 1962, some intelligence estimates indicated a figure of 75.",
              "[36] The US, on the other hand, had 170 ICBMs and was quickly building more.",
              "It also had eight George Washington- and Ethan Allen-class ballistic missile submarines, with the capability to launch 16 Polaris missiles, each with a range of 2,500 nautical miles (4,600 km).",
              "Khrushchev increased the perception of a missile gap when he loudly boasted to the world that the Soviets were building missiles \"like sausages\" but Soviet missiles' numbers and capabilities were nowhere close to his assertions.",
              "The Soviet Union had medium-range ballistic missiles in quantity, about 700 of them, but they were unreliable and inaccurate.",
              "The US had a considerable advantage in its total number of nuclear warheads (27,000 against 3,600) and in the technology required for their accurate delivery.",
              "The US also led in missile defensive capabilities, naval and air power;",
              "however, the Soviets held a two-to-one advantage in conventional ground forces, more pronounced in field guns and tanks, particularly in the European theatre.",
              "[36] The Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, also had an impression of Kennedy as weak, which to him was confirmed by the President's response during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, particularly to the building of the Berlin Wall by East Germany to prevent its citizens from emigrating to the West.",
              "[37] The half-hearted nature of the Bay of Pigs invasion reinforced Khrushchev and his advisers impression that Kennedy was indecisive and, as one Soviet aide wrote, \"too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis situations.",

              ".",
              "too intelligent and too weak\".",
              "[20] Speaking to Soviet officials in the aftermath of the crisis, Khrushchev asserted, \"I know for certain that Kennedy doesn't have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge.\"",
              "He also told his son Sergei that on Cuba, Kennedy \"would make a fuss, make more of a fuss, and then agree\".",
              "[38][page needed] In May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles.",
              "[39] Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage.",
              "In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union.",
              "[40] The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness.",
              "A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965.",
              "[40] Therefore, Soviet nuclear capability in 1962 placed less emphasis on ICBMs than on medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs).",
              "The missiles could hit American allies and most of Alaska from Soviet territory but not the contiguous United States.",
              "Graham Allison, the director of Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, points out, \"The Soviet Union could not right the nuclear imbalance by deploying new ICBMs on its own soil.",
              "In order to meet the threat it faced in 1962, 1963, and 1964, it had very few options.",
              "Moving existing nuclear weapons to locations from which they could reach American targets was one.\"",
              "[41] A second reason that Soviet missiles were deployed to Cuba was that Khrushchev wanted to bring West Berlin, controlled by the American, British and French within Communist East Germany, into the Soviet orbit.",
              "The East Germans and Soviets considered western control over a portion of Berlin a grave threat to East Germany.",
              "Khrushchev made West Berlin the central battlefield of the Cold War.",
              "Khrushchev believed that if the US did nothing over the missile deployments in Cuba, he could muscle the West out of Berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western countermeasures in Berlin.",
              "If the US tried to bargain with the Soviets after it became aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for West Berlin.",
              "Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the trade would be a win for Khrushchev, as Kennedy recognized: \"The advantage is, from Khrushchev's point of view, he takes a great chance but there are quite some rewards to it.\"",
              "[42] Thirdly, from the perspective of the Soviet Union and of Cuba, it seemed that the United States wanted to increase its presence in Cuba.",
              "In view of actions including the attempt to expel Cuba from the Organization of American States,[43] placing economic sanctions on the nation, directly invading it, and the ongoing campaign of terrorism and sabotage the CIA was carrying out against the island, Cuban officials understood that America was trying to overrun Cuba.",
              "As a result, to try to prevent this, the USSR would place missiles in Cuba and neutralise the threat.",
              "This would ultimately serve to secure Cuba against attack and keep the country in the Socialist Bloc.",
              "[44] Another major reason why Khrushchev planned to place missiles on Cuba undetected was to \"level the playing field\" with the evident American nuclear threat.",
              "America had the upper hand as they could launch from Turkey and destroy the USSR before they would have a chance to react.",
              "After the emplacement of nuclear missiles in Cuba, Khrushchev had finally established mutual assured destruction, meaning that if the United States decided to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union, the latter would react by launching a retaliatory nuclear strike against the US.",
              "[45] Finally, placing nuclear missiles on Cuba was a way for the USSR to show their support for Cuba and support the Cuban people who viewed the United States as a threatening force,[43] as the latter had become their ally after the Cuban Revolution of 1959.",
              "According to Khrushchev, the Soviet Union's motives were \"aimed at allowing Cuba to live peacefully and develop as its people desire\".",
              "[46] Schlesinger, a historian and adviser to Kennedy, told National Public Radio in an interview on October 16, 2002, that Castro did not want the missiles, but Khrushchev pressured Castro to accept them.",
              "Castro was not completely happy with the idea, but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them, both to protect Cuba against US attack and to aid the Soviet Union.",
              "[47]: 272 In early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana.",
              "They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro.",
              "The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba.",
              "According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp.",
              "[48] The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.",
              "By May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba.",
              "Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America.",

              "Ernest May investigates how Kennedy demonstrated his leadership skills during the crisis.",
              "Early on Tuesday 16 October 1962, John F Kennedy's national security assistant, McGeorge Bundy, brought to the President's bedroom some high-altitude photographs taken from U-2 planes flying over Cuba.",
              "They showed Soviet soldiers hurriedly and secretly setting up nuclear-armed missiles.",
              "For some time previously the Soviets had openly been sending weaponry to Cuba, including surface-to-air anti-aircraft missiles (SAMs).",
              "To deflect any criticism about this from the Republicans, who were busy campaigning for the November congressional elections, Kennedy had said he would not protest about such defensive weaponry being installed in Cuba, but warned that if the Soviets ever introduced offensive weapons, 'the gravest issues would arise.'",
              "The 'gravest issues' were at hand.",
              "Since Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev had promised repeatedly not to send offensive weapons to Cuba, and America's top intelligence analysts had predicted that he would keep his word, Kennedy felt safe in voicing this warning.",
              "The U-2 photographs, however, showed that Khrushchev had been lying.",
              "The 'gravest issues' were at hand.",
              "The United States at the time had more than 25,000 nuclear weapons in their arsenal.",
              "The Soviet Union had not quite half as many.",
              "Kennedy's predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, had calculated in 1960 that, if a crisis led either side to fire nuclear weapons, all humans in the northern hemisphere could perish.",

              "A P2V Neptune US patrol plane flying over a Soviet freighter during the Cuban missile crisis, 1962 \u00a9 To help him decide what to do about the Cuban situation, and how much risk to run of a nuclear exchange, Kennedy assembled a small group that came to be called the Executive Committee of the National Security Council - or ExComm for short.",
              "Early in his presidency, Kennedy had had to make a decision about a CIA plan to land Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, with the hope that these exiles would overthrow Cuba's Communist government, headed by Fidel Castro.",
              "Kennedy had asked for advice about this from only a handful of people - those he knew he was officially obliged to consult.",
              "The operation proved to be a fiasco, and afterwards Kennedy had resolved in future to consult more widely.",
              "Included in the ExComm were the regular participants in National Security Council meetings, plus Kennedy's brother, the attorney general Robert Kennedy, and the President's chief speechwriter, the White House counsel Theodore Sorensen.",
              "Both of these men could help Kennedy to think about the domestic political aspects of the crisis.",

              "To meet this concern and to obtain time for gaining support from other nations, there developed the idea of the President's publicly announcing the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba, ordering a blockade to prevent the introduction of further missiles, and demanding that the Soviets withdraw the missiles already there.",
              "(Both for legal reasons and for resonance with Franklin Roosevelt's 'Quarantine Address' of 1937, the term 'quarantine' was substituted for 'blockade'.)",

              "The only protection for West Berlin was the US threat to respond to an attack by using nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union.",
              "If Kennedy demanded uncompromisingly that the Soviets remove their nuclear weapons from Cuba, Khrushchev would have to decide whether to comply or to take the risk of actual war, which might become a nuclear war.",
              "The onus would be on him.",
              "If Kennedy showed weakness in face of Khrushchev's challenge, the effect might be to embolden Khrushchev to ignore American warnings about Berlin.",

              "In the next few days, one harrowing moment followed another.",
              "Kennedy and his advisers mulled over the question of how actually to stop a Soviet ship that crossed the quarantine line.",

              "His eyes were tense, almost grey, and we just stared at each other across the table.'",
              "Fortunately, before there was an encounter at sea, Khrushchev ordered all Soviet merchantmen bound for Cuba to turn back.",
              "Meanwhile, Kennedy and his advisers faced the question of how to keep track of continuing missile construction in Cuba.",
              "At the urging of McNamara and the chiefs of staff, Kennedy authorised low-level daytime surveillance flights in addition to continuing U-2 flights.",

              "On 26-27 October, the crisis came to a head.",
              "Khrushchev cabled Kennedy that he was prepared to remove missiles from Cuba in return for a US promise not to invade Cuba - a promise that had already been given more than once.",
              "But, just as Kennedy and his ExComm began to discuss a response, Khrushchev broadcast from Moscow a second message saying the missiles would be removed if, in addition, the United States withdrew nuclear missiles and other 'offensive means' from Turkey.",
              "The second Khrushchev message provoked furious debate.",
              "With Ball in the lead, Kennedy's advisers said almost unanimously that Khrushchev's new condition was unacceptable.",

              "All this was true.",
              "He said further, however, that, if the Soviet Union used this knowledge to claim that the US had struck the deal proposed in Khrushchev's radio message, Kennedy would deny the claim and would not remove the missiles from Turkey.",
              "What Kennedy wanted was to mollify Khrushchev without seeming to make a concession, and above all to avoid any prolonged negotiations.",
              "He had to insist that Soviet missiles come out of Cuba unconditionally, or he would compromise the display of firmness that he judged necessary to protect against a Berlin crisis.",

              "Khrushchev had already decided to retreat to a simple request for a no invasion pledge.",

              "US reconnaissance aircraft kept watch while the Soviets dismantled their missiles and loaded the parts on ships for return to the Soviet Union.",
              "The world escaped nuclear war in October 1962 largely because of the prudence of Kennedy and the belated prudence of Khrushchev.",
              "Though Kennedy had felt it necessary to be uncompromising in his demand for removal of the missiles from Cuba, he had been careful to put off to the last possible moment any action that could result in killing a Russian.",

              "The crisis lasted from October 16 to October 28, 1962.",
              "The confrontation is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full-scale nuclear war.",
              "[5] In 1961, the US government put Jupiter nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey.",
              "It had also trained a paramilitary force of Cuban exiles, which the CIA led in an attempt to invade Cuba and overthrow its government.",
              "Starting in November of that year, the US government engaged in a violent campaign of terrorism and sabotage in Cuba, referred to as the Cuban Project, which continued throughout the first half of the 1960s.",
              "The Soviet administration was concerned about a Cuban drift towards China, with which the Soviets had an increasingly fractious relationship.",
              "In response to these factors, Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, agreed with the Cuban Prime Minister, Fidel Castro, to place nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba to deter a future invasion.",
              "An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Castro in July 1962, and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer.",
              "During the campaigning for the 1962 United States elections, the White House denied the charges for months and ignored the presence of Soviet missiles positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from Florida.",
              "Later, the missile preparations were confirmed when a US Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium-range R-12 (NATO code name SS-4) and intermediate-range R-14 (NATO code name SS-5) ballistic missile facilities.",
              "When this was reported to President John F.",
              "Kennedy, he then convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers, in a group that became known as the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM).",
              "During this meeting, President Kennedy was originally advised to carry out an air strike on Cuban soil in order to compromise Soviet missile supplies, followed by an invasion of the Cuban mainland.",
              "After careful consideration, President Kennedy chose a less aggressive course of action, in order to avoid a declaration of war.",
              "After consultation with EXCOMM, Kennedy ordered a naval \"quarantine\" on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba.",
              "[6] By using the term \"quarantine\", rather than \"blockade\" (an act of war by legal definition), the United States was able to avoid the implications of a state of war.",
              "[7] The US announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union.",
              "After several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Khrushchev: publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to not invade Cuba again.",
              "Secretly, the United States agreed with the Soviets that it would dismantle all of the Jupiter MRBMs which had been deployed to Turkey against the Soviet Union.",
              "There has been debate on whether Italy was included in the agreement as well.",
              "While the Soviets dismantled their missiles, some Soviet bombers remained in Cuba, and the United States kept the naval quarantine in place until November 20, 1962.",
              "[7] When all offensive missiles and the Ilyushin Il-28 light bombers had been withdrawn from Cuba, the blockade was formally ended on November 20.",
              "The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear, and direct communication line between the two superpowers.",
              "As a result, the Moscow\u2013Washington hotline was established.",
              "A series of agreements later reduced US\u2013Soviet tensions for several years, until both parties eventually resumed expanding their nuclear arsenals.",
              "The compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev, and the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started.",
              "Khrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and his ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place.",
              "According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".",
              "[8][9] In late 1961, Fidel Castro asked for more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles from the Soviet Union.",
              "The request was not acted upon by the Soviet leadership.",
              "In the interval Fidel Castro began criticizing the Soviets for lack of \"revolutionary boldness\", and began talking to China about agreements for economic assistance.",
              "In March 1962, Fidel Castro ordered the ousting of Anibal Escalante and his pro-Moscow comrades from Cuba's Integrated Revolutionary Organizations.",
              "This affair alarmed the Soviet leadership as well as fears of a possible US invasion.",
              "In this crisis of international relations the Soviet Union sent more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles in April as well as a regiment of regular Soviet troops.",
              "[10] Timothy Naftali has contended that Escalante's dismissal was a motivating factor behind the Soviet decision to place nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962.",
              "According to Naftali, Soviet foreign policy planners were concerned Castro's break with Escalante foreshadowed a Cuban drift toward China and sought to solidify the Soviet-Cuban relationship through the missile basing program.",
              "[11] The Cuban government regarded US imperialism as the primary explanation for the island's structural weaknesses.",
              "[12] The US government had provided arms, money and its authority to the Batista dictatorship.",
              "The majority of the Cuban population had tired of the severe socioeconomic problems associated with the US domination of the country.",
              "The Cuban government was aware of the necessity of ending the turmoil and incongruities of US-dominated prerevolution Cuban society.",
              "It determined that the US government's demands, made as part of the hostile US reaction to Cuban government policy, were unacceptable.",

              "[18] The terrorism campaign and the threat of invasion were crucial factors in the Soviet decision to position the missiles on Cuba, and in the Cuban government's decision to accept.",
              "[30][31][32][33] The US government was aware at the time, as reported to the president in a National Intelligence Estimate, that the invasion threat was a key reason for Cuban acceptance of the missiles.",
              "[34][35] When Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged \"missile gap\" with the Soviets.",
              "In fact, the US at that time led the Soviets by a wide margin, which would only increase over time.",
              "In 1961, the Soviets had only four R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).",
              "By October 1962, some intelligence estimates indicated a figure of 75.",

              "Khrushchev increased the perception of a missile gap when he loudly boasted to the world that the Soviets were building missiles \"like sausages\" but Soviet missiles' numbers and capabilities were nowhere close to his assertions.",
              "The Soviet Union had medium-range ballistic missiles in quantity, about 700 of them, but they were unreliable and inaccurate.",
              "The US had a considerable advantage in its total number of nuclear warheads (27,000 against 3,600) and in the technology required for their accurate delivery.",
              "The US also led in missile defensive capabilities, naval and air power;",

              "[36] The Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, also had an impression of Kennedy as weak, which to him was confirmed by the President's response during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, particularly to the building of the Berlin Wall by East Germany to prevent its citizens from emigrating to the West.",
              "[37] The half-hearted nature of the Bay of Pigs invasion reinforced Khrushchev and his advisers impression that Kennedy was indecisive and, as one Soviet aide wrote, \"too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis situations.",

              "He also told his son Sergei that on Cuba, Kennedy \"would make a fuss, make more of a fuss, and then agree\".",
              "[38][page needed] In May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles.",
              "[39] Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage.",
              "In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union.",
              "[40] The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness.",
              "A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965.",
              "[40] Therefore, Soviet nuclear capability in 1962 placed less emphasis on ICBMs than on medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs).",
              "The missiles could hit American allies and most of Alaska from Soviet territory but not the contiguous United States.",
              "Graham Allison, the director of Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, points out, \"The Soviet Union could not right the nuclear imbalance by deploying new ICBMs on its own soil.",
              "In order to meet the threat it faced in 1962, 1963, and 1964, it had very few options.",
              "Moving existing nuclear weapons to locations from which they could reach American targets was one.\"",
              "[41] A second reason that Soviet missiles were deployed to Cuba was that Khrushchev wanted to bring West Berlin, controlled by the American, British and French within Communist East Germany, into the Soviet orbit.",
              "The East Germans and Soviets considered western control over a portion of Berlin a grave threat to East Germany.",
              "Khrushchev made West Berlin the central battlefield of the Cold War.",
              "Khrushchev believed that if the US did nothing over the missile deployments in Cuba, he could muscle the West out of Berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western countermeasures in Berlin.",
              "If the US tried to bargain with the Soviets after it became aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for West Berlin.",
              "Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the trade would be a win for Khrushchev, as Kennedy recognized: \"The advantage is, from Khrushchev's point of view, he takes a great chance but there are quite some rewards to it.\"",
              "[42] Thirdly, from the perspective of the Soviet Union and of Cuba, it seemed that the United States wanted to increase its presence in Cuba.",
              "In view of actions including the attempt to expel Cuba from the Organization of American States,[43] placing economic sanctions on the nation, directly invading it, and the ongoing campaign of terrorism and sabotage the CIA was carrying out against the island, Cuban officials understood that America was trying to overrun Cuba.",
              "As a result, to try to prevent this, the USSR would place missiles in Cuba and neutralise the threat.",
              "This would ultimately serve to secure Cuba against attack and keep the country in the Socialist Bloc.",
              "[44] Another major reason why Khrushchev planned to place missiles on Cuba undetected was to \"level the playing field\" with the evident American nuclear threat.",
              "America had the upper hand as they could launch from Turkey and destroy the USSR before they would have a chance to react.",
              "After the emplacement of nuclear missiles in Cuba, Khrushchev had finally established mutual assured destruction, meaning that if the United States decided to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union, the latter would react by launching a retaliatory nuclear strike against the US.",
              "[45] Finally, placing nuclear missiles on Cuba was a way for the USSR to show their support for Cuba and support the Cuban people who viewed the United States as a threatening force,[43] as the latter had become their ally after the Cuban Revolution of 1959.",
              "According to Khrushchev, the Soviet Union's motives were \"aimed at allowing Cuba to live peacefully and develop as its people desire\".",
              "[46] Schlesinger, a historian and adviser to Kennedy, told National Public Radio in an interview on October 16, 2002, that Castro did not want the missiles, but Khrushchev pressured Castro to accept them.",
              "Castro was not completely happy with the idea, but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them, both to protect Cuba against US attack and to aid the Soviet Union.",

              "They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro.",
              "The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba.",
              "According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp.",
              "[48] The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.",
              "By May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba.",
              "Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America.",

              "Conflict resolved diplomatically The Cuban Missile Crisis, also known as the October Crisis (of 1962) (Spanish: Crisis de Octubre) in Cuba, or the Missile Scare, was a 13-day confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, when American deployments of nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey were matched by Soviet deployments of nuclear missiles in Cuba.",
              "The crisis lasted from October 16 to October 28, 1962.",
              "The confrontation is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full-scale nuclear war.",
              "[5] In 1961, the US government put Jupiter nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey.",
              "It had also trained a paramilitary force of Cuban exiles, which the CIA led in an attempt to invade Cuba and overthrow its government.",
              "Starting in November of that year, the US government engaged in a violent campaign of terrorism and sabotage in Cuba, referred to as the Cuban Project, which continued throughout the first half of the 1960s.",
              "The Soviet administration was concerned about a Cuban drift towards China, with which the Soviets had an increasingly fractious relationship.",
              "In response to these factors, Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, agreed with the Cuban Prime Minister, Fidel Castro, to place nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba to deter a future invasion.",
              "An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Castro in July 1962, and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer.",
              "During the campaigning for the 1962 United States elections, the White House denied the charges for months and ignored the presence of Soviet missiles positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from Florida.",
              "Later, the missile preparations were confirmed when a US Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium-range R-12 (NATO code name SS-4) and intermediate-range R-14 (NATO code name SS-5) ballistic missile facilities.",
              "When this was reported to President John F.",
              "Kennedy, he then convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers, in a group that became known as the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM).",
              "During this meeting, President Kennedy was originally advised to carry out an air strike on Cuban soil in order to compromise Soviet missile supplies, followed by an invasion of the Cuban mainland.",
              "After careful consideration, President Kennedy chose a less aggressive course of action, in order to avoid a declaration of war.",
              "After consultation with EXCOMM, Kennedy ordered a naval \"quarantine\" on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba.",
              "[6] By using the term \"quarantine\", rather than \"blockade\" (an act of war by legal definition), the United States was able to avoid the implications of a state of war.",
              "[7] The US announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union.",
              "After several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Khrushchev: publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to not invade Cuba again.",
              "Secretly, the United States agreed with the Soviets that it would dismantle all of the Jupiter MRBMs which had been deployed to Turkey against the Soviet Union.",
              "There has been debate on whether Italy was included in the agreement as well.",
              "While the Soviets dismantled their missiles, some Soviet bombers remained in Cuba, and the United States kept the naval quarantine in place until November 20, 1962.",
              "[7] When all offensive missiles and the Ilyushin Il-28 light bombers had been withdrawn from Cuba, the blockade was formally ended on November 20.",
              "The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear, and direct communication line between the two superpowers.",
              "As a result, the Moscow\u2013Washington hotline was established.",
              "A series of agreements later reduced US\u2013Soviet tensions for several years, until both parties eventually resumed expanding their nuclear arsenals.",
              "The compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev, and the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started.",
              "Khrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and his ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place.",
              "According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".",
              "[8][9] In late 1961, Fidel Castro asked for more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles from the Soviet Union.",
              "The request was not acted upon by the Soviet leadership.",
              "In the interval Fidel Castro began criticizing the Soviets for lack of \"revolutionary boldness\", and began talking to China about agreements for economic assistance.",
              "In March 1962, Fidel Castro ordered the ousting of Anibal Escalante and his pro-Moscow comrades from Cuba's Integrated Revolutionary Organizations.",
              "This affair alarmed the Soviet leadership as well as fears of a possible US invasion.",
              "In this crisis of international relations the Soviet Union sent more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles in April as well as a regiment of regular Soviet troops.",
              "[10] Timothy Naftali has contended that Escalante's dismissal was a motivating factor behind the Soviet decision to place nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962.",
              "According to Naftali, Soviet foreign policy planners were concerned Castro's break with Escalante foreshadowed a Cuban drift toward China and sought to solidify the Soviet-Cuban relationship through the missile basing program.",
              "[11] The Cuban government regarded US imperialism as the primary explanation for the island's structural weaknesses.",
              "[12] The US government had provided arms, money and its authority to the Batista dictatorship.",
              "The majority of the Cuban population had tired of the severe socioeconomic problems associated with the US domination of the country.",
              "The Cuban government was aware of the necessity of ending the turmoil and incongruities of US-dominated prerevolution Cuban society.",
              "It determined that the US government's demands, made as part of the hostile US reaction to Cuban government policy, were unacceptable.",
              "[12][13] With the end of World War II and the start of the Cold War, the United States government sought to promote private enterprise as an instrument for advancing US strategic interests in the developing world.",
              "[14] It had grown concerned about the expansion of communism.",
              "In December 1959, under the Eisenhower administration and less than twelve months after the Cuban Revolution, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) developed a plan for paramilitary action against Cuba.",
              "The CIA recruited operatives on the island to carry out terrorism and sabotage, kill civilians, and cause economic damage.",
              "[19] At the initiative of the CIA Deputy Director for Plans, Richard Bissell, and approved by the new President John F.",
              "Kennedy, the US launched the attempted Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961.",
              "It used CIA-trained forces of Cuban expatriates.",
              "The complete failure of the invasion, and the exposure of the US government role before the operation began, was a source of diplomatic embarrassment for the administration.",
              "Afterward, former President Eisenhower told Kennedy that \"the failure of the Bay of Pigs will embolden the Soviets to do something that they would otherwise not do.\"",
              "[20]: 10 Following the failed invasion, the US massively escalated its sponsorship of terrorism against Cuba.",
              "In late 1961, using the military and the Central Intelligence Agency, the US government engaged in an extensive campaign of state-sponsored terrorism against civilian and military targets on the island.",
              "The terrorist attacks killed significant numbers of civilians.",
              "The US armed, trained, funded and directed the terrorists, most of whom were Cuban expatriates.",
              "Terrorist attacks were planned at the direction and with the participation of US government employees and launched from US territory.",
              "[26] In January 1962, US Air Force General Edward Lansdale described the plans to overthrow the Cuban government in a top-secret report, addressed to Kennedy and officials involved with Operation Mongoose.",
              "[27][18] CIA agents or \"pathfinders\" from the Special Activities Division were to be infiltrated into Cuba to carry out sabotage and organization, including radio broadcasts.",
              "[28] In February 1962, the US launched an embargo against Cuba,[29] and Lansdale presented a 26-page, top-secret timetable for implementation of the overthrow of the Cuban government, mandating guerrilla operations to begin in August and September.",
              "\"Open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime\" was hoped by the planners to occur in the first two weeks of October.",
              "[18] The terrorism campaign and the threat of invasion were crucial factors in the Soviet decision to position the missiles on Cuba, and in the Cuban government's decision to accept.",
              "[30][31][32][33] The US government was aware at the time, as reported to the president in a National Intelligence Estimate, that the invasion threat was a key reason for Cuban acceptance of the missiles.",
              "[34][35] When Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged \"missile gap\" with the Soviets.",
              "In fact, the US at that time led the Soviets by a wide margin, which would only increase over time.",
              "In 1961, the Soviets had only four R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).",
              "By October 1962, some intelligence estimates indicated a figure of 75.",
              "[36] The US, on the other hand, had 170 ICBMs and was quickly building more.",
              "It also had eight George Washington- and Ethan Allen-class ballistic missile submarines, with the capability to launch 16 Polaris missiles, each with a range of 2,500 nautical miles (4,600 km).",
              "Khrushchev increased the perception of a missile gap when he loudly boasted to the world that the Soviets were building missiles \"like sausages\" but Soviet missiles' numbers and capabilities were nowhere close to his assertions.",
              "The Soviet Union had medium-range ballistic missiles in quantity, about 700 of them, but they were unreliable and inaccurate.",
              "The US had a considerable advantage in its total number of nuclear warheads (27,000 against 3,600) and in the technology required for their accurate delivery.",
              "The US also led in missile defensive capabilities, naval and air power;",
              "however, the Soviets held a two-to-one advantage in conventional ground forces, more pronounced in field guns and tanks, particularly in the European theatre.",
              "[36] The Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, also had an impression of Kennedy as weak, which to him was confirmed by the President's response during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, particularly to the building of the Berlin Wall by East Germany to prevent its citizens from emigrating to the West.",
              "[37] The half-hearted nature of the Bay of Pigs invasion reinforced Khrushchev and his advisers impression that Kennedy was indecisive and, as one Soviet aide wrote, \"too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis situations.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "too intelligent and too weak\".",
              "[20] Speaking to Soviet officials in the aftermath of the crisis, Khrushchev asserted, \"I know for certain that Kennedy doesn't have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge.\"",
              "He also told his son Sergei that on Cuba, Kennedy \"would make a fuss, make more of a fuss, and then agree\".",
              "[38][page needed] In May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles.",
              "[39] Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage.",
              "In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union.",
              "[40] The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness.",
              "A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965.",
              "[40] Therefore, Soviet nuclear capability in 1962 placed less emphasis on ICBMs than on medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs).",
              "The missiles could hit American allies and most of Alaska from Soviet territory but not the contiguous United States.",
              "Graham Allison, the director of Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, points out, \"The Soviet Union could not right the nuclear imbalance by deploying new ICBMs on its own soil.",
              "In order to meet the threat it faced in 1962, 1963, and 1964, it had very few options.",
              "Moving existing nuclear weapons to locations from which they could reach American targets was one.\"",
              "[41] A second reason that Soviet missiles were deployed to Cuba was that Khrushchev wanted to bring West Berlin, controlled by the American, British and French within Communist East Germany, into the Soviet orbit.",
              "The East Germans and Soviets considered western control over a portion of Berlin a grave threat to East Germany.",
              "Khrushchev made West Berlin the central battlefield of the Cold War.",
              "Khrushchev believed that if the US did nothing over the missile deployments in Cuba, he could muscle the West out of Berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western countermeasures in Berlin.",
              "If the US tried to bargain with the Soviets after it became aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for West Berlin.",
              "Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the trade would be a win for Khrushchev, as Kennedy recognized: \"The advantage is, from Khrushchev's point of view, he takes a great chance but there are quite some rewards to it.\"",
              "[42] Thirdly, from the perspective of the Soviet Union and of Cuba, it seemed that the United States wanted to increase its presence in Cuba.",
              "In view of actions including the attempt to expel Cuba from the Organization of American States,[43] placing economic sanctions on the nation, directly invading it, and the ongoing campaign of terrorism and sabotage the CIA was carrying out against the island, Cuban officials understood that America was trying to overrun Cuba.",
              "As a result, to try to prevent this, the USSR would place missiles in Cuba and neutralise the threat.",
              "This would ultimately serve to secure Cuba against attack and keep the country in the Socialist Bloc.",
              "[44] Another major reason why Khrushchev planned to place missiles on Cuba undetected was to \"level the playing field\" with the evident American nuclear threat.",
              "America had the upper hand as they could launch from Turkey and destroy the USSR before they would have a chance to react.",
              "After the emplacement of nuclear missiles in Cuba, Khrushchev had finally established mutual assured destruction, meaning that if the United States decided to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union, the latter would react by launching a retaliatory nuclear strike against the US.",
              "[45] Finally, placing nuclear missiles on Cuba was a way for the USSR to show their support for Cuba and support the Cuban people who viewed the United States as a threatening force,[43] as the latter had become their ally after the Cuban Revolution of 1959.",
              "According to Khrushchev, the Soviet Union's motives were \"aimed at allowing Cuba to live peacefully and develop as its people desire\".",
              "[46] Schlesinger, a historian and adviser to Kennedy, told National Public Radio in an interview on October 16, 2002, that Castro did not want the missiles, but Khrushchev pressured Castro to accept them.",
              "Castro was not completely happy with the idea, but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them, both to protect Cuba against US attack and to aid the Soviet Union.",
              "[47]: 272 In early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana.",
              "They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro.",
              "The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba.",
              "According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp.",
              "[48] The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.",
              "By May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba.",
              "Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America.",
              "He said he wanted to confront the Americans \"with more than words.",
              ".",
              ".",
              ".",
              "the logical answer was missiles\".",
              "[49]: 29 The Soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by Marshal of the Soviet Union Rodion Malinovsky on July 4 and Khrushchev on July 7.",
              "From the very beginning, the Soviets' operation entailed elaborate denial and deception, known as \"maskirovka\".",
              "All the planning and preparation for transporting and deploying the missiles were carried out in the utmost secrecy, with only a very few told the exact nature of the mission.",
              "Even the troops detailed for the mission were given misdirection by being told that they were headed for a cold region and being outfitted with ski boots, fleece-lined parkas, and other winter equipment.",
              "The Soviet code-name was Operation Anadyr.",
              "The Anadyr River flows into the Bering Sea, and Anadyr is also the capital of Chukotsky District and a bomber base in the far eastern region.",
              "All the measures were meant to conceal the program from both internal and external audiences.",
              "[50] Specialists in missile construction, under the guise of machine operators and agricultural specialists, arrived in July.",
              "[50] A total of 43,000 foreign troops would ultimately be brought in.",
              "[51] Chief Marshal of Artillery Sergei Biryuzov, Head of the Soviet Rocket Forces, led a survey team that visited Cuba.",
              "He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by palm trees.",
              "[36] As early as August 1962, the US suspected the Soviets of building missile facilities in Cuba.",
              "During that month, its intelligence services gathered information about sightings by ground observers of Soviet-built MiG-21 fighters and Il-28 light bombers.",
              "U-2 spy planes found S-75 Dvina (NATO designation SA-2) surface-to-air missile sites at eight different locations.",
              "CIA director John A.",
              "McCone was suspicious.",
              "Sending antiaircraft missiles into Cuba, he reasoned, \"made sense only if Moscow intended to use them to shield a base for ballistic missiles aimed at the United States\".",

              "McCone outlined three options: 1) \u201cDo nothing and live with the situation,\u201d 2) \u201cResort to an all-out blockade which would probably require a declaration of war and to be effective would mean the interruption of all incoming shipping,\u201d or 3) \u201cMilitary action,\u201d which in turn had a number of possibilities ranging from targeted strikes on missile sites to an all-out invasion of the island (Hanhimaki and Westad 484).",
              "Kennedy wisely ruled out a military strike, noting that it was likely to miss at least some of the missiles and would prompt Soviet retaliation, probably against a vulnerable West Berlin.",
              "He ultimately chose the second option proposed by the CIA, but with one crucial difference.",
              "Rather than publicly calling it a \u201cblockade,\u201d which as McCone noted would have required a declaration of war, Kennedy instead termed it a \u201cquarantine.",
              "\u201d His military advisers nevertheless continued to push for an attack, to which Kennedy sardonically quipped, \u201cThese brass hats have one great advantage in their favor.",
              "If we listen to them, and do what they want us to do, none of us will be alive later to tell them that they were wrong\u201d (Sheehan 445).",
              "Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara later affirmed that an American invasion would have prompted Soviet forces in Cuba \u201cto use their nuclear weapons rather than lose them\u201d (Rhodes 100).",
              "Kennedy announced the blockade on October 22 in a speech that evoked the Monroe Doctrine, a nineteenth century policy which established the United States\u2019 sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere by opposing any future European colonization in the Americas: \u201cIt shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union.",
              "\u201d Kennedy also ordered the Strategic Air Command (SAC) into Defense Condition 3 (DEFCON 3) and two days later upped it to DEFCON 2, only one step short of nuclear war.",

              "Firing without a direct order from Moscow, however, required the consent of all three senior officers on board.",

              "Why not surface and then await orders from Moscow?",
              "In the end, Arkhipov\u2019s view prevailed.",
              "The B-59 surfaced near the American warships and the submarine set off north to return to the Soviet Union without incident.",
              "Although the Americans and the Soviets ultimately reached an agreement, it took almost a week of tense negotiations following the institution of the blockade.",
              "Meanwhile, the fate of the world continued to hang in the balance.",
              "On October 26, Khrushchev sent a private letter to Kennedy proposing a resolution to the crisis: \u201cWe, for our part, will declare that our ships, bound for Cuba, will not carry any kind of armaments.",
              "You would declare that the United States will not invade Cuba with its forces and will not support any sort of forces which might intend to carry out an invasion of Cuba.",
              "Then the necessity for the presence of our military specialists in Cuba would disappear.",
              "\u201d A deal was on the table\u2014the Soviet Union would remove the missiles if the United States was willing to accept Castro\u2019s communist regime in Cuba.",

              "The Soviet Union would stand down in Cuba only if the United States agreed to remove the Jupiter missiles deployed in Turkey.",
              "Later that day, an American U-2 reconnaissance plane was shot down over Cuba.",

              "The United States was willing remove the missiles from Turkey within five months, but under the condition that it not be part of any public resolution to the conflict.",
              "Given that Turkey was a member of NATO, an admission that the United States was trading missiles in Turkey to resolve the situation in Cuba would have undermined the alliance.",
              "The secret agreement was not revealed until decades later.",
              "The next day, Khrushchev sent a letter to Kennedy agreeing to the terms and announced an effective end to the crisis on Radio Moscow: \u201cThe Soviet government, in addition to previously issued instructions on the cessation of further work at building sites for the weapons, has issued a new order on the dismantling of the weapons which you describe as \u2018offensive,\u2019 and their crating and return to the Soviet Union.",
              "\u201d Kennedy hailed the decision as \u201can important and constructive contribution to peace\u201d while warning of \u201cthe compelling necessity for ending the arms race and reducing world tensions.",

              "The United States lifted the blockade on November 20 and removed the Jupiter missiles from Turkey by April 1963.",
              "In the end, however, the removal of the missiles was a fairly meaningless gesture as the new Minuteman ICBMs had rendered the Jupiters obsolete.",
              "The shock of the Cuban Missile Crisis was a highly influential factor in the success of future arms control negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, such as the ban on atmospheric testing.",

              "Many nuclear historians agree that 27 October 1962, known as \u201cBlack Saturday\u201d, was the closest the world came to nuclear catastrophe, as US forces enforced a blockade of Cuba to stop deliveries of Soviet missiles.",

              "In October 1962, the US sent its anti-submarine forces to hunt down Soviet submarines trying to slip through the \u201cquarantine\u201d imposed on Cuba.",
              "The most perilous moment came when one of those submarines, B-59, was forced to surface late at night in the Sargasso Sea to recharge its batteries and found itself surrounded by US destroyers and anti-submarine planes circling overhead.",
              "In a newly translated account, one of the senior officers on board, Captain Second Class Vasily Arkhipov, described the scene.",
              "\u201cOverflights by planes just 20-30 metres above the submarine\u2019s conning tower, use of powerful searchlights, fire from automatic cannons (over 300 shells), dropping depth charges, cutting in front of the submarine by destroyers at a dangerously [small] distance, targeting guns at the submarine,\u201d Arkhipov, the chief of staff of the 69th submarine brigade, recalled.",
              "In his account, first given in 1997 but published for the first time in English by the National Security Archive at George Washington University, the submarine\u2019s commander, Valentin Savitsky, lost his nerve.",

              "\u201d In his account, Arkhipov played down his role and how close the B-59 submarine commander, Savitsky, came to launching the submarine\u2019s one nuclear-tipped torpedo.",
              "However, Svetlana Savranskaya, the director of the National Security Archive\u2019s Russian programmes, interviewed another submarine commander from the same brigade, Ryurik Ketov, who said Savitsky was convinced they were under attack and that the war with the US had started.",
              "The commander panicked, calling for an \u201curgent dive\u201d and for the number one torpedo with the nuclear warhead to be prepared.",
              "However, because the signalling officer was in the way, Savitsky could not immediately get down the narrow stairway through the conning tower, and during those few moments of hesitation, Arkhipov realised that the US forces were signalling rather than attacking, and deliberately firing off to the side of the submarine.",
              "\u201cHe called to Savitsky and said: \u2018calm down, look they are signalling, not attacking, let\u2019s signal back.",

              "Tom Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive, said the aggressive tactics used by the American submarine hunters contributed to the close shave.",
              "At a conference in Havana in 2002, John Peterson, a lieutenant on the USS Beale, the destroyer closest to the Russian submarine, said he and his crew resented their orders to use only practice depth charges, which just made a loud bang.",
              "So they stuffed hand grenades into toilet roll tubes which would hold the pin down for a couple of hundred metres before disintegrating, and causing the grenade to explode next to the submarine\u2019s hull.",
              "The Russian signals intelligence officer on the B-59, Vadim Orlov, said the experience was like being inside an oil drum beaten by a sledgehammer.",
              "The officers and crew were already exhausted.",
              "They had sailed all the way from the Russian far north, in submarines that were not adapted for warm waters.",
              "Internal temperatures in the engine compartment rose to up to 65 degrees Celsius, with carbon dioxide levels several times normal, and there was very little drinking water, Arkhipov recalled.",

              "A U-2 went missing over Siberia when the pilot lost his bearings, blinded by the aurora borealis and misled by compass malfunction close to the north pole.",
              "Some F-102 interceptor jets were scrambled to protect the U-2, but the joint chiefs of staff who gave the order for their launch were not aware they had been armed with nuclear missiles as a matter of course once the alert level was raised to Defcon 2.",
              "Minutes later, the joint chiefs heard that another U-2 had been shot down over Cuba and assumed it was a deliberate escalation by Moscow.",
              "In fact, the order had been given independently by two Soviet generals in Cuba.",
              "The joint chiefs were also unaware that there were 80 nuclear warheads on the missiles already in Cuba when they gave their recommendation for the US to carry out airstrikes and then an invasion of Cuba.",
              "The recommendation was overruled by president John Kennedy, as negotiations with Soviet representatives, some of them in a Washington Chinese restaurant, were making progress, leading ultimately to the withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba while US missiles were pulled back from Turkey.",

              "British officials are not convinced it was an accident, but intercepted communications made clear that Russian ground controllers were shocked at what happened, suggesting that if it was a deliberate show of force it was the decision of the pilot, rather than an order from Moscow.",
              "The close encounter prompted an unscheduled visit to Washington on 18 October by the UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, to coordinate responses in the event of a miscalculation or accidental clash between Nato and Russian forces, and to ask for Washington\u2019s agreement for the UK to restart Rivet Joint patrols with fighter escorts.",
