    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. I'm glad you asked about this classic novel. According to the search results, Harper Lee was inspired by several factors when she wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. Some of them are:\n\n- Her father, Amasa Coleman Lee, who was a lawyer and defended two African American men accused of murder[^1^] [^2^].\n- Her childhood friend and neighbour, Truman Capote, who became a famous author and was the basis for the character of Dill[^1^] [^2^].\n- A recluse who lived near her and Capote, who may have influenced the character of Boo Radley[^2^].\n- The social and historical context of the American South in the 1930s, where racism and prejudice were prevalent[^2^] [^3^].\n\nThe title of the novel refers to the idea of innocence and how it can be destroyed by evil. Atticus Finch tells his children that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because they are harmless creatures that only sing[^4^]. This symbolizes the characters of Tom Robinson and Boo Radley, who are both innocent victims of society's cruelty[^5^].",

              "\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" Lee's first book, was published in 1960 to immediate fanfare.",
              "The book introduced beloved characters Atticus Finch, Scout and Boo Radley, as it told the story of a small-town Southern lawyer who defended an African American man accused of rape.",

              "Her novel gives us a particular point of view of an independent southern woman's voice and we don't have anything quite like that from other southern women writers,\" Eichelberger said.",
              "The book was assigned widely in American schools and quickly became a literary and popular favorite -- worldwide sales topped 40 million.",
              "Lee won the Pulitzer Prize for her work.",

              "He nursed his envy for more than 20 years.",
              "\u201d Despite the tension, Lee continued to help Capote on the Clutter project, as he became increasingly obsessed with the case, developing relationships with the two men convicted and eventually executed for the crime.",
              "It took him nearly five years to publish his New Yorker series, which he then expanded into a book.",
              "When In Cold Blood was published in 1966 it too was a sensation, with many hailing Capote for creating a new genre, the \u201ctrue crime\u201d narrative non-fiction.",
              "But some, including Lee (at least in private), criticized his willingness to alter facts and situations to fit his narrative.",
              "She would later describe Capote in a letter to a friend, noting, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you understood this about him, but his compulsive lying was like this: if you said, \u2018Did you know JFK was shot?",
              "\u2019 He\u2019d easily answer, \u2018Yes, I was driving the car he was riding in.",
              "\u2019\u201d Despite her years of work and her unending public support of Capote\u2019s work, he did not officially recognize her contributions to In Cold Blood, instead of mentioning both her and his lover in the book\u2019s acknowledgments section.",
              "Lee was deeply hurt by the omission.",
              "Capote\u2019s literary career went into decline following In Cold Blood.",
              "Though he wrote a number of articles for magazines and newspapers, he never published another novel.",
              "Instead, he became a fixture of the post-war jet set, partying and befriending a number of high-profile figures, including a group of mostly married, wealthy women who he dubbed his \u201cSwans.",
              "\u201d In 1975, Esquire magazine published a chapter of Capote\u2019s unfinished book, Answered Prayers.",
              "The excerpt, a thinly-veiled account of the lives and scandalous loves of many of Capote\u2019s society friends, was a disaster, leading many of them to ostracize him and leaving his literary career in tatters.",
              "As Capote descended into a life of alcohol, drugs, television show appearances, and Studio 54 night-clubbing, the publicity-phobic Lee pulled away from the spotlight entirely.",
              "She lived quietly in Alabama, along with under-the-radar trips to New York City.",
              "Her refusal to grant interviews and the lack of a follow-up to Mockingbird led to decades of rumors that it actually was Capote who had written all or part of the book \u2013 although the publicity-mad Capote certainly would have revealed his role if that had been the case.",
              "By the time of Capote\u2019s death in 1984, he was estranged from many of the people with whom he\u2019d once been close, including Lee.",
              "She died in 2016 just months after the publication of Go Set a Watchmen, an early version of To Kill a Mockingbird, which Lee had set aside in the 1950s.",
              "The book raced up the charts, although fans of Mockingbird were shocked to discover a far less idealized version of Atticus Finch, the lawyer character based on Lee\u2019s father.",
              "But this first draft did include remembrances from Lee\u2019s early years, including Dill Harris, easily recognizable as the brash young boy named Truman whom the shy Lee had befriended years before.",

              "Well, now a letter from Truman Capote to his aunt, dated July 9, 1959, should help put that rumor to rest.",

              "It was, as I understand it, given to a museum from a cousin of Mr.",
              "Capote.",
              "What does it say and how does it help quash this rumor?",
              "FLYNT: Essentially, it says that a year before the novel was published in July of 1960, that Capote had seen the novel, had read much of the book, and liked it very much, and commented that she has great talent.",
              "And nowhere in the letter does he claim any involvement whatsoever in the book.",
              "BLOCK: And by saying that he's seen it would appear to put some distance at least with it?",
              "FLYNT: That's correct.",
              "That's correct.",
              "BLOCK: How did this rumor get started in the first place?",
              "FLYNT: Well, some claim Pearl Belle, who is a literary critic and editor in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has actually claimed that Capote implied to her that he had written the book or had a good deal to do with the writing of the book.",
              "I think probably the rumor results from the fact that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the only published book that Harper Lee ever did.",
              "BLOCK: Yeah, that that would fuel it.",
              "In other words, she was one and done, and if she were such a great writer, why wouldn't she keep writing great books?",
              "FLYNT: Exactly.",
              "Which basically judges her by the standards of our own culture, which is once you've got a taste of fame and fortune, why in the world wouldn't you continue it?",
              "BLOCK: If you look closely at TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and the writing of Truman Capote, do you see anyway that Truman Capote could have written TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD?",
              "FLYNT: No.",
              "The voice of the characters in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a totally different literary voice.",
              "Some have claimed that he's so brilliant that he could have simply assumed the voice of his good friend Harper Lee.",
              "I don't believe that for a minute.",
              "Writers simply don't assume another voice, another persona, another kind of literary style.",
              "Hers is very much the same style as her writing in the Crimson White eight years before this book is published.",

              "BLOCK: Can you tell us anything that she might have told you, without violating the confidence?",
              "FLYNT: Not really, because she's such a private person.",
              "And I think to ask her the question would be to do the very thing that so many people have done, which is to interrupt her privacy.",
              "And I think that she understands this as part of hype that goes along with the mythology of Truman Capote and Harper Lee.",
              "They're both a part of mythology.",
              "BLOCK: Do you really think this letter from Truman Capote alluding to a book from Harper Lee that he has seen and that he thinks is quite good, do you think that will actually kill the rumor that he actually wrote the book?",
              "FLYNT: I think it will go along way towards that, although I think the most convincing evidence is really inferential evidence.",
              "Here's a person who was known for his enormous ego and for his banter and for his self-promotion.",
              "Here's a man who wanted desperately to win the National Book Award and wanted desperately to win the Pulitzer Prize and never won either one of them.",
              "And to assume, as jealous as he was of Harper Lee's success, he would not have claimed credit for this if he in fact done it, is simply too much for me to believe.",
              "So I don't know that we needed this letter, but I suppose it does put to rest some of the naysayers out there and some of the people who have claimed that she really is not a great literary talent.",

              "Well, now a letter from Truman Capote to his aunt, dated July 9, 1959, should help put that rumor to rest.",
              "Joining us to talk about it is Wayne Flynt.",
              "He is a retired history professor at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama.",
              "And he has researched the writings of both Harper Lee and Truman Capote.",
              "Welcome.",
              "WAYNE FLYNT: Thank you.",
              "BLOCK: Let's talk first about this letter from Truman Capote.",
              "It's now been made public.",
              "It was, as I understand it, given to a museum from a cousin of Mr.",
              "Capote.",
              "What does it say and how does it help quash this rumor?",
              "FLYNT: Essentially, it says that a year before the novel was published in July of 1960, that Capote had seen the novel, had read much of the book, and liked it very much, and commented that she has great talent.",
              "And nowhere in the letter does he claim any involvement whatsoever in the book.",
              "BLOCK: And by saying that he's seen it would appear to put some distance at least with it?",
              "FLYNT: That's correct.",
              "That's correct.",
              "BLOCK: How did this rumor get started in the first place?",
              "FLYNT: Well, some claim Pearl Belle, who is a literary critic and editor in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has actually claimed that Capote implied to her that he had written the book or had a good deal to do with the writing of the book.",
              "I think probably the rumor results from the fact that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the only published book that Harper Lee ever did.",
              "BLOCK: Yeah, that that would fuel it.",
              "In other words, she was one and done, and if she were such a great writer, why wouldn't she keep writing great books?",
              "FLYNT: Exactly.",
              "Which basically judges her by the standards of our own culture, which is once you've got a taste of fame and fortune, why in the world wouldn't you continue it?",
              "BLOCK: If you look closely at TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and the writing of Truman Capote, do you see anyway that Truman Capote could have written TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD?",
              "FLYNT: No.",
              "The voice of the characters in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a totally different literary voice.",
              "Some have claimed that he's so brilliant that he could have simply assumed the voice of his good friend Harper Lee.",
              "I don't believe that for a minute.",
              "Writers simply don't assume another voice, another persona, another kind of literary style.",
              "Hers is very much the same style as her writing in the Crimson White eight years before this book is published.",
              "BLOCK: Wayne Flynt, have you met Harper Lee yourself?",
              "FLYNT: Yes.",
              "BLOCK: And you've talked to her about this?",
              "FLYNT: Yes.",
              "BLOCK: Can you tell us anything that she might have told you, without violating the confidence?",
              "FLYNT: Not really, because she's such a private person.",
              "And I think to ask her the question would be to do the very thing that so many people have done, which is to interrupt her privacy.",
              "And I think that she understands this as part of hype that goes along with the mythology of Truman Capote and Harper Lee.",
              "They're both a part of mythology.",
              "BLOCK: Do you really think this letter from Truman Capote alluding to a book from Harper Lee that he has seen and that he thinks is quite good, do you think that will actually kill the rumor that he actually wrote the book?",
              "FLYNT: I think it will go along way towards that, although I think the most convincing evidence is really inferential evidence.",
              "Here's a person who was known for his enormous ego and for his banter and for his self-promotion.",
              "Here's a man who wanted desperately to win the National Book Award and wanted desperately to win the Pulitzer Prize and never won either one of them.",
              "And to assume, as jealous as he was of Harper Lee's success, he would not have claimed credit for this if he in fact done it, is simply too much for me to believe.",
              "So I don't know that we needed this letter, but I suppose it does put to rest some of the naysayers out there and some of the people who have claimed that she really is not a great literary talent.",
              "BLOCK: Well, Wayne Flynt, good to talk to you.",
              "Thanks so much.",
              "FLYNT: Thank you.",
              "BLOCK: Wayne Flynt is a retired Professor of History at Auburn University in Alabama.",
