    "response": "The first computer virus is generally regarded as **Brain**, which was released on 19 January 1986 by two brothers from Pakistan, Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi. It infected IBM PC and compatibles by replacing the boot sector of a floppy disk with a copy of the virus[^5^]. The virus displayed a message on the infected machine with the brothers' names, address and phone number, and a message that said \\\"Welcome to the Dungeon\\\"[^5^].\n\nHowever, before Brain, there were other experimental programs that exhibited virus-like behavior. One of them was **Creeper**, written in 1971 by Bob Thomas at BBN Technologies. It was designed to test John von Neumann's theory of self-reproducing automata and it infected DEC PDP-10 computers running the TENEX operating system via the ARPANET. It displayed the message \\\"I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!\\\"[^3^] [^2^]. Another program called **Reaper** was later created to delete Creeper[^4^].\n\nThere were also other fictional representations of computer viruses in literature and movies, such as The Scarred Man by Gregory Benford (1970), When HARLIE Was One by David Gerrold (1972), and Westworld by Michael Crichton (1973)[^2^].",

              "This tracking program was supposed to stop and track illegal copies of the disk, however the program also sometimes used the last five kilobytes on an Apple floppy, making additional saves to the disk by other programs impossible.",

              "Thus the first computer worm was born.",
              "Although Creeper is the first known example of a worm, it is not actually malware.",
              "As a proof of concept, Creeper wasn\u2019t made with malicious intent and didn\u2019t damage or disrupt the systems it infected, instead only displaying the whimsical message: \u201cI\u2019M THE CREEPER : CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.",

              "First identified in 2007, Zeus infected personal computers via phishing and drive-by-downloads and demonstrated the dangerous potential of a trojan-style virus that can deliver many different types of malicious software.",

              "Unluckily, the CyrptoLocker program is also spread through basic phishing attacks as well and remains a persistent threat.",
              "Once called the \u201cking of malware\u201d by Arne Schoenbohm, head of the German Office for Information Security, the Emotet trojan is a prime example of what\u2019s known as polymorphic malware making it difficult for information security specialists to ever fully eradicate.",
              "Polymorphic malware works by slightly altering its own code every time it reproduces, creating not an exact copy, but a variant that\u2019s just as dangerous.",
              "In fact, it\u2019s more dangerous because polymorphic trojans are harder for anti-malware programs to identify and block.",

              "Although malware had already played a part in cyber warfare for many years, 2017 was a banner year for state-sponsored cyberattacks and virtual espionage, beginning with a relatively unremarkable ransomware called Petya.",
              "Although dangerous, the Petya ransomware spread through phishing and was not particularly infectious until it was modified into the NotPetya wiper worm, a program that looked like ransomware, but destroyed user data even if ransom payments were sent.",
              "That same year saw the WannaCry ransomware worm strike a number of high-profile targets in Europe, particularly in Britain\u2019s National Health Service.",
              "NotPetya is believed to be tied to Russian intelligence, who may have modified the Petya virus to attack Ukraine, and WannaCry may be connected to similar adversarial sectors of the North Korean government.",
              "What do these two malware attacks have in common?",
              "Both were enabled by a Microsoft Windows exploit dubbed Eternalblue, which was first discovered by the National Security Agency.",

              "What did that enigmatic phrase mean?",
              "This was the business card of Creeper, the first computer virus in history, developed by Bob Thomas, a programmer at BBN Technologies.",
              "Although his message was disconcerting, Thomas\u2019s intention was not harmful.",

              "This led not only to the practical confirmation of the ideas already enunciated by John von Neumann in the 1940s, but also to the creation of his nemesis, the first anti-virus in history: Reaper.",

              "In fact, both the concept of virus and the concept of antivirus did not exist at that time (dating back to the 1980s).",
              "However, for those who are not convinced that Creeper was really the first virus, we could speak of the first virus in history, which was also malicious: Rabbit.",
              "Rabbit arrived very shortly after Creeper, in particular after a year, in 1972.",
              "The main difference is that Rabbit reproduced itself on the infected computer, until it invaded the system and caused it to crash.",
              "Years later, some of its successors arrived, such as Elk Cloner, in 1981, which affected the Apple II, and was transmitted through the operating system\u2019s boot diskettes, or BRAIN, the first PC virus, developed in 1986.",
              "The history of BRAIN is interesting, and deserves a small excerpt.",
              "BRAIN was one of the first mass spread viruses (it infected some 20,000 computers at the time, which is no small figure) and was transmitted through the illegal copies of MS-DOS, in order to control them and prevent their spread.",
              "Once inside the system, it would send a message to the user warning them of the infection and providing contact details in order to provide a solution.",
              "The truth is that this small history of viruses and antivirus serves to highlight a fact that we live every day: in the world of computers it is not easy to know what small event could end up becoming a global phenomenon.",
              "The concept developed in an anecdotal and harmless experiment, such as Creeper, ended up perverting itself to the point of giving rise to a problem that affects anyone, and has even generated the creation of millionaire companies, such as antivirus manufacturers, whose main activity consists, precisely, in putting an end to the descendants of the small creeper.",
