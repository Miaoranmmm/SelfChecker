    "query": "What are the key elements and characteristics of successful and innovative leadership, and how can individuals develop these qualities to become effective leaders?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Leadership is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that can be approached from different perspectives and frameworks. However, some common themes emerge when we look at the research and best practices of successful and innovative leaders. Here are some of the key elements and characteristics of such leaders, along with some suggestions on how to develop them:\n\n- **Strategic vision**: Innovative leaders have a clear and compelling vision of the future that inspires and guides their actions. They are able to anticipate and respond to changing market demands, customer needs, and technological trends. They also align their vision with the purpose and values of their organization and communicate it effectively to others[^1^] [^2^]. To develop this skill, you can practice scanning the external environment for opportunities and threats, articulating your vision in a concise and persuasive way, and involving others in co-creating and implementing the vision.\n- **Customer-centric**: Innovative leaders are deeply curious about their customers and seek to understand their problems, preferences, and expectations. They use various methods to gather customer feedback, such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, or observation. They also network with customers and build long-term relationships with them. They use customer insights to design and deliver solutions that create value and delight[^1^] [^2^]. To develop this skill, you can practice asking open-ended questions to your customers, listening actively to their responses, empathizing with their emotions, and using data and evidence to validate your assumptions.\n- **Psychologically safe work environment**: Innovative leaders create a culture of trust, respect, and collaboration among their teams. They encourage experimentation, learning, and feedback. They support their team members to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from them. They also recognize and reward innovation efforts and outcomes[^1^] [^3^]. To develop this skill, you can practice being accessible and approachable to your team members, giving constructive and positive feedback, celebrating successes and failures as learning opportunities, and empowering your team members to make decisions and take ownership of their work.\n- **Optimism**: Innovative leaders have a positive outlook on the future and believe in their own and their team's abilities to overcome challenges and achieve goals. They are resilient in the face of setbacks and failures. They also inspire optimism in others by sharing success stories, expressing confidence, and providing encouragement[^1^]. To develop this skill, you can practice reframing negative situations as opportunities for growth, focusing on solutions rather than problems, acknowledging your strengths and achievements, and seeking support from others when needed.\n- **Great communication**: Innovative leaders are effective communicators who can tailor their messages to different audiences, contexts, and channels. They can articulate their ideas clearly and persuasively, using stories, metaphors, analogies, or visuals. They can also listen attentively to others' ideas, opinions, and feedback. They foster open and honest communication within their teams and across the organization[^2^] [^3^]. To develop this skill, you can practice preparing your messages in advance, using simple and concise language, using appropriate body language and tone of voice, asking for feedback on your communication style, and improving your listening skills.\n- **Openness**: Innovative leaders are open-minded and willing to explore new possibilities",

              "So you know, straight, almost straight off in 2020, we were having to think about leaders and how they were creating that, that new vision in this world of COVID.",

              "And it might just not be sticking.",
              "Jaclynn Robinson 2:42 So today, what we're really here to talk about is, How do we share that vision with employees?",
              "And how do leaders do so in a way that inspires their employees and drives them towards action?",
              "How do we create that sense of hope and inspiration?",
              "So that being said, I'm going to, I'm going to kick it right off and say, 2020 was a rough year.",
              "2021, we still have a lot of work to do.",
              "So Vibhas, how do you inspire employees coming out of this, this level of adversity and change if you are a leader?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 3:12 Yeah, it's interesting, when you, when you think about 2020 and, you know, I, when I was having conversations with a lot of people in 2020, there was a lot of conversation about, you know, just the stroke of midnight on Dec.",
              "31, 2020, things will change and everything will go back to normal.",
              "I really feel that we are kind of, I think we're going through a moment of time rather than a calendar year, so kind of in a shared history.",
              "But when you think about inspiration, it's so important for leaders to be able to inspire and create a clear vision and so on.",
              "The challenge around that is not just 2020.",
              "In fact, even before that, our research shows that there have been a lot of issues.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 3:52 So I think we did some research, even prepandemic and pre-2020 around how inspired do employees feel?",
              "So in our research, we saw that only about I think about 13% actually said, \"I strongly agree that the leadership communicates effectively to me,\" or I think it was lower, about one in 10 who said that, you know, \"The organization and the leaders make me feel enthusiastic about the future.\"",
              "So I think it's an issue that spans a larger time than just 2020.",
              "But I think the importance of creating a clear vision, an inspiring vision, and a purpose statement in kind of reconnecting people with why they're in business for -- what is the purpose of the organization becomes all the more important.",
              "Jaclynn Robinson 4:35 Yeah, that's so true.",
              "And, and we've been seeing that even this, this past year.",
              "This past year, even leading into January, speaking with organizations are really struggling with creating that, that level of inspiration.",
              "And they might have found a way to do so a little bit during COVID-19.",
              "And they were really clear with communication.",
              "But now we're just getting back to that stage where it's, you know, how do I keep it going.",
              "If I'm, if I'm not clear on what 2021 looks like, how do I create that that inspiration for them?",
              "How do I put that strategic narrative in place?",
              "So what is it that Gallup's research says that inspira -- what is it that Gallup's research says about what inspirational leaders do (apologies there)?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 5:16 Yeah, no, I think it's interesting.",
              "So we've done, of course, a lot of research around leadership.",
              "So we did, a, recently, a few years ago, kind of did a, what we call a meta-analysis of competencies.",
              "So essentially, look at all competencies and what's out there.",
              "We did our own research, more than 550 research studies to try to understand, well, what, what are the key competencies of leaders?",
              "And it's interesting, we came up with 7 key competencies.",
              "Now when I look at those 7 competencies, 3 out of those 7 competencies have to do directly with inspiration.",
              "So these are things like inspire others, communicate clearly and lead change.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 5:50 When you think about the job of leadership, I think I strongly believe it's inspiration.",
              "That's a big part of what you're expected to do as a leader.",
              "I'm always reminded of this quote, \"Leaders are dealers of hope.\"",
              "Napoleon Bonaparte said that, interestingly.",
              "So when you think about what a leader is expected to do, and how you're expected to communicate, it's kind of interesting.",
              "You sometimes think of inspiration as charisma, or extroversion.",
              "When you think about great inspiring leaders, it's Steve Jobs, and you know, how he communicated and so on.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 6:25 It was very interesting.",
              "I use this example a lot.",
              "You know, when Steve Jobs was asked this question, like, \"What is the purpose, what is the vision of Apple?\"",
              "He said, \"To create a dent in the universe.\"",
              "And when you, when you think about that, wow, you know, like, that's really inspiring.",
              "But then you think about, well, what do I do to create a dent in the universe?",
              "What are the specifics we want?",
              "So in his leave of absence, when Steve Jobs was unwell, and Tim Cook take -- took over, Tim Cook was asked the same question.",
              "And his response was a 700-word description of what the purpose of the organization is.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 7:01 So I really think great leaders, when it comes to inspiration, strike that balance between inspiration and clarity, inspiration and performance.",
              "So, and I think that's what people are looking for in a very disruptive environment.",
              "It's not just great words, and, you know, \"We're gonna get out of this,\" you know, \"We're gonna progress forward.\"",
              "But tell me clearly what the future looks like.",
              "Tell me the role I play.",
              "I think that balance -- great leaders strike that balance between inspiration and performance.",
              "Jim Collison 7:30 Vibhas, we're coming off of a year that leaders are exhausted.",
              "Right, they are.",
              "Can you give a few words around, I mean, I, it's great to think about, \"We have to be leaders that inspire.\"",
              "Many of them are in damage control.",
              "They're tired.",
              "So what would we say, what does our data say?",
              "Or what can we think about, How do we get them back?",
              "Like, how do we inspire those that need to inspire?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 7:52 Yeah, yeah.",
              "And engagement, as you know, we've been tracking it for a fairly long time.",
              "And the recent readout we did, we did say that after a historic high on employee engagement, in the peak of the crisis, we're starting to see things kind of turn back to normal.",
              "One of the kind of sharpest declines we're seeing is actually for leaders and managers.",
              "So you're right, Jim, I think there is a certain amount of COVID fatigue here.",
              "But just in my work with executive teams, one of the key things that is coming up is the need for alignment around what the future looks like.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 8:22 During the pandemic, in the peak of the pandemic, I think, there was heightened agility and kind of newfound agility and great communication and all of that, and great examples of leaders communicating.",
              "I think the key focus is going to be what, which of those fantastic behaviors are going to are you going to take into 2021?",
              "I'm seeing kind of things kind of balancing out now.",
              "You know, all that communication was great.",
              "But then slowly, even when you do focus-group discussions with our clients, there's, there's not, there's less communication, there's less clarity going into 2021.",
              "So I would say, prioritization has to be the leadership team in terms of how they are aligned.",
              "They were aligned in 2020.",
              "How will they continue to be aligned going forward, when they're going to be able to, when they're going to be making important decisions about what the future looks like?",
              "That's where the vision comes in also, in terms of clarity and having a vision that's compelling for everyone.",
              "Jaclynn Robinson 9:19 From the, the physical wellbeing side, this is something, Jim, you and I talked about last year, just in terms of How do we get people woken up and warmed up?",
              "How do we inspire them?",
              "And it's, Get outside too, go, go walk, think through what's inspired you in this last year, how you've been able to create some, some creativity out of the adversity.",
              "Get that thought process brewing, so that when you go back into the office, whether it's your home office or you're working on-site, you're reenergized.",
              "And that's really helping you think about how you want to then take what's inspiring you or that passion you have to translate it down.",
              "Even more specifically, to the managers that they're going to be working with, How does each manager who's running each of these departments translate what they're doing down to the employees?",
              "But getting out and getting outside, what a difference that can make just to give someone a little bit of that extra pep in their step to get the noodle brewing.",
              "Jim Collison 10:15 Yeah.",
              "Vibhas, you alluded to this just a second ago, but John Sexton in the chat room says, What strategies do you see from executives/organizational leaders who seem to be navigating our present environment well?",
              "Again, you alluded to this as far as the communication bit.",
              "What stands out in, in terms of their approach?",
              "What are we seeing that had worked well that may translate then into this next phase of recovery?",
              "Jaclynn Robinson 10:38 It's a great question.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 10:39 Great question.",
              "Yeah, a couple of things that kind of stand out, at least in my work with executive teams, is one is kind of reconnecting with the purpose of the organization and, and in a more meaningful way than just words on the wall.",
              "You know, I think every organization has a purpose statement, and every organization has a vision statement.",
              "What is interesting is that a lot of organizations are redrawing their vision statements because of the disruption of 2020.",
              "You know, are, are elements of your vision, do they need to change?",
              "Because -- and remember, purpose is timeless;",
              "vision is time-bound.",
              "So essentially, vision is a little bit more dynamic than purpose is.",
              "You don't change your purpose all the time;",
              "it's why you exist.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 11:17 But what I'm seeing a lot of leaders do is getting clarity around what the purpose and the way forward is, communicating in a way that is inspiring.",
              "And when I say that, it's not just, you know, standing in a town hall meeting and, you know, going through your profit and loss and your EBITDA and your, you know, all those financial terms, but real stories of heroics.",
              "You know, I've worked with a lot of healthcare companies.",
              "And if you think about the kind of heroics people have seen, those stories are the ones that are more powerful than a chart with P & L ratios.",
              "So I think that, that, that switch you need to make to creating inspiration, not just as a leader inspiring, but stories of inspiration.",
              "I think that's, that's really important.",
              "So I think that's one.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 12:01 In healthcare, I, I read about this hospital where they did huddles in the morning.",
              "And instead of just calling them huddles, they called them \"hope huddles,\" where instead of talking about how many people went on ventilators, they talked about how many people went off ventilators.",
              "You know, that's such an appreciative way of looking at it.",
              "So that kind of inspiration and stories of inspiration, I think that's one.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 12:26 The other is, the second one is really behaviors.",
              "You know, it's just, going into 2021 and the, and the future, let's be very clear about what are the behaviors and principles that will drive performance.",
              "And I think that's what, and, and going back to 2020, all the agility I talked about, those were behaviors.",
              "And every executive team I talk to, they talk about how great it was, and how the team rallied, and so on.",
              "Write down those behaviors, really, and, and think about what you need to do as leaders to keep focusing on those behaviors in the future.",
              "So I think I would call it I mean, you can call it \"purpose and principles.\"",
              "Get your purpose right, communicate it in a really powerful way, in an inspiring way.",
              "And get those principles that made you successful, and ensure that they keep driving them in the future.",
              "Jaclynn Robinson 13:18 One thing I wrote down as you were talking was the stories of inspiration.",
              "And as we think about the, the number of coaches that we have today and that will be listening in and as executive coaches ourselves, one of the coaching questions that came to mind for me is asking leaders, \"Describe a moment of inspiration that you've had in the last week.\"",
              "I'd also love to hear from you, What are some great coaching questions that you like to ask leaders to help them really get practical and think about these moments of inspiration, these stories, best practices that they've, that they've experienced -- to get their head out of the weeds and into that, that level of positive thinking?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 13:55 Great question, Jaclynn.",
              "And, you know, I'm a lifelong student of appreciative inquiry.",
              "It's something that I've built all my work around for the past 20 years.",
              "And, and I work with Diane Whitney, who's kind of the cocreators of appreciative inquiry have been claimed by her.",
              "I think a lot of those questions that we need to put in play as leaders are appreciative questions.",
              "So rather than deficit-based questions about what went wrong, rather than a root-cause analysis of failure, it should be a root-cause analysis of success.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 14:24 So some of the great questions are like, Tell me about a high-point experience out of 2020?",
              "You know, you automatically, when you think about 2020, it's Hey, a lot went wrong.",
              "But no, but there's a lot that went right.",
              "You know, so tell me!",
              "Give me a story about a high-point experience.",
              "Tell me what you valued about 2020 the most.",
              "You know, I mean, those questions are fantastic questions.",
              "And what I like about them is they're solutions-focused.",
              "You're saying, Well, what happened that made that difference, and how can you -- positive image is equal to positive action, right?",
              "Jaclynn Robinson 14:57 Yes.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 14:58 So that's the thing.",
              "if you keep focusing on problems and what happened, you know, you'll find more problems. If you focus on solutions, you'll find more solutions.",
              "So I think the, for coaches, that conversation and the kind of questions you use are more strengths-based.",
              "And when we talk about strengths, we talk about individual strengths.",
              "A lot of us as StrengthsFinder coaches think about organizational strengths.",
              "In appreciative inquiry, they call it the \"positive core.\"",
              "So what's the positive core of the organization?",
              "And that, that is what is resilient.",
              "That is what will take the leaders and organizations into the future.",
              "I highly recommend appreciative questions.",
              "Jaclynn Robinson 15:31 That's such a -- I love that, because now, at that organizationwide level, we're thinking, What have you all done as an organization in 2020 that moved the company forward?",
              "Or What are you proud of that you did as an organization in 2020?",
              "So I love that idea of high-level.",
              "We're not just thinking about individuals at this point, but with leaders, they are thinking more organizationwide, macro-level, and those questions really tap into it.",
              "What a perfect combo to take appreciative inquiry alongside CliftonStrengths and strengths coaching, it's just, they pair so well together.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 16:06 Yeah, and there is so much, there's so much synergy between these approaches, and not, not just appreciative inquiry.",
              "And some of you as coaches are familiar with the solutions-focused approach, or solutions-based coaching, all of that stuff, I think it all aligns really, really well.",
              "So when you think about appreciative leadership or appreciative team-building, and everything Gallup knows about recognition, and the power of recognition, this is when we need it the most.",
              "This is the year we, 2021 has to be the the year of appreciation, and recognition and acknowledgment more than any other year.",
              "Jim Collison 16:42 That, I think that's so well said, in the sense if you ever want to, you know, if the battery's dead, you jump-start it with recognition.",
              "And I think if a culture is dead, a corporate culture is struggling (let's not call it dead, because that, that's not, that's not positive), but if it's really, really struggling, to give it a boost, I think that recognition piece can kick in and do that.",
              "Vibhas, a question from the chat room, though, I think that's important.",
              "It says, when you mention clarity, do you mean looking back at your successes and failures and working towards the future with hindsight?",
              "Doesn't hindsight limit vision at times?",
              "And as we look at 2020, it's a special year.",
              "So talk a little bit about that.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 17:20 Hindsight is not 2020, right?",
              "It's -- really think about that in retrospect.",
              "It's, yeah, when I say \"clarity,\" you know, it's, it's not about letting employees know every, every individual aspect of your strategy, but giving them enough information so that they know that what they do and their role connects to the vision and the purpose of the company.",
              "And I call it personalizing your purpose, or personalizing the purpose of an organization.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 17:48 You know, the question we ask on our Q12 engagement survey is, \"The mission or purpose of my company makes me feel my job is important.\"",
              "And I think there's a, there's a need, there's a reason why we say \"makes me feel my job is important,\" because that's what it is.",
              "How do I connect what I do to the purpose and the vision of the organization?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 18:04 An idea there is this whole concept of what's called a \"strategic narrative.\"",
              "You know, I mean, I think it's kind of moving away from, Hey, what is the vision of the organization?",
              "But I think of the strategic narrative as vision and purpose on a journey.",
              "And, in fact, when you think about visioning our lives think about it as not what we will become, but what we are becoming.",
              "Because it's a journey, you're, you know, you're not just vision, you're moving towards that;",
              "it's a process.",
              "So I think more and more, what employees want to know is not the outcome, but the journey.",
              "What, what is the path we're taking?",
              "And then creating a lot of confidence around the path or multiple paths we're taking, you know, because you know what, you don't know what 2021 will throw at us.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 18:50 But people want that level of, you know, I mean, you know, the 4 Needs of Followers: you know, trust, stability, compassion and hope.",
              "When it comes to trust and stability, tell me enough about where we are coming from, where we are and where we are going to give me the confidence that what I'm doing, what I'm contributing, is in the right direction.",
              "So that whole point about bringing purpose down to the front line is so important.",
              "Jaclynn Robinson 19:15 And that ties right back into what Jim was mentioning earlier about the value of recognition.",
              "People want to know that they're creating value and that they're, they're doing something that's connected to the, the purpose or mission of the organization.",
              "But if they're not getting that recognition, they don't know if they're valued, they don't know if what they're doing matters, they don't know if the work they're doing is even excellent.",
              "So that, that recognition piece, I think, can support managers and leaders as they think about helping other people see how they're creating that -- what I like to call the purposeful productivity that is geared towards the mission of the organization.",
              "Vibhas, do you, speaking of strategic narrative, do you have some examples of strategic narrative and what that looks like?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 19:58 Yeah, I mean, there's so many, and they tend to be very individualized.",
              "So Microsoft has one, and it's, Microsoft has a purpose statement.",
              "But they also have a narrative, which is a little longer.",
              "And again, that's the kind of the shared understanding.",
              "I love the word \"shared vision.\"",
              "When you say vision, it's always like, Hey, it's the company's vision.",
              "And there's a little bit of kind of alienation there, like, Oh, it's the company's vision.",
              "But you know, how much ownership do you have in vision?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 20:24 So Chipotle has a wonderful one.",
              "And you can, you can just go on their website because they put the strategic narrative or the narrative on their website.",
              "But I think the point here is you need a narrative that builds on your purpose, that builds on your vision, which is not just your purpose, but it's the description of your purpose, and what that will look like in the future.",
              "And I really think it creates that clear path for employees.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 20:48 So when I work with leaders around creating a strategic narrative, I make sure that they include a couple of things.",
              "You know, it's, Is there a role for employees in that purpose statement?",
              "Now, when you say, here's where the vision of the organization or the purpose, here's the context for change, here's what we're doing and here's where we change.",
              "Here's a role that you play as an employee.",
              "Now, that's a great, that's a great narrative, because a purpose by itself, the statement by itself, think about, GE [U.",
              "S.",
              "-based company General Electric].",
              "When you think about GE's purpose, it's to bring good things to life.",

              "But what does it mean for me?",
              "What does it mean for me today and this year, you know?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 21:31 So the narrative is a really good way of kind of, you know, when you think about Martin Luther King (and it's Martin Luther King Day on Monday), when you think about is the \"I Have a Dream\" speech, that's a powerful narrative.",
              "It's connecting, it's not just I, you know, I have a dream, but it's the context of his, what he said, and how it connected with people.",
              "I think leaders got to do more of that.",
              "I think leaders and teams, executive teams need to come together and create that narrative that creates that clear pathway that cuts through all the noise and off 2020 and 2021.",

              "Jim Collison 22:13 Vibhas, Lisa's asking in the chat room, can you give a specific example, as you think about a leader -- and, you know, we'll change the names to protect the innocent in this, maybe -- but any specific examples are you thinking in your work, where we, you've worked with a leader to do something like this?",
              "And how did you approach that as a coach?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 22:31 Yeah, so let me give you a mem -- I'm going to try to, you know, blank out any kind of client kind of -- but this is a, this is interesting, this is actually a, an organization I worked with on the East Coast.",
              "And, and they really are an engineering company, and full of engineers.",
              "You know, and they were kind of coming together to kind of put together a vision statement and a purpose statement and a set of clear values.",
              "So we worked with them for a fairly long time on that.",
              "But when you think about this company, they actually create products and components that go in a space shuttle.",
              "So you can imagine the level of sophistication and high tech involved there.",
              "And leaders are a bunch of engineers.",
              "And the big, big issue there was, Do they really get the soft stuff, you know, like this vision and purpose?",
              "And it's too superficial, and so on.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 23:26 Well it's interesting, we started off by giving all the leaders, and there were about, actually 30 of them.",
              "We gave them a bunch of questions, appreciative questions, right?",
              "What do you value the most?",
              "And so on.",
              "We said, Go and interview your people about what the, what the future should look like, and so on.",
              "And it was interesting, that act itself was kicking, was, was kicking off the process of change.",
              "Because when you ask, the ask -- the act of asking a question itself is change.",
              "So they were asking these questions, they were actually learning a lot.",
              "So it's not Gallup going in there and doing a bunch of interviews, which we do for some consulting work we do.",
              "But it was the leaders asking those questions.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 24:05 When they came back, this group of engineers -- and you could imagine the room, the positive energy in the room was tremendous, because they were saying, OK, what's possible?",
              "So, where they were saying, Well, the vision of the organization is our technical expertise, and I will drive it, it morphed into, it morphed into nation-building, and the contribution we make.",
              "It's that big purpose statement that they came up with around changing the world, essentially.",
              "So I think that's, that's interesting, because you're now going into a narrative rather than a statement.",
              "I don't know whether this fits the bill, Jim, but i think that's, that's what it is, you know, using positive inquiry to create a positive outcome, and then communicating it in a credible, clear and compelling way to employees is key.",
              "Jim Collison 24:54 No, I think it's a, I think it's a great example.",
              "Let me bring this in as well.",
              "So Adrian says, I've been spending time with my clients doing exercises around being agile in this moment, these moments of ambiguity.",
              "Love to hear your thoughts as we think about agility into this, in what you've been talking about, what is the role of being agile in this area of leadership?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 25:18 I mean, agility is, is incredibly important.",
              "And it's also a buzzword.",
              "Everybody's talking about agility.",
              "And, you know, and then when you think about agility, you think about Scrum teams and Scrum masters and the whole process around it.",
              "I think Gallup's view is very clear: Agility is not just process, it's also mindset.",
              "So it's process and mindset.",
              "I define agility is as \"adaptability plus speed plus execution.\"",
              "I think that's important because it's not just, yeah, it's not just pace;",
              "it's also the ability to pivot.",
              "And at the end of the day, flawless execution;",
              "you can't be agile if you don't execute.",
              "But when I work with organizations around agility -- adaptability, speed, and execution -- I want, I want examples of that.",
              "I want stories.",
              "I want to know where this worked at its best.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 26:06 So when we work with organizations around driving agile behaviors, we start with these three.",
              "We frame some important questions around these.",
              "And we ask leaders to go and find out, you know, examples of these and come back to us.",
              "And just that because, you know, it moves away from being, Hey, agility as a buzzword to an important shift in mindset.",
              "And, and really, again, going back to recognition, acknowledgment of where we are adaptable.",
              "Because you know, human beings are, I think, wired to always kind of automatically look at the negative aspect and the deficit-based mindset.",
              "Whenever you make that pivot and you make that shift to a positive-inquiry mindset, I think that changes a lot.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 26:46 So I think agility is important.",
              "Execution is even more important.",
              "And the behaviors, the Agile behaviors that we've demonstrated during 2020, 2021 will be a very different year.",
              "And those same behaviors might not necessarily operate.",
              "But a question I always ask leaders is, Did it really take a crisis for you to be agile?",
              "And that's what it seems to be the case, you know, like, \"Oh, yeah, we were, we were fantastic.",
              "We were agile.\"",
              "Why?",
              "Because there was a pandemic.",
              "Why can't you be agile by design?",
              "You know, and I think this kind of positive inquiry kind of creates that agility in definition, rather than just as a concept.",
              "Jaclynn Robinson 27:27 What I love about what you've been saying over the last few minutes, too, is this, this really takes us back to that shared-vision piece.",
              "It can't be a shared vision if they're not going back and they're asking employees for their thoughts and opinions.",
              "And what have we done well?",
              "And, you know, I'm just hearing that from you.",
              "So it's the leader creating this vision, but the way that it's becoming a shared vision is by asking these questions.",
              "In these examples that you've provided, they're going back to the employees, and the employees are really excited about that, too.",
              "It sounds like, you know, their, their opinions feel like they count;",
              "they feel valued.",
              "And we know for taking that strengths-based approach and leading with appreciative inquiry that's going to increase their engagement if we're starting to talk about things that inspire, things that they've done well.",

              "I think it's, it's talking about strengths and engagement, which then leads us into wellbeing -- which we know everyone is focused on this year is, How do we enhance the wellbeing of not just our leadership but of our employee base as well?",
              "They're really hurting.",
              "It can start with appreciative inquiry and thinking about that vision, how do we inspire through the vision?",

              "Vibhas Ratanjee 28:48 Yeah, I mean, absolutely not!",
              "You can inspire away, but, you know, at the end of the day, as I said, adaptability, speed and execution, at the end of the day, the focus has to be on, on performance, for sure.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 29:03 But you know, sometimes when you think about performance, you think about motivation.",
              "And there's a difference between inspiration and motivation, you know.",
              "When you think about motivation, it's you're motivated to do something.",
              "And it's usually, and you can motivate people by creating an environment and so on.",
              "I think inspiration is intrinsic.",
              "It's, it's me, and it's what I'm inspired to do.",
              "It's inside, in many ways.",
              "I think, and realizing that they're two different things is going to be very important.",
              "And that's where inspiration comes from communication.",
              "That's when the job of leadership is really inspiring others, right?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 29:37 Job, the job of managers is also to inspire.",

              "What are some maybe coaching questions that you would hand leaders or suggest to leaders that they could ask managers that taps into inspiration and performance?",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 30:47 Yeah, I mean, some of the questions that actually in some of our courses are fantastic as well, you know, and I remember the old -- and how many people would remember this -- with the 4 Keys of Management that Gallup kind of came up with, questions like, What do you expect to me this year?",

              "But when it comes to one-on-one conversations, understanding the strengths of an individual, their motivations and beliefs, what they value, that is also kind of really important, in terms of inspiration.",

              "So, you know, being able to kind of, so a lot of Indian leaders and a lot of other Asian leaders that I worked with, and a lot of foreign leaders or Western leaders that I worked with, one of the things I coached them on was, Go slow.",
              "You know, when you're talking about the vision of the organization, you got to take pauses, you got to, you know, slow down and ensure that there is understanding.",
              "Because what tends to happen in Asia, for instance, is that people will not tell you or ask you a question that they didn't understand this vision, this grand vision that you communicate it to them.",
              "So you need to go and check in.",
              "You need to, you know, ask questions, you need to almost individualize and regionalize, you know, what you're talking about.",
              "You need to know a little bit about their language.",
              "Vibhas Ratanjee 34:23 And that level of curiosity the leaders need to have in a global environment, and I, and that's -- loosely I call that's the global mindset, right -- I think that's very important.",

              "So I think leaders need to operate at both those levels: you know, that 300 -- 30,000-feet level, How do I inspire?",
              "And then follow-ups where the, you know, I want to know who you are, I want to know your background and your beliefs, and so on.",

              "These surveys won\u2019t be connected to a specific milestone or touchpoint, but they will give you feedback on your customers\u2019 overall opinions about your company.",

              "You\u2019ll want to keep your survey questions simple and concise.",

              "Due to budget and logistics, they are generally done on a small scale.",

              "In addition, more companies today are building adjacent and new-frontier business models to serve as growth engines.",
              "Bridgestone, for instance, acquired TomTom Telematics so it could offer new integrated business models such as tires as a service and predictive fleet maintenance.",
              "In many cases, M&A may be necessary to add or scale up such capabilities quickly.",
              "Relatively few companies are undertaking a full reinvention of their current core business model.",
              "Netflix\u2019s transition from renting DVDs to operating the world\u2019s largest streaming video subscription service and Microsoft\u2019s shift from selling software to positioning itself as a cloud-based provider of software as a service are two well-known examples that showcase both the extent of disruption to their previous business models and the rewards of success.",
              "BCG research indicates that some 80% of consumer-facing companies use only the most basic customer insight tools.",
              "Although many companies invest significantly in conducting consumer research or tracking consumers\u2019 behavior over time, they may lack the capacity to move from data to insights and then to action.",
              "Leading companies use novel customer insight and market segmentation approaches such as demand-centric growth (DCG) to understand emerging or untapped customer needs, identify and size growth and expansion opportunities, and prioritize innovations that have the highest ROI.",
              "One critical feature of these approaches is that they help companies better understand not only what, when, and where customers want to buy, but also why they want to buy\u2014information that is critical to identifying key opportunities and potential hurdles in the innovation process.",
              "Before the pandemic, Hilton used a combination of DCG and customer insights to reorient its brand portfolio, leading to significant growth and contributing to a gain of almost $14 billion when the company\u2019s sale was completed in 2018 (one of the most profitable private equity deals ever).",
              "After analyzing the evolving hotel landscape and shifts in customer preferences (including the influence of new competitors such as Airbnb), Hilton identified the untapped opportunities in its portfolio and launched Tru by Hilton, a new brand.",
              "Tru by Hilton addressed an underserved customer need to \u201cget in and get out,\u201d combining lower operating costs (free coffee but no free breakfast) and lower capital costs (no front desk or pool, and rooms with smaller bathrooms).",
              "To trigger these kinds of successes, the customer insight function must have effective tools, but it also requires elevation to the status of a true strategic insight partner on innovation.",
              "Too often today, the primary role that customer insight plays is that of input provider.",
              "One reason for this situation may be that, according to BCG research, two-thirds of all organizations have not perceived their CEO as truly championing customer insight\u2014often to the surprise of the CEO.",
              "Converting insights into winning formulas isn\u2019t the result of one-off efforts but rather of a systematic approach to experimentation and innovation.",
              "The most successful CEOs embed insight-based innovation in their company\u2019s culture, in its ways of working, in its organizational design, and in its leadership model.",
              "By doing so, they push innovation to frontline teams across their business and empower those teams to identify and remove sources of friction for customers.",
              "They make everyday innovation a source of competitive advantage.",
              "At the heart of this approach is a concept we call the innovation flywheel\u2014the insight-based learning loop that powers everyday innovation.",
              "(See the exhibit.)",
              "It takes as its premise the idea that the more you know about your customers, the more opportunity you have to innovate on their behalf.",
              "Every interaction with an end user (customer or employee) produces information and data\u2014both qualitative and quantitative\u2014that generates insights into where and how new value can be created.",
              "This in turn drives the next round of innovation, which achieves deeper engagement with the end user.",
              "This process creates a virtuous cycle that, once in motion, generates greater engagement and new insights.",
              "Companies have to exert substantial energy to get the flywheel spinning because at the outset they must overcome structural barriers such as organizational and incentive misalignment, sluggish decision making, and brittle legacy systems. The effort entails challenging existing paradigms, breaking organizational silos, and enabling true collaboration on shared goals by cross-functional teams\u2014all of which require sustained leadership from the CEO.",
              "Once the process takes hold, however, it generates enormous energy and creates a self-reinforcing loop that attracts new talent, promotes a maker culture, and drives change from the inside out.",
              "Our recent article provides an insider\u2019s view of the innovation flywheel in action and examines the dramatic impact it is having at companies in multiple industries.",
              "The year 2020 put to rest any remaining doubts about the value of digital processes and value propositions.",
              "Digital transformation of the core business is now a top priority for 75% of CEOs, and 65% of firms are doubling down on their plans for transformation with renewed urgency.",
              "One big benefit of digital is its ability to turbocharge innovation and create competitive advantage through new products, services, and business models.",
              "Companies face a major challenge in this regard, however: our research shows that most digital transformations fail to deliver the desired results.",
              "BCG recently identified six success factors that together\u2014and only together\u2014flip the odds of digital transformation success from 30% to 80%.",
              "Those six success factors are close integration of digital strategy with the business strategy, commitment from the CEO through middle management, a talent core of digital superstars, business-led and flexible technology and data platforms, agile governance, and effective monitoring of progress toward defined outcomes.",
              "Bringing together all six factors is essential to becoming an innovative organization in the digital age.",
              "(You can take a quick online self-assessment of your organization\u2019s likelihood of success in digital transformation here.)",
              "Organizations don\u2019t change overnight.",
              "Transforming leadership, culture, talent, governance, and technology takes time.",
              "One approach to assembling the key success factors described above is to embed a microcosm of the desired future-state organization into teams that are driving frontline change.",
              "As the number of such teams increases across the company, change occurs iteratively and continuously.",
              "We describe this as taking an MVP/MVO (minimum viable product/minimum viable organization) approach.",
              "Every innovative MVP that the company produces creates a surrounding MVO.",
              "In practical terms, this means putting just enough of the right components\u2014leadership behavior, culture, talent, new ways of working, governance, processes, and tech\u2014in place to enable the MVP to thrive.",
              "Successful companies follow this organic approach to transformation by starting small (but thinking big), learning by building, and setting the first flywheel in motion by surrounding it with the MVO it needs to sustainably succeed.",
              "Just as an MVP is a test-and-learn proof point for a new offering, an MVO serves as a proof point for the power of a more digital-, agile-, and innovation-first organization\u2014what we call the Bionic Company.",
              "As MVPs proliferate, so do MVOs, until the organization reaches the necessary tipping point to rewire itself and ensure that the change sticks.",
              "National Grid, a leading utility, scaled up the flywheel and implemented the MVO change model by identifying value pools along its value chain and then launching innovation sprints to target each opportunity area with digital solutions and products.",
              "The utility has now launched its first wave of digital solutions.",
              "One is a field-force enablement platform that radically streamlines network repair and maintenance operations by putting the line worker, supervisor, and clerk at the center of the flywheel innovation cycle.",
              "Teams are rapidly adopting this approach across field service operations, and early results show that doing so reduces the average closure window for a field repair job from 77 days to 48 hours.",
              "National Grid now has more than eight flywheel teams in flight, exposing more than 200 employees to the flywheel approach.",
              "The utility\u2019s goal is to have more than 25 fully operational flywheel teams in place by the end of 2021.",
              "BCG research has found that 65% of companies today work with startups or new ventures.",
              "For this purpose, they have set up innovation vehicles of one or more types\u2014such as corporate venture capital (CVC) funds, accelerators, incubators, or open innovation units.",
              "But 45% of such companies have expressed dissatisfaction with the results of their efforts, because the programs have not delivered meaningful impact for them.",
              "In our experience, three factors are key to unlocking significant impact from corporate venturing.",
              "The first is to define a clear mandate for the corporate venturing program and the required innovation vehicles.",
              "Relevant criteria include the anticipated contribution to the parent\u2019s growth ambition, the role of the program within the overall innovation agenda, and the ways in which the chosen vehicles complement R&D and M&A in the strategic objective\u2014such as in building a new vertical or gaining access to new technologies.",
              "The second factor is to rigorously determine a budget allocation for each vehicle as part of the overall R&D budget allocation\u2014even in difficult times\u2014to avoid hobbling efforts to get innovations off the ground.",
              "The third is to ensure establishment of a link to the strategic competitive advantage of the parent company, such as its capabilities, market access, and existing customer base.",
              "This requires setting the right governance and incentives as well as ensuring buy-in from senior business leaders.",
              "We worked recently with a leading consumer appliance manufacturer that historically had focused on its core business and powerful technology and R&D capabilities.",
              "The board wanted to significantly increase revenues outside the core.",
              "To leverage its technology and R&D capabilities, it established a dedicated business-building unit with a clear mandate to create or buy scalable businesses in adjacencies.",
              "In line with the factors described above, this approach had three critical components.",
              "The first was end-to-end responsibility to grow the businesses by applying strategic partnering, M&A, incubation, minority investments, and co-creation.",
              "The second was appropriate ring-fenced funding to achieve the growth ambition.",
              "The third was access to the core business\u2019s technology, R&D, marketing, and sales capabilities.",
              "The guiding principle was to systematically leverage the firm\u2019s strategic advantages and to de-risk and scale the new businesses.",
              "Innovation creates long-term value and builds resilience in the face of crisis.",
              "But it requires active leadership from the top.",
              "Our research shows that executive teams at innovation leaders engage in this process far beyond merely setting the agenda and holding people accountable.",
              "They also elevate customer insight, actively manage the portfolio, and personally engage with innovation teams. Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s CEO, has stated, \u201cThe purpose of our leadership team is to bring clarity, alignment, and intensity.",

              "In short, resilience is not something we need to find deep down inside ourselves: we can actually become more resilient in the process of connecting with others in our most challenging times.",
              "Based on in-depth interviews with 150 leaders (five men and five women from 15 different organizations who were considered to be among their \u201cmost successful\u201d leaders), we have defined how connections can help us become more resilient when we encounter major life or professional challenges.",
              "A well-developed network of relationships can help us rebound from setbacks by: As Jacob (who was among those we interviewed) learned in what was unquestionably the toughest period of his entire career, resilience is a team sport.",
              "While, clearly, a portion of Jacob\u2019s fortitude came from personal strength, our discussion with him revealed a number of ways that relationships bolstered his resilience.",

              "\u201cShe always made herself available and these interactions helped me quit worrying endlessly about different decisions.",
              "\u201d In addition, he tapped into the strong working relationship he had with another department head to jointly manage surges in workload.",
              "The resources he was able to \u201cborrow\u201d from this colleague enabled him to push back on non-essential work, as well as bypass typical bureaucratic gridlock to secure resources.",

              "\u201d Even his daily exchanges with his office manager played a critical role \u2014 she was able to find ways to laugh with him even under this stress.",
              "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t gallows humor, but sarcastic comments about difficult people or situations that lightened things for us and made us feel on the same team,\u201d he recalled.",

              "They would tell me this, and it was better than anything else to help me buckle down and keep pushing through.",
              "\u201d In short, Jacob shows us that resilience is found not just in having a network of supporters, but in truly connecting with them when you need them most.",
              "It\u2019s in the actual interactions themselves \u2014 the conversations that validate your plans, reframe your perspective on a situation, help you laugh and feel authentic with others, or just encourage you to get back up and try again because the battle is a worthy one \u2014 that we become resilient.",
              "Yes, we\u2019re all told to build a network to help further our careers, but what\u2019s important to understand is how essential these relationships can also be to our day-to-day emotional well-being \u2014 if we are building these relationships in the right way as we progress through our careers.",
              "Relationships may be our most undervalued resources.",
              "But such a network won\u2019t materialize overnight.",
              "When we talk to people who have shown exceptional resilience, it\u2019s clear that they often have cultivated and maintained authentic connections that come from many parts of their life \u2014 not only through work, but through athletic pursuits, volunteer work, civic or religious communities, book or dinner clubs, communities of parents they\u2019ve met through their children, and so on.",
              "Interactions in these spheres provide critical \u201cdimensionality\u201d, broadening their identity and \u201copening the aperture\u201d on how they look at their lives.",

              "Here\u2019s an exercise to help you think that through.",
              "Below are eight common relational sources of resilience, the same ones we noted above.",
              "Our research shows that these sources are not universally or equally important to everyone.",
              "For example, some people value laughter, while others prefer empathy.",
              "In short, our resilience needs are personal and are shaped by our unique history, personality, and professional/personal context.",
              "But collectively, the relationships we develop are a toolbox that we can turn to in our most difficult times, which we can rely upon to help us navigate day-to-day life challenges.",
              "Using the framework below, identify the top three sources of resilience that you would most like to strengthen in your life.",
              "Make a note of those that are most important for you to work on developing.",
              "Reflecting on the top three resilience needs you indicated, place the names of people or groups that you could invest in to further cultivate sources of resilience.",
              "Connections that yield resilience can be intentionally cultivated in two ways.",
              "First, we can broaden existing relationships by, for example, exploring non-work interests with a teammate or strengthening mutually beneficial relationships with influential work colleagues that help us push back.",
              "Second, we can initiate engagement with new groups or people to cultivate important elements of resilience \u2014 for example spiritual groups that remind us of our purpose, or affinity groups that allow us to laugh.",
              "Broadening our network helps us develop dimensionality in our lives \u2014 a rich variety of relationships and connections that help us grow, that can provide perspective on our struggles, and that can offer us a stronger sense of purpose.",
              "These groups may come from any and all walks of life \u2014 athletic pursuits, spiritual associations, nonprofit board work, community organizing groups around social, environmental, or political issues, etc.",
              "Engaging in nonwork groups (particularly board work, social action, and community organizing groups) helps us develop resilience in our work life as well.",
              "Exposure to a diverse group of people allows us to learn different ways of managing, leading, and handling crises, and helps us develop different relational skills such as negotiating with various stakeholders.",
              "It also helps us cultivate empathy and perspective that we carry back into our work, among other benefits.",
              "In summary, meaningful investment in non-work relationships broadens the toolkit one can rely upon to manage setbacks when they arise.",
              "One critical insight from our interviews is that relying on your network in times of transition matters a great deal.",
              "When people told us stories of significant transitions \u2014 moves, job losses, role expansions, or family changes \u2014 they tended to separate into one of two groups.",
              "One group tended to lean into the transition and relied on existing relationships to work through the ambiguity and anxiety they were experiencing.",
              "This group also used the transition to reach out to one or two new groups such as a working parents group, a newcomers group, or a work-based coaching circle.",
              "In contrast, the second group operated with a mindset that they just needed to absorb the transition and closed in on their circle.",
              "They felt overwhelmed and said they would lean into activities when they had time in the future.",
              "Over the ensuing 18 months, this group became a smaller version of themselves and often drifted away from the connections that had been so important to their lives.",
              "Covid has created a significant transition for us all.",
              "The importance of building and maintaining your connections has never been clearer.",
              "For most of us, the challenges and setbacks we are experiencing in work and life during this pandemic have been relentless.",
