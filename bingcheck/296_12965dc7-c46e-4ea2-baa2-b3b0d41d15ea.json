According to some research, music can:\n\n- Stimulate the release of brain chemicals such as **dopamine** and **oxytocin**, which are linked to feelings of **pleasure** and **love**[^1^] [^2^].\n- Lower our **heart rate** and **cortisol** levels, which are associated with **stress** and **anxiety**[^1^] [^4^].\n- Enhance our **cognitive function**, **learning ability**, and **memory** by activating diverse brain regions[^2^] [^3^].\n- Provide a source of **distraction**, **relaxation**, and **enjoyment** by fulfilling or violating our musical expectations[^2^] [^4^].\n\nTherefore, music can be harnessed to improve our mental well-being and reduce stress levels by choosing music that matches or induces our desired mood, listening to music that we find pleasurable and meaningful, and engaging in active musical activities such as singing, playing an instrument, or dancing[^1^] [^4^].",

              "The new findings have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
              "\u201cIn everyday life, humans regularly seek participation in highly complex and pleasurable experiences such as music listening, singing, or playing, that do not seem to have any specific survival advantage.",
              "Understanding how the brain translates a structured sequence of sounds, such as music, into a pleasant and rewarding experience is thus a challenging and fascinating question,\u201d said study author Laura Ferreri, an associate professor in cognitive psychology at Lyon University.",
              "\u201cIn the scientific literature, there was a lack of direct evidence showing that dopamine function is causally related to music-evoked pleasure.",
              "Therefore in this study, through a pharmacological approach, we wanted to investigate whether dopamine, which plays a major role in regulating pleasure experiences and motivation to engage in certain behaviors, plays a direct role in the experience of pleasure induced by music.",
              "\u201d The researchers manipulated the dopaminergic transmission of 27 participants while they were listening to music.",
              "In the three different sessions, separated by one week at least, the experts orally administrated to each participant a dopamine precursor (levodopa, which increases dopaminergic availability), a dopamine antagonist (risperidone;",

              "as a control).",
              "The researchers found that risperidone impaired participants\u2019 ability to experience musical pleasure, but levodopa enhanced it.",
              "\u201cThis study shows for the first time a causal role of dopamine in musical pleasure and motivation: enjoying a piece of music, deriving pleasure from it, wanting to listen to it again, being willing to spend money for it, strongly depend on the dopamine released in our synapses,\u201d Ferreri told PsyPost.",
              "\u201cWhat we found sheds new light on the role of the human dopaminergic system in abstract rewards.",
              "Indeed, our findings challenge previous evidence conducted in animal models, where dopaminergic manipulations showed a clear role of dopamine in motivation and learning, but a controversial function in regulating hedonic responses in primary rewards such as food, mainly related to opioids release.",
              "\u201d \u201cThese results indicate that dopaminergic transmission in humans might play different or additive roles than the ones postulated in affective processing so far, particularly in abstract cognitive activities such as music listening,\u201d Ferreri explained.",
              "The researchers found that participants were willing to spend more money under the dopamine precursor levodopa than under the dopamine antagonist risperidone, indicating that they were more motivated to listen to the music again when dopaminergic transmission was enhanced than when it was blocked.",
              "\u201cIt is important to highlight that we were not looking for a magic pill able to increase the feelings of pleasure while listening to music.",
              "We were interested in finding the neurochemical mechanisms underpinning the music-evoked pleasure, and we used a pharmacological approach to address this question,\u201d Ferreri added.",
              "\u201cWe cannot conclude that taking dopamine will increase your musical pleasure.",

              "Future studies are needed to test for the assumption that music listening might only reduce stress related psychological processes and anxiety in the context of mild stressors.",
              "Taken together, our results seem to indicate that pre-stress music listening might not be effective in reducing the biopsychological stress response, but might, in contrast, add to or facilitate a stress response.",
              "However, our results may also be interpreted in the light of another explanation: it may be that the participants in the music group were actually so relaxed that the subsequent stress induction was incompatible with this state of relaxation, and that they produced an increased stress response as a consequence.",
              "We might have therefore measured the effect of the contrast between a relaxing and a stressful state rather than the preparatory effects of relaxing music on the subsequent stress response.",
              "This notion is supported by the greatest increase in stress perception in the relaxing music group.",
              "Future studies should follow-up on this explanation and further dissect the effects of preparatory music listening on stress responses.",
              "Although this is the first study in which the effect of pre-stress music listening on a multitude of stress response domains was examined in the context of a rigorously controlled laboratory setting, our findings need to be considered in the light of the following limitations.",
              "Standardized music stimuli, selected by the researchers, might have different effects than those chosen by the participants themselves.",
              "In our study, however, we used a music stimulus which had already been evaluated as relaxing in previous research [6], so we were confident that this stimulus had stress-attenuating capacity independent of individual preferences.",
              "Also, using researcher-selected music stimuli has been shown to have greater effects on stress reduction than music stimuli selected by the subjects themselves [54].",
              "The focus on healthy young female participants, which were non-smoking, not taking any oral contraceptives, and being in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, restricts the generalization of the results beyond this particular sample.",
              "While the exclusion of potential confounding variables certainly improves internal validity, further research should investigate men also, as well as a mixed sample of men and women with more liberal inclusion criteria in order to reach more general conclusions.",
              "In summary, the findings of the present study demonstrate that listening to relaxing music prior to a stress task differentially affects biological stress response domains.",
              "Listening to relaxing music prior to a stressor did not decrease the endocrine stress response, but tended to increase it.",
              "Moreover, music listening helped the ANS to recover from a stressor more efficiently.",
              "Cognitive and emotional processes did not seem to be differently influenced by listening to relaxing music compared to listening to the sound of rippling water or resting with no acoustic stimulation prior to a stressor.",
              "As a consequence, our findings do not fully support the notion of using music listening as a successful stress management tool, at least not in the context of anticipating an upcoming stressor.",
              "Certainly, the potential health implications of the observed increase in HPA axis activation and the faster recovery of the ANS through listening to relaxing music are worth mentioning and should be further studied in order to better understand the potentially positive effects of music on the human body.",

The HRV response may be further complicated by existing cardiovascular disease and medication use, both of which must be considered in the study design [49].",
              "To understand mechanisms by which music may impact cardiovascular health, it will also be important to consider studying other important biomarkers, such as inflammatory and cardiac injury markers, natriuretic peptides, and vascular endothelial function, an excellent surrogate of coronary endothelial function [50] and valuable predictor of future cardiovascular health [51].",

              "Participants were often engaged in other concurrent activities, and one explanation for why liking of the least complex MEs remained high might be that this constituted an appropriate level of cognitive processing under those conditions (Konecni and Sargent-Pollock, 1976).",
              "The situation in which they actually made their ratings was considerably less natural, however.",
              "We cannot know if the ratings were affected by their listening in a more focused way during the rating task, but it is hard to find a methodological solution that avoids this.",
              "In conclusion, we feel that the ecological validity of the present study was higher than in previous studies, and more representative for typical music listening.",
              "Nevertheless, the hypothesis that liking of more complex music benefits from more listening remains valid, and should manifest itself in a greater increase for more complex than for less complex music.",
              "This also failed to materialize.",
              "If anything, effects were greater for the less complex music, in terms of decreases in both Odd and Dull, while the increase in liking was just as large for all levels of complexity.",
              "One could argue that the absolute level of complexity was too low or the range of complexity was too small to confer such a dissociation.",
              "Neither of these explanations is consistent with the pattern of results, however.",
              "First, the main rating proxy for complexity\u2014Dull\u2014showed moderate but significant differences in the expected direction between each level of complexity.",
              "Second, too little complexity would have led to decreased liking, but this was not the case even for the more familiar MEs, as shown in Figure \u200bFigure66.",
              "If we accept the present results, it should be noted that the most complex music was liked the most across all levels of presentations.",
              "If anything, a trend for the next most complex music to be liked next most suggests a U function rather than an inverted U.",

              "This study aimed to achieve the highest ecological validity possible for an experimental design, and differed from previous studies by using a naturalistic setting regarding what type of music people would actually listen to, and how they would actually listen to it.",

              "The results further challenge previous findings of a Wundt curve relationship for liking as a function of repeated listening, because those studies invariably involve less ecological validity and one or more features likely to render very low liking ratings.",

              "Published online by Cambridge University Press: 01 October 2008 When examining how emotions are evoked through music, the role of musical expectancy is often surprisingly under-credited.",
              "This mechanism, however, is most strongly tied to the actual structure of the music, and thus is important when considering how music elicits emotions.",
              "We briefly summarize Leonard Meyer's theoretical framework on musical expectancy and emotion and cite relevant research in the area.",
              "Our starting point is the very last entry in the target article's Table 4, which indicates that musical expectancy is the only mechanism that depends strongly on musical structure.",
              "Fortunately, the field of music theory provides conceptual tools for analyzing music, and this raises the question of what musical structures give rise to expectations and what are the emotional consequences.",
              "Our approach is to begin on the musical side and consider how understanding musical processes leads to a somewhat different perspective on musical emotions than that associated with Juslin & Va\u0308stfja\u0308ll's (J&V's) other five mechanisms. We identify Leonard Meyer's (1956) monograph, Emotion and Meaning in Music, as the most influential theoretical framework for studying musical emotions.",
              "Its success stems from his shift from the question \u201cWhy does music produce emotions?",
              "\u201d to the more tractable question, \u201cHow does music produce emotions?",
              "\u201d This focuses attention on the music itself and how it is constructed.",
              "Another important aspect of Meyer's theory is that it deemphasizes the general mood (such as happy, sad, or peaceful) engendered by passages, movements, or entire musical pieces, and emphasizes instead the moment-to-moment response to the ongoing flow of music.",
              "The theory's essential claim is that music produces emotions because listeners actively generate expectations (mostly unconsciously) for what is to follow.",
              "Depending on the relationship between these expectations and what actually happens, listeners experience varying degrees of tension or relaxation.",
              "In Meyer's words, \u201cThus in a very general way expectation is always ahead of the music, creating a background of diffuse tension against which particular delays articulate the affective curve and create meaning\u201d (Meyer Reference Meyer1956, p.",

              "(1) A 2022 review and meta-analysis of music therapy found an overall beneficial effect on stress-related outcomes.",
              "Moreover, music can be used to help in addressing serious mental health and substance use disorders.",

              "Research supports the idea that discrimination, a type of trauma, increases risk for mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.",

              "Research has shown that exposure to diverse musical genres and artists can broaden perspectives, challenge stereotypes, and foster empathy among listeners especially when dancing together.",
              "(7) Genres such as hip-hop, reggae, jazz, blues, rhythm & blues and folk have historically served as platforms for marginalized voices, enabling them to reclaim their narratives and challenge societal norms.

              "For example, although people might report their brain health as \u201cexcellent,\u201d there was no objective measure of brain health such as an MRI scan, or even a test to measure their cognition.",
              "Lastly, even if the ratings were true, the findings are only correlations.",

              "It may be equally likely that those children brought up in more affluent households were both more likely to be exposed to music and to be given a good education that led to their being able to easily learn new things later in life.",
              "But let\u2019s assume that the results of the AARP survey are indeed true.",
              "How can music have such impressive brain effects?",
              "Although we don\u2019t know the answers for sure, developments in cognitive neuroscience over the last few years have allowed us to speculate on some possible mechanisms. Music has been shown to activate some of the broadest and most diverse networks of the brain.",

              "Although we don\u2019t know the answers for sure, developments in cognitive neuroscience over the last few years have allowed us to speculate on some possible mechanisms. Music has been shown to activate some of the broadest and most diverse networks of the brain.",

              "So just how does music promote well-being, enhance learning, stimulate cognitive function, improve quality of life, and even induce happiness?",
              "The answer is, because music can activate almost all brain regions and networks, it can help to keep a myriad of brain pathways and networks strong, including those networks that are involved in well-being, learning, cognitive function, quality of life, and happiness.",
