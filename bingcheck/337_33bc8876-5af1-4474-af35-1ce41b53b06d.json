    "response": "That's a great question. Reducing plastic waste in the fashion industry is a crucial challenge for both environmental and economic reasons. According to the search results, some of the most innovative and promising approaches are:\n\n- Making clothes more sustainably with organic and recycled materials, such as **H&M Conscious, Adidas x Parley and Zara Join Life**[^1^].\n- Using circular polybags that can be recycled into new polybags, such as those developed by **Cadel Deinking** and tested by **Adidas, Kering and PVH**[^2^].\n- Buying second-hand clothes from charity shops, jumble sales or online platforms, which can extend the life of clothes and reduce the demand for new production[^1^].\n- Renting clothes instead of buying them, which can offer access to new pieces without generating waste[^1^].\n- Buying less clothes and choosing quality over quantity, which can reduce the environmental footprint of fashion consumption[^3^].\n\nAs consumers, we can support these initiatives and promote a more sustainable approach to fashion by:\n\n- Choosing brands that use sustainable materials and packaging, and avoiding those that use single-use plastic or synthetic fabrics[^2^] [^4^].\n- Donating or reselling our unwanted clothes instead of throwing them away, and buying pre-owned clothes when possible[^1^] [^5^].\n- Renting clothes for special occasions or swapping clothes with friends or family, which can offer variety without waste[^1^].\n- Buying less clothes and wearing them for longer, and repairing or upcycling them when they get damaged[^3^] [^5^].\n\nI hope this helps you learn more about this important topic.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "This is a consequence of the industry\u2019s traditional linear model, in which clothing is produced, used, and then discarded.",
              "And consumers today are buying more, driving brands to ramp up production, thus compounding the problem.",
              "While efforts to transition to circular and sustainable business models have long been underway, progress has been slow.",
              "Today, circular solutions are far outpaced by the sheer scale of consumption and production.",
              "The urgency of the climate crisis and the enormity of the waste problem call for a greater focus on solutions to reduce fashion\u2019s footprint in the near term.",
              "Promoting the reuse of garments is imperative;",
              "however, all garments eventually reach an end-of-life moment, when they can no longer be reused.",
              "Achieving true circularity in the fashion industry requires advanced recycling solutions to prepare for the end of life of the vast inventory of clothing in circulation that was manufactured using traditional, linear methods and for textiles that are difficult or impossible to recycle using available technologies.",
              "Rather than focusing solely on waste reduction, the fashion industry should adopt a pragmatic approach to circularity and double down on end-of-life recycling solutions, ensuring that textile waste stimulates the production of new garments rather than growth in landfills.",
              "The fashion industry\u2019s overreliance on natural resources for production, coupled with unsustainable waste management and excess production, has had a devastating impact on the environment.",
              "(See Exhibit 1.)",
              "Repercussions of the industry\u2019s practices include deforestation, loss of biodiversity, water scarcity, soil degradation, chemical pollution, and a massive carbon footprint.",
              "Fashion\u2019s traditional linear \u201ctake-make-waste\u201d model contributes to the growing climate crisis by releasing greenhouse gases and using virgin inputs for new production.",
              "Circularity offers a promising solution by establishing a closed-loop system that enables textiles to re-enter the value chain, thereby prolonging the value capture of materials.",
              "The circular value chain holistically addresses waste through five interconnected levers.",
              "(See Exhibit 2.)",
              "Each step, from material choice to circular design, is a critical enabler for the end-of-life stage, which allows products to be recycled and reused over and over again.",
              "For example, technical fibers are often derived from nonrenewable resources and take a long time to decompose in landfills.",
              "Increasing the recycled content in technical fibers reduces the demand for virgin resources, conserves energy, and minimizes waste.",
              "Given the interdependencies across the value chain, achieving a fully circular value chain will require the maturation of each step, which takes considerable time.",
              "As we continue to make progress in advancing long-term levers like materials innovation and circular design, there is a heightened need to focus on end-of-life circularity solutions to mitigate fashion\u2019s waste crisis in the near term.",
              "We must prioritize the development and scaling of advanced recycling systems that can convert multiple sources of textile waste (for example, post-consumer, manufacturing scraps, damaged goods, and excess inventory) into reusable materials, thereby increasing the availability of virgin-equivalent circular inputs for manufacturing.",
              "Before a garment can be recycled, it must go through a series of steps executed by several players working together.",
              "Textile waste is collected from consumer and industrial sources;",
              "sorted by category, condition, and material composition;",
              "and then designated for either reuse or recycling.",
              "(See Exhibit 3.)",
              "The process is far from being perfectly linear and straightforward.",
              "Instead, it is a complex and intricate web of diverse connections and actors characterized by several complications.",
              "Recognizing these complications is the first step toward designing appropriate interventions.",
              "In addition to the complexities that drive inefficiencies in the end-of-life process, there are several gaps where circularity efforts fail and merely postpone landfilling of textile waste.",
              "These gaps, discussed below, must be bridged to promote a perpetual cycle of true circularity.",
              "Collection.",
              "Significant volumes of reusable and recyclable garments are either not being collected or are being discarded due to barriers that limit consumer engagement and brand adoption of reuse and recycling.",
              "Sorting.",
              "Inefficiencies in the sorting market, driven by nascent technologies and inadequate connectivity, inhibit the optimal processing of garments.",
              "Reuse.",
              "Reuse models (resale, repair, or rental) without accompanying measures for products whose lifecycle cannot be further extended are incomplete solutions for achieving circularity.",
              "Recycling.",
              "Open-loop and closed-loop recycling have significant limitations: Closed-loop recycling technologies have not achieved scale.",
              "Closed-loop recycling, which converts textile waste into fiber that can be used in new material production, has yet to achieve the scale required to process the full spectrum of materials produced and volumes of waste generated.",
              "There are two main methods of closed-loop recycling: While several solutions to advance circularity from an end-of-life perspective exist, their adoption by the fashion industry remains limited.",
              "Rather than waiting for the next breakthrough technology or becoming paralyzed in the pursuit of perfection, the industry must seize opportunities to take meaningful action now.",
              "To accelerate progress toward a circular future with positive financial returns, the fashion industry must pursue the strategies discussed below.",
              "The limited inclusion of recycled textiles in clothing lines today is driven by the low availability and high price of recycled fibers compared with alternatives.",
              "Brands rely on recycled plastic waste for their sustainable collections while waiting for recycled textiles to become economically viable.",
              "This is particularly true for recycled polyester, as most brands use recycled plastics (for example, plastic bottles and packaging) from other industries instead of using regenerated polyester from the garments they produce.",
              "This has resulted in a recycling paradox, where textile-recycling technologies are unable to scale without sufficient demand for their output from brands, and brands are hesitant to increase their use of recycled textiles until these technologies become more cost-effective.",
              "To break this cycle, brands must increase their use of recycled textiles available today while also investing in the growth of closed-loop textile-recycling technologies to drive demand and achieve economies of scale.",
              "While investment is needed to support early-stage innovations and to scale promising technologies, the latter is harder to achieve given high-risk, capital-intense requirements to scale.",
              "There are many promising technologies, particularly in closed-loop recycling, that are ready to be scaled today.",
              "However, most players find it challenging to scale their operations beyond a single commercial-scale plant.",
              "Alternative investment models, such as licensing and joint ventures, can reduce upfront capital needs and allow innovators to overcome current funding constraints to scale.",
              "Although the tradeoffs between pursuing these alternative investment models and establishing owned-and-operated factories are not unique to textile recycling, prioritizing the former can deliver speed to scale with favorable economic returns.",
              "Scaling recycling without developing the supporting infrastructure and technology for collection and sorting will create a feedstock gap.",
              "Closed-loop recyclers have high purity standards and can primarily process mono-materials (for example, pure cotton).",
              "Purity constraints, combined with the difficulty in accurately identifying the composition of post-consumer waste, make it a less desirable source of feedstock despite being considerably larger than industrial waste.",
              "As demand for recycled output increases, competition for pure feedstock will also increase, impacting its supply.",
              "To address this issue, it is essential to scale closed-loop recycling technologies that can process a wider variety of blended materials and sorting technologies that can accurately identify material composition, making post-consumer waste a more viable source of feedstock.",
              "Individual, small-scale efforts will not achieve the impact required to tackle fashion\u2019s decentralized waste problem.",
              "Industry actors have launched initiatives and joined coalitions and alliances to create collective action.",
              "Despite the commitment, many players chase communal goals individually, resulting in a sustainability landscape saturated with well-intentioned but fragmented and overlapping initiatives.",
              "Actors must give a higher priority to consolidating efforts at scale than to pursuing individual competitive advantages.",
              "For instance, brands can consolidate take-back programs, pool investment in technologies, and share best practices to amplify and accelerate impact.",
              "Chemical closed-loop recyclers can also work together to ensure that impurities extracted during processing (that is, materials a particular technology cannot recycle) are passed on to recyclers with suitable technology.",
              "For example, a polyester closed-loop recycler can pass on the cotton extracted during processing to a cotton closed-loop recycler.",
              "In searching for opportunities with the highest potential for impact and visibility, brands often overlook short-term prospects that can move the needle.",
              "But brands can gradually build end-of-life business models by starting with initiatives that fit into their current ecosystem.",
              "One such opportunity could be forging partnerships that unify incentives, remove friction, and create revenue streams. For example, brands can sell their excess inventory directly to closed-loop recyclers, thereby making it easier for recyclers to source feedstock with known material composition.",
              "Brands can further integrate circularity into their core business operations through versatile tools that drive business and social value.",
              "For instance, digital IDs enable brands to remain connected to their consumers beyond the point of sale and generate future revenue streams by offering authentication and traceability.",
              "Additionally, digital IDs can be used to engage consumers via marketing and storytelling;",
              "educate them about the product\u2019s origin, materials, and care;",

              "If manmade cellulosic is required, brands should work with sourcing partners who are known to avoid sourcing their inputs from ancient and endangered forests.",
              "The Textile Exchange has developed guidance to help brands through this process: Note that in the world of reusable packaging, brands aren\u2019t as limited by functionality and aesthetics.",
              "In some cases, an organic cotton bag would work as well as a polyester bag.",
              "That said, we encourage brands to factor in aesthetics (is a certain color preferred, does a certain type of thinness and shapability work better, etc), and functionality (does it need to be dustproof and waterproof) as they are making decisions.",
              "Functionality is essential for reusable mailers, which will encounter a lot of dirt and dust as it is shipped back and forth.",
              "In these situations, it is rare for an entirely natural fiber - moisture and dirt-absorbing - to work.",
              "Ultimately, we believe one of the most important ecological questions to ask of fabric, or more specifically the finished good made with fabrics, are: How durable is it?",
              "Suppose something has a poor eco impact but can, and will, be used for decades.",
              "In that case, it is much better environmentally than a comparable product with a better ecological impact only used for a single season.",
              "Does it successfully do its job?",

              ", does it do so successfully?",
              "These questions often get lost in the deep analysis of LCAs and Higg Scores.",
              "The best thing the fashion industry - and all industries, including the packaging industry - can do is encourage consumers to buy less and use things for much, much longer.",
              "In reusable packaging, durability, usability, and lifespan are critical.",
              "A reusable retail tote can be a great eco alternative to a single-use plastic or paper bag.",
              "However, if that tote is made poorly and rips quickly, and therefore is only used two or three times before getting landfilled, it would have a very significant net negative impact on the planet.",
              "If a linen liner bag replaces an inner poly bag, the first question a brand should ask is: will most of my customers really use this reusable inner bag, and how can I help make it as functional long-term as possible?",
              "Solving for usability and durability thoughtfully will ensure that reusable packaging is used enough times such that it is a net positive for the planet and leads to lower levels of materials consumption long-term.",

              "Although the government and businesses provide a good environment for the recycling of SHC, consumers, as the producers of SHC, play an irreplaceable role in improving the recycling rate of used clothing, as their disposal decisions determine the flow of used clothing8.",

              "Zhang and Dong13 investigated the impact of virtual social capital on sustainable SHC consumption patterns and highlighted the importance of social factors in shaping Chinese consumers' sustainable SHC consumption patterns in the context of the social media development.",
              "Based on the extant literature, it is evident that there remains a dearth of research investigating the determinants of residents' behaviour pertaining to second-hand clothing donation in China, an emerging economy.",
              "It is noteworthy that the study of pro-environmental behaviour frequently employs psychologically grounded theories, such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)14.",
              "From an individual rationality standpoint, these theories place significant emphasis on the impact of attitude, norms, and other related factors on behavioral intention, and dem onstrating its effectiveness by numerous studies14, 15.",
              "However, these theories tend to overlook the role of social factors and irrational personal emotional factors in shaping behaviour.",
              "Consequently, the present study incorporates the Interpersonal Behavior Theory (TIB) as a supplementary framework.",
              "Furthermore, an oversight in the existing body of research utilising the TIB framework to investigate the domain of sustainability is the limited consideration given to the influence of environmental factors16.",
              "Hence, this study incorporates environmental psychological factors (problem awareness, ascription of responsibility) into the research framework in order to enhance the comprehensiveness of predicting the factors that impact consumer donation to SHC.",
              "To alleviate the impact of textile waste on the environment and partially fill the gap in existing research, this study aimed to explore the factors influencing SHC donation intention and the actual donation of SHC.",
              "To achieve this objective, this study proposed a model based on a combination of the TIB model and environmental psychology factors, including cognitive factors (attitude toward sustainable consumption, environmental factors (problem awareness and ascription of responsibility), social factors (sense of community), and personal factors (perceived hedonic benefit).",
              "This construct model was empirically tested in China.",

              "In the TIB model, Triandis17 pointed out that an individual\u2019s behavioral intention is mainly influenced by cognitive, social, and personal factors.",
              "Among these, attitude is an influencing factor of behavioral intention, which has attracted much attention in previous studies18.",
              "As mentioned by Ajzen19, attitudes show people\u2019s views or perceptions of certain things and promote the generation of individual behaviors.",
              "Simultaneously, social factors are also emphasized in the TIB model.",
              "As social individuals, it is difficult for humans to escape the influence of society;",
              "therefore, social factors are key in the study of pro-environmental behavior.",
              "In addition, when previous popular models studied individual behavioral intentions and related behaviors from a psychological perspective, most were based on decisions made by individuals under rational thinking, and few discussed the impact of individual emotions on behavioral intentions under irrational behavior18.",
              "Previous studies have confirmed that TIB has a strong ability to explain intentions and behaviors16, 20.",
              "Therefore, it is appropriate to apply TIB to the pro-environmental context of SHC donation, which considers rational attitudes, irrational emotions, and social impact.",
              "Based on the above theoretical background, although the TIB model has been applied to pro-environmental behaviors in some studies, it has not received much attention in combination with environmental psychological factors.",
              "Thus, this study included environmental factors based on the TIB model, making the research framework more adaptable to the pro-environmental context that refers to the sustainable disposal of SHC.",
              "Attitude refers to the degree to which a person evaluates a behavior positively or negatively19.",
              "It is the key component of various research models such as TPB and TIB17, 19.",
              "Positive attitude produces positive results, and vice versa.",

              "21 verified that the status of consumers environment attitudes positively affects their environment behavioral intention.",
              "Research on second-hand product buying also confirms that attitudes toward sustainable consumption can increase consumers\u2019 intentions to buy SHC22 or donate SHC6.",
              "Therefore, this study proposed the following hypothesis: H1: ASC positively influences SDI.",
              "PRA is the perception about the severity of the problems that individuals may meet during their life23.",
              "It is further defined as an individual\u2019s awareness of predictable environmental problems. When people are aware of problems in the environment, they may consciously avoid these problems or participate more actively in solving them.",
              "In many existing studies on pro-environment files, PRA is considered the decisive factor in pro-environment behavioral intention or behavior24, 25.",
              "The rise of pro-environmental and pro-social movements has led to increased awareness of the detrimental effects of resource waste through social media platforms. Consequently, individuals are motivated to take action in order to mitigate the adverse consequences on the environment23.",
              "A similar perspective is also shared by Song et al.",
              "25, who argue that customers exhibit a greater intention towards reusing express packages when they become aware of the environmental issues stemming from inadequate handling practices.",
              "Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed: H2: PRA positively influences SDI.",
              "The concept of ASR has been a critical topic in various studies related to prosocial behavior for a few years25, 26.",
              "ASR for this study is described as a sense of responsibility toward the negative impact of failing to engage in pro-environmental behaviors26.",
              "People determine what they should or should not do based on how much responsibility they are assigned.",
              "Consequently, ASR will help people become more inclined to adopt pro-environmental behaviors and, to some extent, deter them from engaging in environmentally destructive behavior.",
              "When Onwezen et al.",
              "27 studied pro-environmental behaviors, they emphasized the positive effect of responsibility-related factors on pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "Vaske et al.",
              "28 also proposed that farmers with a strong ASR have a greater intention to engage in conventional behaviors.",
              "Following the empirical studies, it is expected that once individuals ascribe to the responsibility to act to reduce environmental threats, they have more intention to donate SHC.",
              "Thus, this study proposed the following hypothesis: H3: ASR positively influences SDI.",
              "SOC is an individual\u2019s feeling of belongingness, which refers to the importance of both individuals and groups to each other, and that sharing of faith among individuals and collectives can be achieved through mutual effort29.",
              "Some researchers have defined SOC as the emotional bond that people have with society30,31,32.",
              "Overall, society is the ultimate beneficiary of pro-environmental behavior;",
              "therefore, it is essential to link the intention of sustainable development behavior with a SOC.",
              "Individuals who possess a robust emotional attachment to society are more inclined to exhibit psychological awareness and actively participate in environmentally sustainable behaviors33, 34.",
              "When examining the factors that influence people's participation in pro environment behaviors, researchers such as Schanes and Stagl35 discovered that identity and SOC were motivational factors in individuals\u2019 intention to share food.",
              "Therefore, this study proposed the following hypothesis: H4: SOC positively influences SDI.",
              "PHB refers to the happiness of an individual stemming from their behavior;",
              "it is a positive emotional outcome for customers36.",
              "PHB is an important motivation factor in an individual\u2019s behavioral intention as it is the intrinsic emotional benefits37.",
              "Numerous empirical investigations have substantiated the notion that individuals are more likely to exhibit pro-environmental behaviours when they derive additional gratification from engaging in such activities38,39,40.",
              "After investigating the sustainable clothing disposal behavior of Indonesian consumers, Fenitra et al.",
              "40 also confirmed that emotional factors positively impact donation behavior.",
              "Therefore, a high PHB toward activities always indicates a high intention to conduct them.",
              "Hence, we proposed the following hypothesis: H5: PHB positively influences SDI.",
              "Intention is a stimulus or perceived subjective that originates from an individual and is typically regarded as the cause of behavior21, 41.",
              "Numerous theories cite intention as a factor that directly influences actual behavior, include the TIB, TPB, and technology acceptance model17, 19, 42.",

              "Previous studies on pro-environmental backgrounds have also confirmed the strong or at least moderate relationship between intention and behavior21, 43,44,45.",
              "According to a study conducted by Liu et al.",
              "21 about pro-environment behaviour, it was observed that Chinese residents exhibit a higher likelihood of translating their pro-environmental intention into actual actions.",
              "Therefore, this study proposed the following hypothesis: H6: SDI positively influences SDB.",
              "Based on the TIB model and environmental psychological factors, this study proposed ASC, PRA, ASR, SOC, and PHB as important predictors of SDI based on the previous studies 25, 28, 35, 40.",
              "In addition, a relationship between SDI and SDB has also been founded by many researchers21, 44.",

              "Best of What's New: The 50 greatest innovations of 2023 \u00bb Reduce, reuse, then maybe rent.",
              "By Carla Delgado | Published Mar 3, 2022 6:00 AM EST People have been renting formal wear for more than sixty years, whether it\u2019s for proms, weddings, or other special occasions.",
              "Consumers often opted for rentals because it didn\u2019t make financial sense to buy an article of clothing that will only be worn once.",
              "Today, fashion rental services have begun expanding to casual wear, and many fashion-conscious consumers are keen to try them out to reduce clothing waste.",
              "With 11.",
              "3 million tons of textile waste landfilled in 2018\u2014most of which is discarded clothing\u2014minimizing waste is crucial.",
              "However, is renting clothes really more sustainable than buying a new article of clothing?",
              "Research shows it\u2019s not that simple.",
              "According to a small 2021 study published in Sustainability, Gen Z adult consumers were keen on trying apparel rental services to reduce their overconsumption of clothes.",
              "Renting, theoretically, would satisfy the desire for a new wardrobe, but the focus would be on usage, not ownership.",
              "The researchers gathered 362 eligible responses via an online survey and found that there are plenty of factors significantly affecting consumers\u2019 willingness to use apparel rental services, says Ting Chi, one of the study authors and chair of the Department of Apparel, Merchandising, Design, and Textiles at the Washington State University.",
              "For instance, Gen Z consumers are more likely to rent clothes if they know someone who has a positive perception of it.",
              "Education on environmental benefits of clothing rentals and past environmental behavior was also linked to the intent to use apparel rental services.",
              "\u201cOwnership burdens may lead to discarding the item, donating the item, or selling the item secondhand and prematurely,\u201d says Chi.",
              "\u201cRenting apparel could be a viable solution to consumers who prefer the latest trends without the ownership burden.",
              "\u201d On the surface level, renting services can help extend the life of clothes, provide easier access to items that might have been otherwise unavailable, and encourage people to buy less often.",
              "However, renting is not necessarily synonymous with sustainability.",
              "A 2021 study published in Environmental Research Letters suggests that buying a new pair of jeans, using it as you normally would, and disposing of it would be better for the environment than renting a pair and returning it after 10 uses.",
              "The researchers compared the estimated total carbon dioxide emissions throughout the production, delivery, utilization, and end-of-life stages of both scenarios and found that renting a pair of jeans would have a higher global warming potential.",
              "Although renting would increase the utility of the product, getting and returning the item of clothing is said to generate more emissions.",
              "However, if the consumer were to increase the number of times the jeans are worn and use a low-carbon mode of transportation, it would be equal to or more sustainable than buying a new pair, according to the study.",
              "\u201cFactors that would impact which has greater or less harm [between renting or buying clothes] would include how many times the garment would be worn if it were purchased, the distance traveled between each rental cycle, and the washing methods used in each,\u201d says Maxine Be\u0301dat, founder and director of The New Standard Institute who was not involved in the study.",
              "The type of clothing being rented or bought plays a big factor in sustainability as well.",
              "For instance, buying a new, poor-quality fast fashion item would not be the same as purchasing a high-quality piece of clothing that\u2019s made to last, says Sonali Diddi, associate professor in the Department of Design and Merchandising and core faculty in the School of Global Environmental Sustainability at the Colorado State University who was not involved in the study.",
              "The impact of renting from a store within walking distance compared to a delivery from an online rental service will also be different.",
              "\u201cOnline fashion rental business models, while very innovative, need to be more transparent about their business practices across the entire supply chain to be able to promote the sustainability aspect of their business model,\u201d says Diddi.",
              "\u201cIn short, given the lack of data and information available about online fashion rental business, it does not seem to be a sustainable choice over buying new clothes.",
              "\u201d Subscription fashion rental service Rent the Runway (RTR), commissioned a study in 2021 to perform a life cycle assessment of the rental business model compared to purchasing a new garment.",
              "The study, conducted with third-party sustainability consultancies JPB Strategies, Green Story, and SgT, concluded that renting saved water, energy, and carbon emissions compared to buying new clothes.",
              "However, they didn\u2019t provide concrete verifiable information and data, which brings into question the reliability of their findings, says Diddi.",
              "\u201cWith sustainability and climate change discussions becoming more mainstream and on consumers\u2019 radar, fashion rental companies, and especially RTR, engaged in claims that renting clothes is a sustainable choice of fashion consumption without providing clear data,\u201d she adds.",
              "\u201cI think online fashion rental companies need to intentionally engage in sustainable practices [rather than] providing a \u2018band-aid\u2019 and reactive approach.",
              "\u201d Renting could be more sustainable if there were more in-store pick-up options, convenient drop-off locations, sustainable cleaning practices, and environmentally friendly packaging options, says Diddi.",
              "Providing an incentive to return plastic packaging, being transparent about the supply chain, and showing a clear end-of-life plan and accountability for rented clothes would also help bolster bold sustainability claims. \u201cThe best way to promote sustainable fashion consumption is for consumers to follow \u2018Avoid, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle\u2019 in that order,\u201d says Diddi.",
              "The most sustainable practice would be to avoid buying new clothes in the first place.",
              "You can try swapping wardrobe staples with friends and family members instead.",
              "Repairing and reusing clothes also extend a garment\u2019s lifespan.",
              "Should you decide to purchase something new, focus on the needs rather than the wants.",
              "Buy high-quality clothes that are built to last and avoid synthetic fibers, which are a significant contributor to microplastic pollution.",
              "\u201cFashion disruptive models like online rental, while innovative, cannot be termed as the most sustainable choice given the high environmental impacts related to cleaning, transportation, and packaging,\u201d says Diddi.",
              "\u201cFurther, mostly all the online fashion rental models give an option to consumers to buy the clothes that have been rented, further fueling the fashion overconsumption epidemic.",
              "\u201d Overall, we still need further research to have a more concrete answer on the sustainability of renting compared to buying new clothes, says Be\u0301dat.",
              "For now, you can opt to rent pieces that you won\u2019t be wearing often, which reduces the need to produce new clothing\u2014but it may be better to own the wardrobe essentials that you turn to frequently.",
