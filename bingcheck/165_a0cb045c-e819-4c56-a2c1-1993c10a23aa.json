    "query": "Can you explain the process and techniques used in forensics to determine the time of death for a deceased person? Are there any new technologies or advancements that have been made in recent years to improve the accuracy of these determinations?",
    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. I can try to explain the process and techniques used in forensics to determine the time of death for a deceased person. According to [^1^], the time of death is of crucial importance for forensic investigators, especially when they are gathering evidence that can support or deny the stated actions of suspects in a crime. The time elapsed from the moment of death until a corpse is discovered is also known as the postmortem interval, or PMI.\n\nThere are several methods that can be used to estimate the PMI, such as:\n\n- Algor mortis: This is the change in body temperature after death. The body usually cools down at a predictable rate until it reaches the ambient temperature. However, this method can be affected by various factors, such as clothing, body fat, environmental conditions, etc. A formula that can be used to calculate the time of death based on body temperature is:\n\nTime since death = (98.6 - Body temperature) / T\n\nWhere:\n\nTime since death is given in hours;\nBody temperature is given in Fahrenheit (F); and\nT is a factor that depends on the ambient temperature:\nWhen ambient temperature < 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C), T = 1.5; and\nWhen ambient temperature \u2265 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C), T = 0.75.\n\n- Rigor mortis: This is the stiffening of the muscles after death due to the depletion of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is needed for muscle contraction and relaxation. Rigor mortis usually begins 2 to 4 hours after death, reaches its maximum at 12 hours, and disappears after 36 hours. However, this method can also be influenced by various factors, such as physical activity, temperature, drugs, etc.\n\n- Livor mortis: This is the pooling of blood in the dependent parts of the body due to gravity and lack of circulation. Livor mortis usually begins 30 minutes to 4 hours after death and is most pronounced 12 hours after death. The color and distribution of livor mortis can provide clues about the cause and position of death.\n\nThere are also other methods that can be used to estimate the PMI, such as:\n\n- Stomach contents: This can indicate when the last meal was consumed and how long it took to digest.\n- Insect activity: This can indicate how long the body has been exposed to insects and what stage of decomposition it is in.\n- Chemical analysis: This can measure the levels of certain substances in the body fluids or tissues, such as potassium in the eye fluid or hypoxanthine in the muscle tissue.\n- Molecular analysis: This can measure the changes in gene expression or DNA degradation that occur after death.\n\nSome of these methods are more accurate and reliable than others, depending on the circumstances and conditions of each case. There are also new technologies and advancements that have been made in recent years to improve the accuracy of these determinations, such as:\n\n- Thermography: This is a technique that uses infrared cameras to measure the surface temperature of the body and create a thermal image that can reveal patterns of heat loss.\n- Electrical impedance: This is a technique that measures the resistance of the body tissues to an electric current and calculates the changes in water content and ion concentration that occur after death.\n- Biosensors: These are devices that detect and measure specific biological molecules or reactions that are associated with postmortem changes, such as glucose, lactate, pH, etc.\n\nThese technologies are still under development and research, but they have shown promising results in some studies and experiments.\n\nI hope this explanation was helpful and informative. \ud83d\ude0a",

              "In light of these findings, the authors advocate using multiple systems, both qualitative and quantitative, to ensure the reliability of the estimated TSD.",
              "Post-mortem interval (PMI) has traditionally been classified into immediate, early, and late stages.",
              "Immediate PMI In the immediate period, the body undergoes rapid biochemical and physiological changes that are primarily caused by the absence of circulation of blood and loss of regulatory mechanisms. These changes are principally detectable in the eyes and the skin.",
              "In the eyes, 'trucking' or segmentation of retinal blood vessels is one of the first observable signs.",
              "This sign presents as a break in the continual column of blood on ophthalmoscopic examination of the eyes and usually occurs within half an hour and may sometimes take as long as 2 hours after death.",
              "[1] The other changes in the eyes, in the immediate post-mortem phase, include loss of intraocular pressure and the clouding of the cornea.",
              "The intraocular pressure decreases drastically after death and reaches 4 mmHg or less within 6 hours after death.",
              "[2] The cornea begins to cloud within 2 hours after death and usually prevents intra-ocular examination with an ophthalmoscope.",
              "[3] The skin loses its elasticity and luster within the first few hours after death and appears pale.",
              "Histological examination of the skin, however, shows no morphological changes within 6 hours PMI.",
              "[4] Other examinations show a lack of cellular or biochemical changes within 3 to 6 hours post-mortem.",
              "[5] Emptying gastric contents is another method used for estimating the post-mortem interval.",
              "Small light meals get emptied from the stomach within 1 to 3 hours, and the time of consumption, if known \u2013 along with volume and type of meal, can be used to estimate the post-mortem interval.",
              "[6] Therefore, the immediate post-mortem phase can be termed as the post-mortem interval between somatic and cellular death, within 2 to 3 hours after death, and usually denotes a lack of discernible changes in the morphology or histo-chemistry.",
              "Early PMI The early post-mortem phase is probably the most important time period for PMI estimation, as most medico-legal cases are examined in this time period.",
              "This period is also where the estimation of time since death is most relevant in establishing the timeline of events and developing a theory of circumstances of death.",
              "This period runs from 3 to 72 hours after death.",
              "The early post-mortem phase is most frequently estimated using the classical triad of post-mortem changes \u2013 rigor mortis, livor mortis, and algor mortis.",
              "Algor Mortis Algor mortis is the cooling of the body after death, primarily due to the loss of homeostatic regulation by the hypothalamus, in conjunction with the loss of heat to the environment by conduction, convection, and radiation.",

              "However, it involves a cumbersome procedure and requires intensive knowledge and research before it is accurately usable in the field;",

              "in 1984.",
              "[9] Rigor Mortis Rigor mortis is the post-mortem stiffening of muscles caused by the depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the muscles, which is necessary for the breakdown of actin-myosin filaments in the muscle fibers.",
              "Actin and myosin are components of the muscle fiber and form a bond during contraction.",
              "The cessation of oxygen supply causes the stoppage of aerobic respiration in the cells and leads to a lack of ATP production.",
              "Rigor mortis starts immediately after death and is usually seen in a sequence known as the \"march of rigor\" and Nysten's Law.",
              "While rigor mortis develops simultaneously in all muscle tissue in the body, voluntary and involuntary, the size of the muscle determines the perceptibility of changes by the examiner.",
              "Smaller muscles over the face \u2013 around the eyes, around the mouth, etc.",
              "are the muscles where rigor mortis first appears, followed by rigor mortis of the muscles in the hands and upper limbs, and finally appears in the large muscles of the lower limbs.",
              "Rigor mortis appears approximately 2 hours after death in the muscles of the face, progresses to the limbs over the next few hours, completing between 6 to 8 hours after death.",
              "[10] Rigor mortis then stays for another 12 hours (till 24 hours after death) and then disappears.",
              "[11] In the last phase of rigor mortis, the actin-myosin complex that has formed starts disintegrating due to proteolysis, resulting in the dissolution of the stiffness.",
              "This process begins in all the cells at the same time.",
              "However, just like with the appearance, this change is perceptible first in the smaller muscles of the face, followed by muscles of the upper limbs, and finally, the large muscles in the lower limbs.",
              "Rigor mortis generally disappears 36 hours after death, followed by a phase known as secondary flaccidity.",
              "Livor Mortis The final change in the classical triad is livor mortis, which is the purplish-blue discoloration of the skin in the dependent parts of the body due to the collection of blood in skin vessels caused by gravitational pull.",
              "Hypostasis develops as spots of discoloration within half an hour to 2 hours.",
              "These spots then coalesce into larger patches, which combine to form a uniform discoloration of the body's dependant parts that have not been subject to pressure, which appears from 6 to 12 hours.",
              "The discoloration becomes 'fixed' after a certain period, owing to blood cells' disintegration and hemoglobin's seepage.",
              "This fixation is confirmed by applying pressure with thumbs and is traditionally used to denote a PMI greater than 12 hours.",
              "[12] This method of estimation of PMI required an objective and modern approach, leading to the development of colorimetric methods to estimate PMI from livor mortis.",
              "[13] Histo-morphological Analysis Other methods of estimating TSD in the early phase include histo-morphological and Bio-chemical analysis.",
              "Total and differential blood counts and the microscopic morphological examination of blood have been described as a method for estimation of the TSD.",
              "All blood cells were not identifiable beyond 84 hours after death.",
              "Similarly, blood cell counts were also found to decrease beyond 84 hours after death.",
              "[5] Histological studies of the skin have shown that degenerative changes appear in the skin 6 hours after death and first appear as vacuolating the corpus basale and spinosum.",
              "Dermo-epidermal separation is seen 9 hours after death, while the dermis showed rarefaction and disintegration 6 and 18 hours after death, respectively.",
              "The glycogen in the basal membrane of the sweat glands, the secretory cells cytoplasm, and duct cells gets depleted within 3 hours PMI and leads to PAS-negative cells on histology.",
              "The basal membrane, however, continues to show a magenta staining up to 18 hours post-mortem.",
              "The eccrine sweat glands show vacuolation after 3 to 4 hours of PMI, and cells appear to have completely disintegrated 15 hours after death.",
              "The sebaceous glands appear normal till 18 hours post-mortem, seen as separating the layers and disintegrating hair papilla.",
              "[4] Studies have also shown that pleocytosis can estimate the PMI using a polynomial equation of the third order.",
              "The cells are primarily lymphocytes with a significant fraction of macrophages, which become vacuolated and unidentifiable after 12 hours.",
              "[14] Biochemical Assessment Biochemical blood assessment is non-significant in the immediate post-mortem phase due to the lack of cellular death.",
              "On the other hand, cellular death makes biochemical blood assessment in the early phase extremely difficult.",
              "Also, there is the redistribution of electrolytes from the cells into the plasma and serum, resulting in varying changes in the levels of these electrolytes.",
              "These variations and their implications are studied in the emerging field of thanato-chemistry.",
              "The biochemical assessment has been useful for estimating PMI from vitreous humor, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.",
              "Numerous factors, however, need to be accounted for when examining the PMI based on biochemistry, including, but not limited to, age, gender, biological background, lifestyle, cause of death, and a whole range of other intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",
              "Only a few biochemical markers (out of 388) were found to have had sufficient investigation with these considerations \u2013 namely potassium, sodium, urea, as well as chloride, magnesium, hypoxanthine, and cardiac troponin T.",
              "Assessment for their potential for use was found to be alarming, with 0 (zero) biochemical markers being judged to have had suitable research and suitable for use.",
              "Six were found to be suitably researched but not suitable for practical use.",
              "Meanwhile, 18 were found to have been poorly investigated and not suitable for the application, and a further 364 biochemical markers did not have sufficient information.",
              "[15] Supra-vital Reactions Supra-vital reactions have also been proposed as a means of estimation of PMI.",
              "The determination of the supra-vitality period, therefore, can help assist in the estimation of PMI.",
              "For this method, Madea defines the PMI into four stages - the latency period, where despite stoppage of circulation, the tissue still performs aerobic respiration till the depletion of its stores \u2013 the survival period, where there is loss of tissue function, but they can be re-activated using external stimuli, e.",
              "g., electrical stimulation of nerves \u2013 the resuscitation period, where the ability of the tissue to recover is completely lost, \u2013 and the supra-vital period.",
              "Madea defines supra-vitality as the survival period of tissue after complete, irreversible ischemia.",
              "This concept states that the survival period encompasses the latency period.",

              "[5][21] The earlier a corpse is found, the more accurate the PMI estimation is likely to be.",
              "Once a corpse undergoes putrefaction, PMI can only be provided as a rough range as many variables affect the rate of these changes.",
              "[22] Estimation of PMI should not be based solely upon a single postmortem change.",
              "Instead, all the postmortem changes should be considered collectively in forming an opinion of the time since death.",
              "A sensible forensic pathologist will never provide an assessment of the specific \"time of death\" but will only offer a range of estimation of the \"time since death.\"",
              "Secondly, a doctor should also be aware of the postmortem changes to avoid misinterpretation of these findings as signs of physical violence or unnatural death.",
              "It is not uncommon for the emotionally charged legal heirs of the deceased or members of the lay public to wrongly interpret postmortem lividity for a contusion, especially in instances where death is not witnessed by them, despite assertions from a forensic pathologist.",
              "Incorrect opinions from a misinterpretation of postmortem changes for traumatic injuries during the postmortem examination may mislead the investigation in the wrong direction leading to unnecessary inquiries that may even end up in the miscarriage of justice.",
              "Two specific reasons for a doctor to know the progress of postmortem changes include: While determining the extent and timing of post-mortem changes is the purview of forensic specialists, it is incumbent on all members of the interprofessional team who come into contact with these dead patients to be somewhat familiar with the process so as not to contaminate the evidence and impede any investigations.",

              "Numerous researchers have examined various methods for estimating TSD in the past.",
              "While the results are encouraging and deemed useful, all the authors agree that there are extremely variable factors, often beyond the control of the examiner in real-life scenarios.",
              "In light of these findings, the authors advocate using multiple systems, both qualitative and quantitative, to ensure the reliability of the estimated TSD.",
              "Post-mortem interval (PMI) has traditionally been classified into immediate, early, and late stages.",
              "Immediate PMI In the immediate period, the body undergoes rapid biochemical and physiological changes that are primarily caused by the absence of circulation of blood and loss of regulatory mechanisms. These changes are principally detectable in the eyes and the skin.",
              "In the eyes, 'trucking' or segmentation of retinal blood vessels is one of the first observable signs.",
              "This sign presents as a break in the continual column of blood on ophthalmoscopic examination of the eyes and usually occurs within half an hour and may sometimes take as long as 2 hours after death.",
              "[1] The other changes in the eyes, in the immediate post-mortem phase, include loss of intraocular pressure and the clouding of the cornea.",
              "The intraocular pressure decreases drastically after death and reaches 4 mmHg or less within 6 hours after death.",
              "[2] The cornea begins to cloud within 2 hours after death and usually prevents intra-ocular examination with an ophthalmoscope.",
              "[3] The skin loses its elasticity and luster within the first few hours after death and appears pale.",
              "Histological examination of the skin, however, shows no morphological changes within 6 hours PMI.",
              "[4] Other examinations show a lack of cellular or biochemical changes within 3 to 6 hours post-mortem.",
              "[5] Emptying gastric contents is another method used for estimating the post-mortem interval.",
              "Small light meals get emptied from the stomach within 1 to 3 hours, and the time of consumption, if known \u2013 along with volume and type of meal, can be used to estimate the post-mortem interval.",
              "[6] Therefore, the immediate post-mortem phase can be termed as the post-mortem interval between somatic and cellular death, within 2 to 3 hours after death, and usually denotes a lack of discernible changes in the morphology or histo-chemistry.",
              "Early PMI The early post-mortem phase is probably the most important time period for PMI estimation, as most medico-legal cases are examined in this time period.",
              "This period is also where the estimation of time since death is most relevant in establishing the timeline of events and developing a theory of circumstances of death.",
              "This period runs from 3 to 72 hours after death.",
              "The early post-mortem phase is most frequently estimated using the classical triad of post-mortem changes \u2013 rigor mortis, livor mortis, and algor mortis.",
              "Algor Mortis Algor mortis is the cooling of the body after death, primarily due to the loss of homeostatic regulation by the hypothalamus, in conjunction with the loss of heat to the environment by conduction, convection, and radiation.",
              "Algor mortis is the most accurate method of estimating TSD in the early post-mortem phase.",
              "However, it involves a cumbersome procedure and requires intensive knowledge and research before it is accurately usable in the field;",
              "this is due to the numerous factors that affect the temperature gradient between body temperature and ambient temperature, the most inherent being the differences in the temperatures of different localities at different points of time.",
              "A rule of thumb states that there is a decrease of 1.",
              "5 degrees F every hour.",

              "[8] The estimation of TSD using algor mortis measures rectal temperatures.",
              "While they have been consistently used, nomograms for brain temperatures have also been developed by Brinkmann et al.",

              "[9] Rigor Mortis Rigor mortis is the post-mortem stiffening of muscles caused by the depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the muscles, which is necessary for the breakdown of actin-myosin filaments in the muscle fibers.",
              "Actin and myosin are components of the muscle fiber and form a bond during contraction.",
              "The cessation of oxygen supply causes the stoppage of aerobic respiration in the cells and leads to a lack of ATP production.",
              "Rigor mortis starts immediately after death and is usually seen in a sequence known as the \"march of rigor\" and Nysten's Law.",
              "While rigor mortis develops simultaneously in all muscle tissue in the body, voluntary and involuntary, the size of the muscle determines the perceptibility of changes by the examiner.",
              "Smaller muscles over the face \u2013 around the eyes, around the mouth, etc.",
              "are the muscles where rigor mortis first appears, followed by rigor mortis of the muscles in the hands and upper limbs, and finally appears in the large muscles of the lower limbs.",
              "Rigor mortis appears approximately 2 hours after death in the muscles of the face, progresses to the limbs over the next few hours, completing between 6 to 8 hours after death.",
              "[10] Rigor mortis then stays for another 12 hours (till 24 hours after death) and then disappears.",
              "[11] In the last phase of rigor mortis, the actin-myosin complex that has formed starts disintegrating due to proteolysis, resulting in the dissolution of the stiffness.",
              "This process begins in all the cells at the same time.",
              "However, just like with the appearance, this change is perceptible first in the smaller muscles of the face, followed by muscles of the upper limbs, and finally, the large muscles in the lower limbs.",
              "Rigor mortis generally disappears 36 hours after death, followed by a phase known as secondary flaccidity.",
              "Livor Mortis The final change in the classical triad is livor mortis, which is the purplish-blue discoloration of the skin in the dependent parts of the body due to the collection of blood in skin vessels caused by gravitational pull.",
              "Hypostasis develops as spots of discoloration within half an hour to 2 hours.",
              "These spots then coalesce into larger patches, which combine to form a uniform discoloration of the body's dependant parts that have not been subject to pressure, which appears from 6 to 12 hours.",
              "The discoloration becomes 'fixed' after a certain period, owing to blood cells' disintegration and hemoglobin's seepage.",
              "This fixation is confirmed by applying pressure with thumbs and is traditionally used to denote a PMI greater than 12 hours.",
              "[12] This method of estimation of PMI required an objective and modern approach, leading to the development of colorimetric methods to estimate PMI from livor mortis.",
              "[13] Histo-morphological Analysis Other methods of estimating TSD in the early phase include histo-morphological and Bio-chemical analysis.",
              "Total and differential blood counts and the microscopic morphological examination of blood have been described as a method for estimation of the TSD.",
              "All blood cells were not identifiable beyond 84 hours after death.",
              "Similarly, blood cell counts were also found to decrease beyond 84 hours after death.",
              "[5] Histological studies of the skin have shown that degenerative changes appear in the skin 6 hours after death and first appear as vacuolating the corpus basale and spinosum.",
              "Dermo-epidermal separation is seen 9 hours after death, while the dermis showed rarefaction and disintegration 6 and 18 hours after death, respectively.",
              "The glycogen in the basal membrane of the sweat glands, the secretory cells cytoplasm, and duct cells gets depleted within 3 hours PMI and leads to PAS-negative cells on histology.",
              "The basal membrane, however, continues to show a magenta staining up to 18 hours post-mortem.",
              "The eccrine sweat glands show vacuolation after 3 to 4 hours of PMI, and cells appear to have completely disintegrated 15 hours after death.",
              "The sebaceous glands appear normal till 18 hours post-mortem, seen as separating the layers and disintegrating hair papilla.",
              "[4] Studies have also shown that pleocytosis can estimate the PMI using a polynomial equation of the third order.",
              "The cells are primarily lymphocytes with a significant fraction of macrophages, which become vacuolated and unidentifiable after 12 hours.",
              "[14] Biochemical Assessment Biochemical blood assessment is non-significant in the immediate post-mortem phase due to the lack of cellular death.",
              "On the other hand, cellular death makes biochemical blood assessment in the early phase extremely difficult.",
              "Also, there is the redistribution of electrolytes from the cells into the plasma and serum, resulting in varying changes in the levels of these electrolytes.",
              "These variations and their implications are studied in the emerging field of thanato-chemistry.",
              "The biochemical assessment has been useful for estimating PMI from vitreous humor, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.",
              "Numerous factors, however, need to be accounted for when examining the PMI based on biochemistry, including, but not limited to, age, gender, biological background, lifestyle, cause of death, and a whole range of other intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",
              "Only a few biochemical markers (out of 388) were found to have had sufficient investigation with these considerations \u2013 namely potassium, sodium, urea, as well as chloride, magnesium, hypoxanthine, and cardiac troponin T.",
              "Assessment for their potential for use was found to be alarming, with 0 (zero) biochemical markers being judged to have had suitable research and suitable for use.",
              "Six were found to be suitably researched but not suitable for practical use.",
              "Meanwhile, 18 were found to have been poorly investigated and not suitable for the application, and a further 364 biochemical markers did not have sufficient information.",
              "[15] Supra-vital Reactions Supra-vital reactions have also been proposed as a means of estimation of PMI.",
              "The determination of the supra-vitality period, therefore, can help assist in the estimation of PMI.",
              "For this method, Madea defines the PMI into four stages - the latency period, where despite stoppage of circulation, the tissue still performs aerobic respiration till the depletion of its stores \u2013 the survival period, where there is loss of tissue function, but they can be re-activated using external stimuli, e.",
              "g., electrical stimulation of nerves \u2013 the resuscitation period, where the ability of the tissue to recover is completely lost, \u2013 and the supra-vital period.",
              "Madea defines supra-vitality as the survival period of tissue after complete, irreversible ischemia.",
              "This concept states that the survival period encompasses the latency period.",
              "The resuscitation period encompasses both the latency and survival periods, and the supra-vitality period includes all the other three.",
              "Supra-vitality is also different from the resuscitation period in that the tissue is excitable irrespective of recovery of function.",
              "As an example, the resuscitation period of skeletal muscle is approximated to be 2 to 3 hours, but the supravital period in some cases, may extend to 20 hours.",
              "Similarly, cardiac muscles have a resuscitation period of 3.",
              "5 to 4 min, while the supravital period may extend up to 2 hours.",
              "[16] A method for estimating the PMI was developed using the electric excitability of Orbicularis oculi using surface electrodes.",
              "A ratio of relaxation time and maximum force, called force-related relaxation time, was reliable for estimating the PMI.",
              "It is also important to consider the super-sensitivity of tissue in the immediate post-mortem phase, called Zsako's phenomenon.",
              "Therefore, the supra-vital reaction examines the idio-muscular or local contraction and not the contraction of the entire muscle.",
              "[9] Late PMI The late post-mortem phase is when the body tissue starts disintegrating and is primarily describable as decomposition or putrefaction, adipocere formation, mummification, or skeletonization.",
              "Complex tissue in the body starts disintegrating into simpler molecular forms due to the breakdown of the tissue by the body's enzyme or bacteria and bacteria that colonize the remains after death.",

              "While the results are encouraging and deemed useful, all the authors agree that there are extremely variable factors, often beyond the control of the examiner in real-life scenarios.",
              "In light of these findings, the authors advocate using multiple systems, both qualitative and quantitative, to ensure the reliability of the estimated TSD.",
              "Post-mortem interval (PMI) has traditionally been classified into immediate, early, and late stages.",
              "Immediate PMI In the immediate period, the body undergoes rapid biochemical and physiological changes that are primarily caused by the absence of circulation of blood and loss of regulatory mechanisms. These changes are principally detectable in the eyes and the skin.",
              "In the eyes, 'trucking' or segmentation of retinal blood vessels is one of the first observable signs.",
              "This sign presents as a break in the continual column of blood on ophthalmoscopic examination of the eyes and usually occurs within half an hour and may sometimes take as long as 2 hours after death.",
              "[1] The other changes in the eyes, in the immediate post-mortem phase, include loss of intraocular pressure and the clouding of the cornea.",
              "The intraocular pressure decreases drastically after death and reaches 4 mmHg or less within 6 hours after death.",
              "[2] The cornea begins to cloud within 2 hours after death and usually prevents intra-ocular examination with an ophthalmoscope.",
              "[3] The skin loses its elasticity and luster within the first few hours after death and appears pale.",
              "Histological examination of the skin, however, shows no morphological changes within 6 hours PMI.",
              "[4] Other examinations show a lack of cellular or biochemical changes within 3 to 6 hours post-mortem.",
              "[5] Emptying gastric contents is another method used for estimating the post-mortem interval.",
              "Small light meals get emptied from the stomach within 1 to 3 hours, and the time of consumption, if known \u2013 along with volume and type of meal, can be used to estimate the post-mortem interval.",
              "[6] Therefore, the immediate post-mortem phase can be termed as the post-mortem interval between somatic and cellular death, within 2 to 3 hours after death, and usually denotes a lack of discernible changes in the morphology or histo-chemistry.",
              "Early PMI The early post-mortem phase is probably the most important time period for PMI estimation, as most medico-legal cases are examined in this time period.",
              "This period is also where the estimation of time since death is most relevant in establishing the timeline of events and developing a theory of circumstances of death.",
              "This period runs from 3 to 72 hours after death.",
              "The early post-mortem phase is most frequently estimated using the classical triad of post-mortem changes \u2013 rigor mortis, livor mortis, and algor mortis.",
              "Algor Mortis Algor mortis is the cooling of the body after death, primarily due to the loss of homeostatic regulation by the hypothalamus, in conjunction with the loss of heat to the environment by conduction, convection, and radiation.",
              "Algor mortis is the most accurate method of estimating TSD in the early post-mortem phase.",
              "However, it involves a cumbersome procedure and requires intensive knowledge and research before it is accurately usable in the field;",
              "this is due to the numerous factors that affect the temperature gradient between body temperature and ambient temperature, the most inherent being the differences in the temperatures of different localities at different points of time.",
              "A rule of thumb states that there is a decrease of 1.",
              "5 degrees F every hour.",
              "[7] Several charts, formulae, and algorithms have been developed to estimate the PMI, Henssge's nomogram being the most widely taught.",
              "[8] The estimation of TSD using algor mortis measures rectal temperatures.",
              "While they have been consistently used, nomograms for brain temperatures have also been developed by Brinkmann et al.",
              "in 1976 and 1978 and by Henssge et al.",
              "in 1984.",
              "[9] Rigor Mortis Rigor mortis is the post-mortem stiffening of muscles caused by the depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the muscles, which is necessary for the breakdown of actin-myosin filaments in the muscle fibers.",
              "Actin and myosin are components of the muscle fiber and form a bond during contraction.",
              "The cessation of oxygen supply causes the stoppage of aerobic respiration in the cells and leads to a lack of ATP production.",
              "Rigor mortis starts immediately after death and is usually seen in a sequence known as the \"march of rigor\" and Nysten's Law.",
              "While rigor mortis develops simultaneously in all muscle tissue in the body, voluntary and involuntary, the size of the muscle determines the perceptibility of changes by the examiner.",
              "Smaller muscles over the face \u2013 around the eyes, around the mouth, etc.",
              "are the muscles where rigor mortis first appears, followed by rigor mortis of the muscles in the hands and upper limbs, and finally appears in the large muscles of the lower limbs.",
              "Rigor mortis appears approximately 2 hours after death in the muscles of the face, progresses to the limbs over the next few hours, completing between 6 to 8 hours after death.",
              "[10] Rigor mortis then stays for another 12 hours (till 24 hours after death) and then disappears.",
              "[11] In the last phase of rigor mortis, the actin-myosin complex that has formed starts disintegrating due to proteolysis, resulting in the dissolution of the stiffness.",
              "This process begins in all the cells at the same time.",
              "However, just like with the appearance, this change is perceptible first in the smaller muscles of the face, followed by muscles of the upper limbs, and finally, the large muscles in the lower limbs.",
              "Rigor mortis generally disappears 36 hours after death, followed by a phase known as secondary flaccidity.",
              "Livor Mortis The final change in the classical triad is livor mortis, which is the purplish-blue discoloration of the skin in the dependent parts of the body due to the collection of blood in skin vessels caused by gravitational pull.",
              "Hypostasis develops as spots of discoloration within half an hour to 2 hours.",
              "These spots then coalesce into larger patches, which combine to form a uniform discoloration of the body's dependant parts that have not been subject to pressure, which appears from 6 to 12 hours.",
              "The discoloration becomes 'fixed' after a certain period, owing to blood cells' disintegration and hemoglobin's seepage.",
              "This fixation is confirmed by applying pressure with thumbs and is traditionally used to denote a PMI greater than 12 hours.",
              "[12] This method of estimation of PMI required an objective and modern approach, leading to the development of colorimetric methods to estimate PMI from livor mortis.",
              "[13] Histo-morphological Analysis Other methods of estimating TSD in the early phase include histo-morphological and Bio-chemical analysis.",
              "Total and differential blood counts and the microscopic morphological examination of blood have been described as a method for estimation of the TSD.",
              "All blood cells were not identifiable beyond 84 hours after death.",
              "Similarly, blood cell counts were also found to decrease beyond 84 hours after death.",
              "[5] Histological studies of the skin have shown that degenerative changes appear in the skin 6 hours after death and first appear as vacuolating the corpus basale and spinosum.",
              "Dermo-epidermal separation is seen 9 hours after death, while the dermis showed rarefaction and disintegration 6 and 18 hours after death, respectively.",
              "The glycogen in the basal membrane of the sweat glands, the secretory cells cytoplasm, and duct cells gets depleted within 3 hours PMI and leads to PAS-negative cells on histology.",
              "The basal membrane, however, continues to show a magenta staining up to 18 hours post-mortem.",
              "The eccrine sweat glands show vacuolation after 3 to 4 hours of PMI, and cells appear to have completely disintegrated 15 hours after death.",
              "The sebaceous glands appear normal till 18 hours post-mortem, seen as separating the layers and disintegrating hair papilla.",
              "[4] Studies have also shown that pleocytosis can estimate the PMI using a polynomial equation of the third order.",
              "The cells are primarily lymphocytes with a significant fraction of macrophages, which become vacuolated and unidentifiable after 12 hours.",
              "[14] Biochemical Assessment Biochemical blood assessment is non-significant in the immediate post-mortem phase due to the lack of cellular death.",
              "On the other hand, cellular death makes biochemical blood assessment in the early phase extremely difficult.",
              "Also, there is the redistribution of electrolytes from the cells into the plasma and serum, resulting in varying changes in the levels of these electrolytes.",
              "These variations and their implications are studied in the emerging field of thanato-chemistry.",
              "The biochemical assessment has been useful for estimating PMI from vitreous humor, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.",
              "Numerous factors, however, need to be accounted for when examining the PMI based on biochemistry, including, but not limited to, age, gender, biological background, lifestyle, cause of death, and a whole range of other intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",
              "Only a few biochemical markers (out of 388) were found to have had sufficient investigation with these considerations \u2013 namely potassium, sodium, urea, as well as chloride, magnesium, hypoxanthine, and cardiac troponin T.",
              "Assessment for their potential for use was found to be alarming, with 0 (zero) biochemical markers being judged to have had suitable research and suitable for use.",
              "Six were found to be suitably researched but not suitable for practical use.",
              "Meanwhile, 18 were found to have been poorly investigated and not suitable for the application, and a further 364 biochemical markers did not have sufficient information.",
              "[15] Supra-vital Reactions Supra-vital reactions have also been proposed as a means of estimation of PMI.",
              "The determination of the supra-vitality period, therefore, can help assist in the estimation of PMI.",
              "For this method, Madea defines the PMI into four stages - the latency period, where despite stoppage of circulation, the tissue still performs aerobic respiration till the depletion of its stores \u2013 the survival period, where there is loss of tissue function, but they can be re-activated using external stimuli, e.",
              "g., electrical stimulation of nerves \u2013 the resuscitation period, where the ability of the tissue to recover is completely lost, \u2013 and the supra-vital period.",
              "Madea defines supra-vitality as the survival period of tissue after complete, irreversible ischemia.",
              "This concept states that the survival period encompasses the latency period.",
              "The resuscitation period encompasses both the latency and survival periods, and the supra-vitality period includes all the other three.",
              "Supra-vitality is also different from the resuscitation period in that the tissue is excitable irrespective of recovery of function.",
              "As an example, the resuscitation period of skeletal muscle is approximated to be 2 to 3 hours, but the supravital period in some cases, may extend to 20 hours.",
              "Similarly, cardiac muscles have a resuscitation period of 3.",
              "5 to 4 min, while the supravital period may extend up to 2 hours.",
              "[16] A method for estimating the PMI was developed using the electric excitability of Orbicularis oculi using surface electrodes.",
              "A ratio of relaxation time and maximum force, called force-related relaxation time, was reliable for estimating the PMI.",
              "It is also important to consider the super-sensitivity of tissue in the immediate post-mortem phase, called Zsako's phenomenon.",
              "Therefore, the supra-vital reaction examines the idio-muscular or local contraction and not the contraction of the entire muscle.",
              "[9] Late PMI The late post-mortem phase is when the body tissue starts disintegrating and is primarily describable as decomposition or putrefaction, adipocere formation, mummification, or skeletonization.",
              "Complex tissue in the body starts disintegrating into simpler molecular forms due to the breakdown of the tissue by the body's enzyme or bacteria and bacteria that colonize the remains after death.",
              "The body primarily undergoes decomposition or putrefaction, resulting in greenish discoloration, bloating due to gas formation, and liquefactive necrosis.",
              "The decomposition of remains is dependent on the climate, the season, body weight, and clothing.",
              "Decomposition can divide into five stages \u2013 fresh, early decomposition, advanced decomposition, skeletonization, and extreme decomposition.",
              "Fresh Phase The fresh phase can start as early as 24 hours and as late as 7 days after death, especially in colder winter months.",
              "This phase shows no insect activity other than the deposition of blowfly eggs in the cavities and areas of tissue dehiscence.",
              "Egg deposition has been documented in living patients, especially in immobile and debilitated subjects.",
              "[17] Early Decomposition Phase The early decomposition phase begins with the onset of skin slippage and hair loss.",
              "These changes usually begin from the first day after death to up to five days post-mortem.",
              "Maggots also begin to appear on the body, starting from the second-day post-mortem;",
              "the body appears grayish-green and marbling present (some parts of the body may still appear pinkish).",
              "The right iliac fossa is the first body part to show greenish discoloration and may be seen as early as the second-day post-mortem.",
              "This is due to the relatively superficial position of the caecum.",
              "The extremities appear brownish with the drying of the skin, especially over the fingers, nose, and ears, usually beginning on the second post-mortem day;",
              "the body appears greenish with distinct bloating.",
              "The greenish discoloration that started at the right iliac fossa progresses to encompass the entire abdomen, with concurrent bloating of the abdomen, which again may start on the second day.",
              "The bloating advances to the rest of the torso and, subsequently, the body, resulting in crepitations over the entire body on handling.",
              "This phase is also associated with purging \u2013 the release of decomposition fluid from the orifices \u2013 and a strong disagreeable odor.",
              "Bloating may be seen as early as three days after death and usually subsides by the second-week post-mortem due to disruption of the abdominal gases;",
              "The body appears blackish-green by the second week;",
              "and finally, the body appears brownish-black with a leathery appearance of skin.",
              "This stage is usually seen until the end of the first month but may be prolonged to as long as two months.",
              "The underlying tissue also appears darkened, with the texture changing to a viscous, slimy paste.",
              "Between the tenth day and the end of the first month, maggot activity continues under the leathery skin.",
              "The skin further desiccates to form a hardened leathery shell, with loss of underlying soft tissue.",
              "Advanced Decomposition Phase The advanced decomposition phase begins with the appearance of loose, sagging skin and the collapse of the abdominal cavity.",
              "The body also shows extensive maggot infestation.",
              "These changes usually appear on the fourth-day post-mortem but may begin as late as ten days after death.",
              "Loss of soft tissue, including the loss of the desiccated leathery skin, results in exposure of less than half of the skeletal material.",
              "This phase is usually associated with the presence of pupal cases, as well as the appearance of molds over the body and clothing;",
              "this usually occurs in the second month but may occur six to nine months post-mortem.",
              "Desiccation of the outer skin could accompany the structural retention of internal organs or be accompanied by autolysis and loss of internal organs.",
              "Decomposition may progress rapidly in buried remains or in remains left in an environment with high humidity, resulting in extreme maggot activity and accelerated autolysis, and could progress directly to skeletonization or adipocere formation without desiccation and mummification of the skin and outer tissue.",
              "[18] The remains may undergo either saponification or desiccation, called adipocere formation and mummification, respectively, depending on the environment and conditions present.",
              "The presence of a warm, humid environment that lacks oxygen favors the development of adipocere \u2013 a waxy substance that results from anaerobic bacterial hydrolysis of body fat.",
              "The primary organism responsible for adipocere formation is Clostridium perfringens, causing causes aggregation of crystals of fatty acid, resulting in loss of cellular detail and the loss of epidermis.",
              "[19] The formation of adipocere and the time duration depend primarily on the pH, temperature, moisture, and lack of oxygen in the environment.",
              "[20] Skeletonization Phase The skeletonization phase results in the exposure of more than half of the skeletal elements, which could still demonstrate soft tissue that is still attached.",
              "However, skeletonization is usually associated with desiccated tissue or adipocere over less than half of the body.",
              "The desiccated tissue most commonly appears at muscular or ligamental attachments along the vertebral column and ends of long bones.",
              "Meanwhile, adipocere is commonly seen over the thighs, having high subcutaneous fat deposits.",
              "This stage appears two months after the death, although it usually presents between two and nine months post-mortem.",
              "Continuation of decomposition leads to exposure of all osseous material, with only some greasy material left behind or exposing dry bones;",
              "this is usually seen after six months of exposure, although it has been reported to have occurred as early as the third week.",
              "This stage can last for years if the elements are not exposed, as is seen in buried remains or remains found indoors.",
              "Extreme Decomposition Phase The phase of extreme decomposition is seen only in remains that have been exposed to the environment and lead to erosion of the skeletal elements.",
              "This erosion begins with the process of bleaching of bones and is commonly seen six months after exposure, although it has been documented to appear as early as two months after death and as late as two and a half years post-mortem.",
              "The skeletal elements undergo further degeneration of the cortical structure, resulting in a metaphyseal loss in long bones and exposure of the cancellous part of spongy bones;",
              "this is seen commonly between a year to a year and a half after death, although it has been reported to have occurred as early as the fourth month.",
              "The metaphyseal loss was reported to have occurred at a PMI of five and a half years.",
              "[18] Forensic Entomology Forensic entomology analysis has been a routine practice for estimating PMI in the early and late post-mortem periods.",
              "There are two methods of estimation using forensic entomology \u2013 based on succession and based on development.",
              "A suitable succession model is chosen for use in a succession-based approach, one that corresponds to the environmental conditions, including the circumstances of death.",
              "Therefore, forensic research into the effect of environmental factors on decomposition and insect succession is needed.",

              "It may not be apparent in the dark-skinned.",
              "Livor mortis requires differentiation from a contusion or bruise, which occurs due to blood vessel rupture from blunt force impact and exsanguination of blood into the surrounding tissues.",
              "Rigor mortis (postmortem rigidity) is the stiffening of the muscles of the corpse due to the depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) after death with the subsequent build-up of lactate in muscle tissue resulting in an inability to release the actin-myosin bond.",
              "This postmortem muscle change appreciated grossly follows the initial phase of primary flaccidity of muscles and is itself followed by the secondary flaccidity of muscles that coincides with the beginning of putrefactive changes.",
              "The process of rigor mortis uniformly involves all muscles of the body.",
              "However, it is first apparent generally in smaller muscles such as the jaw and the eyelids due to quicker depletion of ATP relative to larger muscles in the trunk and limbs.",
              "Rigor mortis occurs in both voluntary and involuntary muscles, including the cardiac muscle.",
              "It is first evident in the facial muscles at 1 to 4 hours after death.",
              "The gelling of the muscle proteins is apparent as muscle stiffening in about 6 hours after death in the rest of the muscles and is complete about 12 hours after death.",
              "This rigidity of the muscles lasts for about another 12 hours or so.",
              "The body then returns to a flaccid state after the enzymatic breakdown of actin and myosin binding sites.",
              "The rate at which rigor mortis passes off will be rapid in a hot environment as the onset of putrefaction is hastened in such an environment.",

              "In brief, postmortem changes in the muscles include: Rigor mortis of the arrector pili muscle attached to the base of a hair follicle is also responsible for the phenomenon of cutis anserina (cutis anserine), otherwise known as postmortem goosebumps.",
              "Rigor mortis needs to be distinguished from cadaveric spasm/instantaneous rigor, which is an immediate contraction of a small group of muscles at the instance of death, seen in scenarios of violent death like in the case of drowning.",
              "Late Postmortem Changes Decomposition Two mechanisms are involved in decomposition: autolysis and putrefaction.",
              "[6] Although decomposition begins soon after death through autolysis, the macroscopic changes brought about by decomposition become apparent much later when putrefaction occurs.",
              "Autolysis is a process that occurs due to leakage of hydrolytic cellular enzymes from cells after death.",
              "The changes that occur in this process are mainly on a microscopic rather than a macroscopic level.",
              "[7] Internally, autolytic changes are most prominent in the pancreas and other organs with a high concentration of cellular enzymes.",
              "In comparison, the prostate and the non-gravid uterus take a longer duration of time to decompose.",
              "The leakage of cellular contents also leads to a suitable environment for microbes such as bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, normally present in the human microbiota, to grow and degrade surrounding tissues, which is known as the process of putrefaction.",

              "It can appear in various forms, such as putrefactive fluids and putrefactive gases.",
              "Stages of Decomposition There are five stages of decomposition, namely fresh, bloated, active decay, advanced decay, and skeletal stage.",
              "[10] These stages may occur simultaneously in different parts of the same corpse, and it may be difficult for a forensic pathologist to label the state of the corpse with a single stage.",
              "[1] The fresh stage is the immediate period following death in which autolysis occurs.",
              "Algor mortis, livor mortis, and rigor mortis are apparent in this stage.",
              "The earliest external sign of putrefaction is the greenish discoloration of the skin of the anterior abdominal wall in the right iliac fossa region.",
              "In this region of the abdomen, the caecum, loaded with semi-solid intestinal content and commensal gut bacteria, lies quite superficial.",
              "This greenish discoloration of the skin results from the formation of sulfhemoglobin facilitated by the commensal intestinal bacteria that invade the tissues after death.",
              "This skin discoloration in the right iliac fossa region appears about 18 hours after death.",
              "In temperate climates, this greening may first appear 2 to 3 days after death.",
              "The ambient temperature affects the speed of onset of putrefaction and its rate of progression.",
              "The blowflies (Calliphoridae) and flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) are often the first insects attracted to a dead body.",
              "In brief, the invasion of the body by flies and the life cycle of flies (oviposition, hatching of eggs, feeding activity of larvae or maggots, the transformation of maggots to adult flies) coincide primarily with the bloated and decay stages of decomposition.",
              "The flies may even be attracted to a dead body towards the end of the fresh stage.",
              "In the bloated stage, body parts, including organs and soft tissues, swelling due to the accumulation of putrefactive gases or other decompositional products from the putrefaction process.",
              "It usually starts in the abdomen and then slowly affects other parts, including the face, breasts, and genitals.",
              "[11][12] Also, during this stage, skin changes occur, such as blisters and slippage.",
              "Skin slippage at the extremities is known as degloving.",
              "Moreover, the phenomenon of marbling is also present during this stage, where blood vessels are visible on the skin as greenish-black streaks and eventually results in skin discoloration ranging from green to black.",
              "[4] These postmortem changes are apparent in about 24 to 48 hours after death.",
              "Active decay is a stage where putrefaction accelerates after bloating.",
              "Postmortem purging where putrefactive body fluids become forced out of body orifices is observable during this stage of decomposition.",
              "The detachment of hair or hair sloughing and black discoloration of ruptured skin are seen.",
              "Advanced decay, also called black putrefaction or late decay, is a stage where bones begin to get exposed, and the body assumes a \"caved in\" appearance.",
              "Degradation-resistant tissue such as hair (although already sloughed) and cartilage are spared up to this stage.",
              "[11][13] The skeletal stage, also called dry remains stage or skeletonization, begins when bone exposure is extensive, but the bone is yet to break down.",
              "[13][14] The remaining dried skin, cartilage, and tendons are minimal in this stage.",
              "[15] Decomposition significantly slows down at this stage, and it takes years or decades for the skeletal remains to disintegrate.",
              "The literature also reports differential decomposition involving mummification or adipocere formation.",
              "Mummification Mummification results from tissue desiccation and is a phenomenon that occurs when the corpse is in an environment that is hot and dry.",

              "Adipocere formation in the buccal pad of fat will retain the outline of the cheeks.",
              "Unlike mummification, the process of adipocere formation occurs in corpses in environments that are high in moisture.",
              "Anaerobic conditions, such as a flooded burial or submersion in water, facilitate adipocere formation.",
              "The process primarily involves hydrolysis and hydrogenation of body fats to fatty acids and soaps and adipocere formation.",
              "[17][18][19] Although reports exist of adipocere formation occurring as early as about three weeks after death, in most cases, it becomes apparent only months after death.",
              "Although early and late postmortem changes are heralded as definite signs of death in traditional textbooks, in practical reality, they are not criteria in considering the diagnosis of death.",
              "Nevertheless, the immediate postmortem changes are clinically significant in diagnosing death.",
              "In the context of the determination of death, the condition known as suspended animation or apparent death should also merit consideration.",
              "Suspended animation is a condition where the person appears to be dead because the vital conditions are at such a low pitch as to be minimum compatible with life.",
              "This condition may occur in a person fished out of water or hypothermia.",
              "In such situations, doctors erroneously declaring a patient dead is a huge embarrassment.",
              "Nonetheless, the literature contains reports of cases of wrongful declaration of death.",
              "[20] The early and late postmortem changes are significant from a forensic perspective in primarily estimating the time since death or PMI.",
              "Forensic Significance Postmortem interval (PMI) is the time that has passed since the death of a person until found, is an essential tool in forensic investigations as providing an estimated time since death, is pivotal in judicial cases and can even either incriminate or acquit a suspect.",
              "Understanding the appearance and progression of the postmortem changes is essential in estimating the PMI.",
              "[5][21] The earlier a corpse is found, the more accurate the PMI estimation is likely to be.",

              "Immediate PMI In the immediate period, the body undergoes rapid biochemical and physiological changes that are primarily caused by the absence of circulation of blood and loss of regulatory mechanisms. These changes are principally detectable in the eyes and the skin.",
              "In the eyes, 'trucking' or segmentation of retinal blood vessels is one of the first observable signs.",
              "This sign presents as a break in the continual column of blood on ophthalmoscopic examination of the eyes and usually occurs within half an hour and may sometimes take as long as 2 hours after death.",

              "The intraocular pressure decreases drastically after death and reaches 4 mmHg or less within 6 hours after death.",
              "[2] The cornea begins to cloud within 2 hours after death and usually prevents intra-ocular examination with an ophthalmoscope.",
              "[3] The skin loses its elasticity and luster within the first few hours after death and appears pale.",
              "Histological examination of the skin, however, shows no morphological changes within 6 hours PMI.",
              "[4] Other examinations show a lack of cellular or biochemical changes within 3 to 6 hours post-mortem.",
              "[5] Emptying gastric contents is another method used for estimating the post-mortem interval.",
              "Small light meals get emptied from the stomach within 1 to 3 hours, and the time of consumption, if known \u2013 along with volume and type of meal, can be used to estimate the post-mortem interval.",
              "[6] Therefore, the immediate post-mortem phase can be termed as the post-mortem interval between somatic and cellular death, within 2 to 3 hours after death, and usually denotes a lack of discernible changes in the morphology or histo-chemistry.",
              "Early PMI The early post-mortem phase is probably the most important time period for PMI estimation, as most medico-legal cases are examined in this time period.",
              "This period is also where the estimation of time since death is most relevant in establishing the timeline of events and developing a theory of circumstances of death.",
              "This period runs from 3 to 72 hours after death.",
              "The early post-mortem phase is most frequently estimated using the classical triad of post-mortem changes \u2013 rigor mortis, livor mortis, and algor mortis.",

              "[9] Rigor Mortis Rigor mortis is the post-mortem stiffening of muscles caused by the depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the muscles, which is necessary for the breakdown of actin-myosin filaments in the muscle fibers.",
              "Actin and myosin are components of the muscle fiber and form a bond during contraction.",
              "The cessation of oxygen supply causes the stoppage of aerobic respiration in the cells and leads to a lack of ATP production.",

              "are the muscles where rigor mortis first appears, followed by rigor mortis of the muscles in the hands and upper limbs, and finally appears in the large muscles of the lower limbs.",
              "Rigor mortis appears approximately 2 hours after death in the muscles of the face, progresses to the limbs over the next few hours, completing between 6 to 8 hours after death.",
              "[10] Rigor mortis then stays for another 12 hours (till 24 hours after death) and then disappears.",
              "[11] In the last phase of rigor mortis, the actin-myosin complex that has formed starts disintegrating due to proteolysis, resulting in the dissolution of the stiffness.",
              "This process begins in all the cells at the same time.",
              "However, just like with the appearance, this change is perceptible first in the smaller muscles of the face, followed by muscles of the upper limbs, and finally, the large muscles in the lower limbs.",
              "Rigor mortis generally disappears 36 hours after death, followed by a phase known as secondary flaccidity.",
              "Livor Mortis The final change in the classical triad is livor mortis, which is the purplish-blue discoloration of the skin in the dependent parts of the body due to the collection of blood in skin vessels caused by gravitational pull.",
              "Hypostasis develops as spots of discoloration within half an hour to 2 hours.",
              "These spots then coalesce into larger patches, which combine to form a uniform discoloration of the body's dependant parts that have not been subject to pressure, which appears from 6 to 12 hours.",
              "The discoloration becomes 'fixed' after a certain period, owing to blood cells' disintegration and hemoglobin's seepage.",
              "This fixation is confirmed by applying pressure with thumbs and is traditionally used to denote a PMI greater than 12 hours.",
              "[12] This method of estimation of PMI required an objective and modern approach, leading to the development of colorimetric methods to estimate PMI from livor mortis.",
              "[13] Histo-morphological Analysis Other methods of estimating TSD in the early phase include histo-morphological and Bio-chemical analysis.",
              "Total and differential blood counts and the microscopic morphological examination of blood have been described as a method for estimation of the TSD.",
              "All blood cells were not identifiable beyond 84 hours after death.",
              "Similarly, blood cell counts were also found to decrease beyond 84 hours after death.",
              "[5] Histological studies of the skin have shown that degenerative changes appear in the skin 6 hours after death and first appear as vacuolating the corpus basale and spinosum.",
              "Dermo-epidermal separation is seen 9 hours after death, while the dermis showed rarefaction and disintegration 6 and 18 hours after death, respectively.",
              "The glycogen in the basal membrane of the sweat glands, the secretory cells cytoplasm, and duct cells gets depleted within 3 hours PMI and leads to PAS-negative cells on histology.",
              "The basal membrane, however, continues to show a magenta staining up to 18 hours post-mortem.",
              "The eccrine sweat glands show vacuolation after 3 to 4 hours of PMI, and cells appear to have completely disintegrated 15 hours after death.",
              "The sebaceous glands appear normal till 18 hours post-mortem, seen as separating the layers and disintegrating hair papilla.",
              "[4] Studies have also shown that pleocytosis can estimate the PMI using a polynomial equation of the third order.",
              "The cells are primarily lymphocytes with a significant fraction of macrophages, which become vacuolated and unidentifiable after 12 hours.",
              "[14] Biochemical Assessment Biochemical blood assessment is non-significant in the immediate post-mortem phase due to the lack of cellular death.",
              "On the other hand, cellular death makes biochemical blood assessment in the early phase extremely difficult.",
              "Also, there is the redistribution of electrolytes from the cells into the plasma and serum, resulting in varying changes in the levels of these electrolytes.",
              "These variations and their implications are studied in the emerging field of thanato-chemistry.",
              "The biochemical assessment has been useful for estimating PMI from vitreous humor, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.",
              "Numerous factors, however, need to be accounted for when examining the PMI based on biochemistry, including, but not limited to, age, gender, biological background, lifestyle, cause of death, and a whole range of other intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",
              "Only a few biochemical markers (out of 388) were found to have had sufficient investigation with these considerations \u2013 namely potassium, sodium, urea, as well as chloride, magnesium, hypoxanthine, and cardiac troponin T.",
              "Assessment for their potential for use was found to be alarming, with 0 (zero) biochemical markers being judged to have had suitable research and suitable for use.",
              "Six were found to be suitably researched but not suitable for practical use.",
              "Meanwhile, 18 were found to have been poorly investigated and not suitable for the application, and a further 364 biochemical markers did not have sufficient information.",
              "[15] Supra-vital Reactions Supra-vital reactions have also been proposed as a means of estimation of PMI.",
              "The determination of the supra-vitality period, therefore, can help assist in the estimation of PMI.",
              "For this method, Madea defines the PMI into four stages - the latency period, where despite stoppage of circulation, the tissue still performs aerobic respiration till the depletion of its stores \u2013 the survival period, where there is loss of tissue function, but they can be re-activated using external stimuli, e.",
              "g., electrical stimulation of nerves \u2013 the resuscitation period, where the ability of the tissue to recover is completely lost, \u2013 and the supra-vital period.",
              "Madea defines supra-vitality as the survival period of tissue after complete, irreversible ischemia.",
              "This concept states that the survival period encompasses the latency period.",
              "The resuscitation period encompasses both the latency and survival periods, and the supra-vitality period includes all the other three.",
              "Supra-vitality is also different from the resuscitation period in that the tissue is excitable irrespective of recovery of function.",
              "As an example, the resuscitation period of skeletal muscle is approximated to be 2 to 3 hours, but the supravital period in some cases, may extend to 20 hours.",
              "Similarly, cardiac muscles have a resuscitation period of 3.",
              "5 to 4 min, while the supravital period may extend up to 2 hours.",
              "[16] A method for estimating the PMI was developed using the electric excitability of Orbicularis oculi using surface electrodes.",
              "A ratio of relaxation time and maximum force, called force-related relaxation time, was reliable for estimating the PMI.",
              "It is also important to consider the super-sensitivity of tissue in the immediate post-mortem phase, called Zsako's phenomenon.",
              "Therefore, the supra-vital reaction examines the idio-muscular or local contraction and not the contraction of the entire muscle.",
              "[9] Late PMI The late post-mortem phase is when the body tissue starts disintegrating and is primarily describable as decomposition or putrefaction, adipocere formation, mummification, or skeletonization.",
              "Complex tissue in the body starts disintegrating into simpler molecular forms due to the breakdown of the tissue by the body's enzyme or bacteria and bacteria that colonize the remains after death.",
              "The body primarily undergoes decomposition or putrefaction, resulting in greenish discoloration, bloating due to gas formation, and liquefactive necrosis.",
              "The decomposition of remains is dependent on the climate, the season, body weight, and clothing.",
              "Decomposition can divide into five stages \u2013 fresh, early decomposition, advanced decomposition, skeletonization, and extreme decomposition.",
              "Fresh Phase The fresh phase can start as early as 24 hours and as late as 7 days after death, especially in colder winter months.",
              "This phase shows no insect activity other than the deposition of blowfly eggs in the cavities and areas of tissue dehiscence.",
              "Egg deposition has been documented in living patients, especially in immobile and debilitated subjects.",
              "[17] Early Decomposition Phase The early decomposition phase begins with the onset of skin slippage and hair loss.",
              "These changes usually begin from the first day after death to up to five days post-mortem.",
              "Maggots also begin to appear on the body, starting from the second-day post-mortem;",
              "the body appears grayish-green and marbling present (some parts of the body may still appear pinkish).",
              "The right iliac fossa is the first body part to show greenish discoloration and may be seen as early as the second-day post-mortem.",
              "This is due to the relatively superficial position of the caecum.",
              "The extremities appear brownish with the drying of the skin, especially over the fingers, nose, and ears, usually beginning on the second post-mortem day;",
              "the body appears greenish with distinct bloating.",
              "The greenish discoloration that started at the right iliac fossa progresses to encompass the entire abdomen, with concurrent bloating of the abdomen, which again may start on the second day.",
              "The bloating advances to the rest of the torso and, subsequently, the body, resulting in crepitations over the entire body on handling.",
              "This phase is also associated with purging \u2013 the release of decomposition fluid from the orifices \u2013 and a strong disagreeable odor.",
              "Bloating may be seen as early as three days after death and usually subsides by the second-week post-mortem due to disruption of the abdominal gases;",
              "The body appears blackish-green by the second week;",
              "and finally, the body appears brownish-black with a leathery appearance of skin.",
              "This stage is usually seen until the end of the first month but may be prolonged to as long as two months.",
              "The underlying tissue also appears darkened, with the texture changing to a viscous, slimy paste.",
              "Between the tenth day and the end of the first month, maggot activity continues under the leathery skin.",
              "The skin further desiccates to form a hardened leathery shell, with loss of underlying soft tissue.",
              "Advanced Decomposition Phase The advanced decomposition phase begins with the appearance of loose, sagging skin and the collapse of the abdominal cavity.",
              "The body also shows extensive maggot infestation.",
              "These changes usually appear on the fourth-day post-mortem but may begin as late as ten days after death.",
              "Loss of soft tissue, including the loss of the desiccated leathery skin, results in exposure of less than half of the skeletal material.",
              "This phase is usually associated with the presence of pupal cases, as well as the appearance of molds over the body and clothing;",
              "this usually occurs in the second month but may occur six to nine months post-mortem.",
              "Desiccation of the outer skin could accompany the structural retention of internal organs or be accompanied by autolysis and loss of internal organs.",
              "Decomposition may progress rapidly in buried remains or in remains left in an environment with high humidity, resulting in extreme maggot activity and accelerated autolysis, and could progress directly to skeletonization or adipocere formation without desiccation and mummification of the skin and outer tissue.",
              "[18] The remains may undergo either saponification or desiccation, called adipocere formation and mummification, respectively, depending on the environment and conditions present.",
              "The presence of a warm, humid environment that lacks oxygen favors the development of adipocere \u2013 a waxy substance that results from anaerobic bacterial hydrolysis of body fat.",
              "The primary organism responsible for adipocere formation is Clostridium perfringens, causing causes aggregation of crystals of fatty acid, resulting in loss of cellular detail and the loss of epidermis.",
              "[19] The formation of adipocere and the time duration depend primarily on the pH, temperature, moisture, and lack of oxygen in the environment.",
              "[20] Skeletonization Phase The skeletonization phase results in the exposure of more than half of the skeletal elements, which could still demonstrate soft tissue that is still attached.",
              "However, skeletonization is usually associated with desiccated tissue or adipocere over less than half of the body.",
              "The desiccated tissue most commonly appears at muscular or ligamental attachments along the vertebral column and ends of long bones.",
              "Meanwhile, adipocere is commonly seen over the thighs, having high subcutaneous fat deposits.",
              "This stage appears two months after the death, although it usually presents between two and nine months post-mortem.",
              "Continuation of decomposition leads to exposure of all osseous material, with only some greasy material left behind or exposing dry bones;",
              "this is usually seen after six months of exposure, although it has been reported to have occurred as early as the third week.",
              "This stage can last for years if the elements are not exposed, as is seen in buried remains or remains found indoors.",
              "Extreme Decomposition Phase The phase of extreme decomposition is seen only in remains that have been exposed to the environment and lead to erosion of the skeletal elements.",
              "This erosion begins with the process of bleaching of bones and is commonly seen six months after exposure, although it has been documented to appear as early as two months after death and as late as two and a half years post-mortem.",
              "The skeletal elements undergo further degeneration of the cortical structure, resulting in a metaphyseal loss in long bones and exposure of the cancellous part of spongy bones;",

              "A suitable succession model is chosen for use in a succession-based approach, one that corresponds to the environmental conditions, including the circumstances of death.",
              "Therefore, forensic research into the effect of environmental factors on decomposition and insect succession is needed.",

              "To investigate practical (field) application, eventual interferences, and/or synergetic effects, as well as the robustness of these methods towards specific influencing factors, a field study was conducted, using eight pig cadavers of different body weights and physical coverage, left to decompose under natural conditions for 16 days.",
              "Morphological changes during decomposition were assessed using the total body score (TBS), muscle samples were collected to analyze protein degradation, and insect colonization was evaluated.",
              "The results reveal strengths and current limitations of all tested methods, as well as promising synergistic effects, and thus, provide a baseline for targeted future research.",
              "To estimate the time since death, or postmortem interval (PMI), as precisely as possible is a central, yet very complex aspect in forensic pathology [1].",
              "Most of the available methods to date, such as the comparison of body core and environmental temperature [2], analysis of rigor and livor mortis [3], or the assessment of supravital phenomena [4], are more or less restricted to specific circumstances of death, dependent on the stage of decay or limited to certain postmortem timeframes.",
              "However, in early-stages postmortem, a combination of these approaches allows a more reliable estimation of the PMI [5, 6].",
              "In later stages, the life cycle of necrophagous insects developing on the body [7], the analysis of tissue degradation [8\u201310], or morphological changes [11] of a dead body can contribute to exclude specific timeframes or provide minimum postmortem intervals (PMImin).",
              "However, these methods can only be applied under specific circumstances (mere presence of insects, or remaining tissue, no exclusion criteria such as myiasis [12, 13], or altered in vivo tissue metabolism [14], etc.)",
              "and only little is known about how the investigated phenomena influence each other.",
              "In fact, PMI estimation in forensic practice is often an exclusion process of available methods, which ultimately can lead to unsatisfactory outcome due to poor reliability and/or accuracy.",
              "This problem is most acute in the late PMI, when decomposition advances and most of the abovementioned methods are no longer useful.",
              "Human decomposition is a very complex process due to the interaction of different biological and chemical components [15].",
              "Up to date, a unique decomposition model cannot match all potential forensic cases because of highly variable decomposition processes taking place in response to the effect of extrinsic- or intrinsic-influencing factors.",
              "Extrinsic factors include environmental conditions (e.",
              "g., temperature, moisture, clothing, concealment, weather, and insect activity), while intrinsic factors are mostly related to the cause and manner of death and the characteristics of the human body (body mass, age, gender, injuries, or medical treatments) [15\u201319].",
              "Of these, temperature and humidity are considered among the most significant variables affecting the rate of decomposition [20].",
              "Currently, several methods are expected to assist in the estimation of the PMI in the advanced stages of decomposition such as forensic entomology [21], the skeletal muscle protein degradation [10], and the classification of decomposition morphology by the means of a total body score (TBS) [11].",
              "However, the reliability of these methods is also affected by several sources of inaccuracy, mostly related to biotic (bacteria, plants, scavengers) and abiotic (rainfall, ventilation, soil) factors.",
              "Moreover, they are validated to varying degrees.",
              "Temperature, environment, and access for insects are well known as the most important variables influencing degradation or preservation of soft tissues [21, 22].",
              "Hence, forensic entomology, e.",
              "g., although a well-established method of estimating the PMI via the age of the insects developing on the body, is only capable of providing a minimum PMI (PMImin) as insects do not always have immediate access to the corpse and might colonize it with delay.",
              "Succession of insect species occurring on cadavers can follow a regular pattern and as such be used as a manual for timeline data which, depending on the case, can additionally narrow down time period [23].",
              "However, application can be delicate, as some species depict a random occurrence pattern and do not necessarily follow the predicted succession [24].",
              "Moreover, community structure and arrival patterns as well as associated decomposition rates can as well alter the access for insects [25].",
              "The study of skeletal muscle protein decay is promising [10] and offers some advantages: its immediate use following death, the high abundance of muscle tissue in human bodies, and the ease of sampling.",
              "Although this method has already proven its potential in human application [26, 27], it requires additional validation, especially on behalf of possible influencing factors.",
              "Last but not the least, decomposition scoring systems are still of little help in forensic practice [28, 29].",
              "In fact, the regression equations developed from such decomposition scores seem to be useful only if applied to bodies exposed to exactly the same experimental conditions as to which they have been tested.",
              "In case work, there is often a certain time point of interest, such as if a person died before or after a specific date.",
              "In combination with the numerous variations of the circumstances of death, this requires a tool-box of methods to select the most appropriate ones for case-specific application.",
              "Some methods have to be excluded under certain circumstances, under which other approaches work just fine.",
              "Ultimately, merging and combining several methods can improve the overall accuracy of the estimation, just as used in the compound method for early-period PMI estimation [5, 6].",

              "The reasons for this can be complex.",
              "The majority of entomological samplings worked well, especially for the exposed, naked pigs, but it was much more difficult for the dressed carcasses and the pigs under brushwood.",
              "Another limiting factor could be some lack of experience of the collectors.",
              "Although the practical training in sample collection, received by the assessors, was adequate for crime scene application, additional preparation towards possible scientific challenges could have been beneficial.",

              "A resulting low number of species subsequently leads to reduced possibilities for PMImin calculations.",
              "For estimations and reports, caution is required when applying succession and so-called pre-appearance data, the latter mainly introduced by Matuszewski and colleagues in the last decade [37, 46, 51, 52].",

              "e., the fact that there can be a delayed colonization, causes the entomological clock to start running one to several days later.",
              "Qualitative changes of protein band patterns such as occurring degradation products or the loss of native protein bands can be valuable clues for PMI estimation.",
              "However, to date, there is only limited reference data for humans [26] and available data regarding the porcine animal model exclusively originate from controlled laboratory studies [10].",
              "To provide further reference data, we tested the method in uncontrolled field conditions by comparing results of this animal study to already available reference data from controlled environments.",
              "To additionally improve the applicability of the method in field conditions, we were able to adapt sampling and sample processing for routine practice.",
              "Comparing degradation patterns of tropomyosin, this protein turned out to be very stable towards decomposition, as it has been shown previously for humans and pigs [10, 26].",
              "The significant loss of native cardiac troponin T (cTnT) after day 5, in comparison, partly contradicts previously described results in pigs, where this change occurred after 9 to 10 days postmortem at 21 \u00b0C under controlled laboratory conditions [10].",
              "The exact reason why no native bands of desmin were detectable remains unclear.",
              "This deviation from usually seen results can be due to adaptations of sample processing to enable efficient application of the method in field conditions.",
              "Instead of fixing the biopsy samples with liquid nitrogen, which should be the method of choice to immediately end autolytic processes and thus preserve the degradation status, a chemical preservation with RIPA buffer including protease inhibitor was used.",
              "Although this protocol obviously had no effect on the detection of other proteins, a negative reaction with native desmin cannot be excluded and remains to be further tested.",
              "As far as valid interpretation is possible, the absence of native desmin did not affect the occurrence of desmin degradation products.",
              "While desmin fragments were detected in all samples with increasing frequency from day 3 to day 5, similar degradation products have been reported after 1 to 2 days in pigs stored at 21 \u00b0C [10] and after a few hours in humans when ADD is back-calculated to PMI with 20 \u00b0C assumed [26].",
              "Divergences such as temporal deviations of absence or presence of certain bands can be partly explained by a lower mean temperature in the field experiment (just over 17 \u00b0C during the first 5 days).",
              "The much higher humidity (usually near saturation due to regular rainfalls vs. 35 \u00b1 5% relative humidity in lab experiments) in combination with the fact that in lab experiments explanted legs were used (drying is promoted by large areas without protecting skin) might also cause altered temporal degradation pattern as seen for cTnT.",
              "A further interference factor was represented by increased insect activity with a consequent excessive loss of tissue and thus unavailability to analyze proteins.",
              "Notably, all samples taken after day 5 (n = 4) depicted low protein concentrations and comparably weak bands in all proteins analyzed.",
              "In the case of cTnT, together with a high humidity, this could explain the earlier loss of native bands in comparison with previous lab experiments.",
              "In practice, the disappearance of native proteins and protein fragments depicts only a minor problem for statistical modeling or the application for PMI estimation, as it could only be applied for present degradation products.",
              "If no degradation products (e.",
              "g., of desmin) were detected in a certain case scenario, other proteins would have to be used to conclude a PMI (e.",
              "g., cTnT).",
              "The phenomenon of transiently occurring degradation products as it was found for desmin fragments in this study, however, has to be considered for fragments of other proteins as well, thus underling the importance of positive control proteins (such as tropomyosin).",
              "To our knowledge, this is the first experimental series analyzing vinculin degradation in pigs on a quantitative basis.",
              "Indeed, the present results show the potential of this protein for future application in PMI estimations.",
              "Especially, the loss of the meta-vinculin band, occurring at day 3 in all animals, confirms the results of previous pilot experiments on pigs and humans [53] and quantitative experiments on rats [54].",
              "Also, the loss of native vinculin and the appearance of degradation products have been reported [53, 54].",
              "However, in this particular study, these changes occurred in the later stages of the experimental series in which only a small sample size was available, thus producing large confidence intervals.",
              "Additional experiments are necessary to test the applicability for future practice.",
              "The results of this experiment depict the potential of muscle tissue (protein) degradation analysis for PMI estimation, particularly within the first 5 to 10 days.",
              "This is especially underlined by the finding that protein degradation was largely robust towards the individual influencing factors body weight and exposure.",
              "However, at the same time, differences to previous results show the importance to further investigate the effect of factors such as temperature and humidity in detail.",
              "This pilot field study partly met the objectives to compare the applicability of methods for PMI estimation in advanced decomposition stages.",
              "Strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of morphological scoring methods (TBS), tissue decomposition (skeletal muscle protein degradation), and forensic entomology were clearly revealed, underlining the current restrictions and future challenges in this field.",
              "Morphological methods and skeletal muscle protein degradation produced fairly consistent data within the first 5 days.",
              "Afterwards, morphological changes were found to be highly variable upon individual influences, even under the same environmental conditions.",
              "Protein analysis was largely robust to individual influences;",
              "however, it could no longer be applied in some of the carcasses after day 7 due to indirect environmental influences (promoting insect colonization and a resulting loss of tissue).",
              "When tissue was preserved, due to less insect activity, protein analysis provided valuable results even until day 14.",
              "On the contrary, from carcasses lacking tissue after a couple of days, a sufficient amount of fly specimens was available for forensic entomological analysis and the estimation of a minimum PMI (PMImin), demonstrating a valuable complementary effect of entomology and protein analysis.",
              "In this field study, forensic entomology could not provide evident data in the early postmortem period, but became increasingly important, and ultimately the last sufficiently applicable approach.",
              "Valuable PMImin estimations were obtained mainly by analysis of larval stages of blow flies.",
              "However, to date, no reliable reference data exists for some of the most abundant species in this study.",
              "In practical case work, a recommended approach might be to use data from closely related species.",
              "However, it has to be ensured that both the species (one from which the reference data derived and one for which calculations are be made) have similar geographic origins [55].",
              "A combination of the applied methods could not increase the overall accuracy of PMI estimations, but having various techniques available covered a significantly larger time period compared with an individual approach.",
              "Future studies on all three methods are required to (i) investigate (additional) influencing factors, (ii) increase reference data, and (iii) further investigate respective interactions in both, the animal model and humans, to be able to provide a sufficient tool-box for a broad application spectrum in forensic case work.",

              "To estimate the time since death, or postmortem interval (PMI), as precisely as possible is a central, yet very complex aspect in forensic pathology [1].",
              "Most of the available methods to date, such as the comparison of body core and environmental temperature [2], analysis of rigor and livor mortis [3], or the assessment of supravital phenomena [4], are more or less restricted to specific circumstances of death, dependent on the stage of decay or limited to certain postmortem timeframes.",
              "However, in early-stages postmortem, a combination of these approaches allows a more reliable estimation of the PMI [5, 6].",
              "In later stages, the life cycle of necrophagous insects developing on the body [7], the analysis of tissue degradation [8,9,10], or morphological changes [11] of a dead body can contribute to exclude specific timeframes or provide minimum postmortem intervals (PMImin).",
              "However, these methods can only be applied under specific circumstances (mere presence of insects, or remaining tissue, no exclusion criteria such as myiasis [12, 13], or altered in vivo tissue metabolism [14], etc.)",
              "and only little is known about how the investigated phenomena influence each other.",
              "In fact, PMI estimation in forensic practice is often an exclusion process of available methods, which ultimately can lead to unsatisfactory outcome due to poor reliability and/or accuracy.",
              "This problem is most acute in the late PMI, when decomposition advances and most of the abovementioned methods are no longer useful.",
              "Human decomposition is a very complex process due to the interaction of different biological and chemical components [15].",
              "Up to date, a unique decomposition model cannot match all potential forensic cases because of highly variable decomposition processes taking place in response to the effect of extrinsic- or intrinsic-influencing factors.",
              "Extrinsic factors include environmental conditions (e.",
              "g., temperature, moisture, clothing, concealment, weather, and insect activity), while intrinsic factors are mostly related to the cause and manner of death and the characteristics of the human body (body mass, age, gender, injuries, or medical treatments) [15,16,17,18,19].",
              "Of these, temperature and humidity are considered among the most significant variables affecting the rate of decomposition [20].",
              "Currently, several methods are expected to assist in the estimation of the PMI in the advanced stages of decomposition such as forensic entomology [21], the skeletal muscle protein degradation [10], and the classification of decomposition morphology by the means of a total body score (TBS) [11].",
              "However, the reliability of these methods is also affected by several sources of inaccuracy, mostly related to biotic (bacteria, plants, scavengers) and abiotic (rainfall, ventilation, soil) factors.",
              "Moreover, they are validated to varying degrees.",
              "Temperature, environment, and access for insects are well known as the most important variables influencing degradation or preservation of soft tissues [21, 22].",

              "g., although a well-established method of estimating the PMI via the age of the insects developing on the body, is only capable of providing a minimum PMI (PMImin) as insects do not always have immediate access to the corpse and might colonize it with delay.",
              "Succession of insect species occurring on cadavers can follow a regular pattern and as such be used as a manual for timeline data which, depending on the case, can additionally narrow down time period [23].",

              "Moreover, community structure and arrival patterns as well as associated decomposition rates can as well alter the access for insects [25].",
              "The study of skeletal muscle protein decay is promising [10] and offers some advantages: its immediate use following death, the high abundance of muscle tissue in human bodies, and the ease of sampling.",
              "Although this method has already proven its potential in human application [26, 27], it requires additional validation, especially on behalf of possible influencing factors.",
              "Last but not the least, decomposition scoring systems are still of little help in forensic practice [28, 29].",
              "In fact, the regression equations developed from such decomposition scores seem to be useful only if applied to bodies exposed to exactly the same experimental conditions as to which they have been tested.",
              "In case work, there is often a certain time point of interest, such as if a person died before or after a specific date.",
              "In combination with the numerous variations of the circumstances of death, this requires a tool-box of methods to select the most appropriate ones for case-specific application.",
              "Some methods have to be excluded under certain circumstances, under which other approaches work just fine.",
              "Ultimately, merging and combining several methods can improve the overall accuracy of the estimation, just as used in the compound method for early-period PMI estimation [5, 6].",

              "Divergences such as temporal deviations of absence or presence of certain bands can be partly explained by a lower mean temperature in the field experiment (just over 17 \u00b0C during the first 5 days).",
              "The much higher humidity (usually near saturation due to regular rainfalls vs. 35 \u00b1 5% relative humidity in lab experiments) in combination with the fact that in lab experiments explanted legs were used (drying is promoted by large areas without protecting skin) might also cause altered temporal degradation pattern as seen for cTnT.",
              "A further interference factor was represented by increased insect activity with a consequent excessive loss of tissue and thus unavailability to analyze proteins.",
              "Notably, all samples taken after day 5 (n = 4) depicted low protein concentrations and comparably weak bands in all proteins analyzed.",
              "In the case of cTnT, together with a high humidity, this could explain the earlier loss of native bands in comparison with previous lab experiments.",

              "This is especially underlined by the finding that protein degradation was largely robust towards the individual influencing factors body weight and exposure.",

              "however, it could no longer be applied in some of the carcasses after day 7 due to indirect environmental influences (promoting insect colonization and a resulting loss of tissue).",
              "When tissue was preserved, due to less insect activity, protein analysis provided valuable results even until day 14.",
              "On the contrary, from carcasses lacking tissue after a couple of days, a sufficient amount of fly specimens was available for forensic entomological analysis and the estimation of a minimum PMI (PMImin), demonstrating a valuable complementary effect of entomology and protein analysis.",
              "In this field study, forensic entomology could not provide evident data in the early postmortem period, but became increasingly important, and ultimately the last sufficiently applicable approach.",
              "Valuable PMImin estimations were obtained mainly by analysis of larval stages of blow flies.",
              "However, to date, no reliable reference data exists for some of the most abundant species in this study.",
              "In practical case work, a recommended approach might be to use data from closely related species.",
              "However, it has to be ensured that both the species (one from which the reference data derived and one for which calculations are be made) have similar geographic origins [55].",
              "A combination of the applied methods could not increase the overall accuracy of PMI estimations, but having various techniques available covered a significantly larger time period compared with an individual approach.",
              "Future studies on all three methods are required to (i) investigate (additional) influencing factors, (ii) increase reference data, and (iii) further investigate respective interactions in both, the animal model and humans, to be able to provide a sufficient tool-box for a broad application spectrum in forensic case work.",

              "Numerous researchers have examined various methods for estimating TSD in the past.",
              "While the results are encouraging and deemed useful, all the authors agree that there are extremely variable factors, often beyond the control of the examiner in real-life scenarios.",
              "In light of these findings, the authors advocate using multiple systems, both qualitative and quantitative, to ensure the reliability of the estimated TSD.",
              "Post-mortem interval (PMI) has traditionally been classified into immediate, early, and late stages.",
              "Immediate PMI In the immediate period, the body undergoes rapid biochemical and physiological changes that are primarily caused by the absence of circulation of blood and loss of regulatory mechanisms. These changes are principally detectable in the eyes and the skin.",
              "In the eyes, 'trucking' or segmentation of retinal blood vessels is one of the first observable signs.",
              "This sign presents as a break in the continual column of blood on ophthalmoscopic examination of the eyes and usually occurs within half an hour and may sometimes take as long as 2 hours after death.",
              "[1] The other changes in the eyes, in the immediate post-mortem phase, include loss of intraocular pressure and the clouding of the cornea.",
              "The intraocular pressure decreases drastically after death and reaches 4 mmHg or less within 6 hours after death.",
              "[2] The cornea begins to cloud within 2 hours after death and usually prevents intra-ocular examination with an ophthalmoscope.",
              "[3] The skin loses its elasticity and luster within the first few hours after death and appears pale.",
              "Histological examination of the skin, however, shows no morphological changes within 6 hours PMI.",
              "[4] Other examinations show a lack of cellular or biochemical changes within 3 to 6 hours post-mortem.",
              "[5] Emptying gastric contents is another method used for estimating the post-mortem interval.",
              "Small light meals get emptied from the stomach within 1 to 3 hours, and the time of consumption, if known \u2013 along with volume and type of meal, can be used to estimate the post-mortem interval.",
              "[6] Therefore, the immediate post-mortem phase can be termed as the post-mortem interval between somatic and cellular death, within 2 to 3 hours after death, and usually denotes a lack of discernible changes in the morphology or histo-chemistry.",
              "Early PMI The early post-mortem phase is probably the most important time period for PMI estimation, as most medico-legal cases are examined in this time period.",
              "This period is also where the estimation of time since death is most relevant in establishing the timeline of events and developing a theory of circumstances of death.",
              "This period runs from 3 to 72 hours after death.",
              "The early post-mortem phase is most frequently estimated using the classical triad of post-mortem changes \u2013 rigor mortis, livor mortis, and algor mortis.",
              "Algor Mortis Algor mortis is the cooling of the body after death, primarily due to the loss of homeostatic regulation by the hypothalamus, in conjunction with the loss of heat to the environment by conduction, convection, and radiation.",
              "Algor mortis is the most accurate method of estimating TSD in the early post-mortem phase.",
              "However, it involves a cumbersome procedure and requires intensive knowledge and research before it is accurately usable in the field;",
              "this is due to the numerous factors that affect the temperature gradient between body temperature and ambient temperature, the most inherent being the differences in the temperatures of different localities at different points of time.",
              "A rule of thumb states that there is a decrease of 1.",
              "5 degrees F every hour.",
              "[7] Several charts, formulae, and algorithms have been developed to estimate the PMI, Henssge's nomogram being the most widely taught.",
              "[8] The estimation of TSD using algor mortis measures rectal temperatures.",
              "While they have been consistently used, nomograms for brain temperatures have also been developed by Brinkmann et al.",
              "in 1976 and 1978 and by Henssge et al.",
              "in 1984.",
              "[9] Rigor Mortis Rigor mortis is the post-mortem stiffening of muscles caused by the depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the muscles, which is necessary for the breakdown of actin-myosin filaments in the muscle fibers.",
              "Actin and myosin are components of the muscle fiber and form a bond during contraction.",
              "The cessation of oxygen supply causes the stoppage of aerobic respiration in the cells and leads to a lack of ATP production.",
              "Rigor mortis starts immediately after death and is usually seen in a sequence known as the \"march of rigor\" and Nysten's Law.",
              "While rigor mortis develops simultaneously in all muscle tissue in the body, voluntary and involuntary, the size of the muscle determines the perceptibility of changes by the examiner.",
              "Smaller muscles over the face \u2013 around the eyes, around the mouth, etc.",
              "are the muscles where rigor mortis first appears, followed by rigor mortis of the muscles in the hands and upper limbs, and finally appears in the large muscles of the lower limbs.",
              "Rigor mortis appears approximately 2 hours after death in the muscles of the face, progresses to the limbs over the next few hours, completing between 6 to 8 hours after death.",
              "[10] Rigor mortis then stays for another 12 hours (till 24 hours after death) and then disappears.",
              "[11] In the last phase of rigor mortis, the actin-myosin complex that has formed starts disintegrating due to proteolysis, resulting in the dissolution of the stiffness.",
              "This process begins in all the cells at the same time.",
              "However, just like with the appearance, this change is perceptible first in the smaller muscles of the face, followed by muscles of the upper limbs, and finally, the large muscles in the lower limbs.",
              "Rigor mortis generally disappears 36 hours after death, followed by a phase known as secondary flaccidity.",
              "Livor Mortis The final change in the classical triad is livor mortis, which is the purplish-blue discoloration of the skin in the dependent parts of the body due to the collection of blood in skin vessels caused by gravitational pull.",
              "Hypostasis develops as spots of discoloration within half an hour to 2 hours.",
              "These spots then coalesce into larger patches, which combine to form a uniform discoloration of the body's dependant parts that have not been subject to pressure, which appears from 6 to 12 hours.",
              "The discoloration becomes 'fixed' after a certain period, owing to blood cells' disintegration and hemoglobin's seepage.",
              "This fixation is confirmed by applying pressure with thumbs and is traditionally used to denote a PMI greater than 12 hours.",
              "[12] This method of estimation of PMI required an objective and modern approach, leading to the development of colorimetric methods to estimate PMI from livor mortis.",
              "[13] Histo-morphological Analysis Other methods of estimating TSD in the early phase include histo-morphological and Bio-chemical analysis.",
              "Total and differential blood counts and the microscopic morphological examination of blood have been described as a method for estimation of the TSD.",
              "All blood cells were not identifiable beyond 84 hours after death.",
              "Similarly, blood cell counts were also found to decrease beyond 84 hours after death.",
              "[5] Histological studies of the skin have shown that degenerative changes appear in the skin 6 hours after death and first appear as vacuolating the corpus basale and spinosum.",
              "Dermo-epidermal separation is seen 9 hours after death, while the dermis showed rarefaction and disintegration 6 and 18 hours after death, respectively.",
              "The glycogen in the basal membrane of the sweat glands, the secretory cells cytoplasm, and duct cells gets depleted within 3 hours PMI and leads to PAS-negative cells on histology.",
              "The basal membrane, however, continues to show a magenta staining up to 18 hours post-mortem.",
              "The eccrine sweat glands show vacuolation after 3 to 4 hours of PMI, and cells appear to have completely disintegrated 15 hours after death.",
              "The sebaceous glands appear normal till 18 hours post-mortem, seen as separating the layers and disintegrating hair papilla.",
              "[4] Studies have also shown that pleocytosis can estimate the PMI using a polynomial equation of the third order.",
              "The cells are primarily lymphocytes with a significant fraction of macrophages, which become vacuolated and unidentifiable after 12 hours.",
              "[14] Biochemical Assessment Biochemical blood assessment is non-significant in the immediate post-mortem phase due to the lack of cellular death.",
              "On the other hand, cellular death makes biochemical blood assessment in the early phase extremely difficult.",
              "Also, there is the redistribution of electrolytes from the cells into the plasma and serum, resulting in varying changes in the levels of these electrolytes.",
              "These variations and their implications are studied in the emerging field of thanato-chemistry.",
              "The biochemical assessment has been useful for estimating PMI from vitreous humor, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.",
              "Numerous factors, however, need to be accounted for when examining the PMI based on biochemistry, including, but not limited to, age, gender, biological background, lifestyle, cause of death, and a whole range of other intrinsic and extrinsic factors.",
              "Only a few biochemical markers (out of 388) were found to have had sufficient investigation with these considerations \u2013 namely potassium, sodium, urea, as well as chloride, magnesium, hypoxanthine, and cardiac troponin T.",
              "Assessment for their potential for use was found to be alarming, with 0 (zero) biochemical markers being judged to have had suitable research and suitable for use.",
              "Six were found to be suitably researched but not suitable for practical use.",
              "Meanwhile, 18 were found to have been poorly investigated and not suitable for the application, and a further 364 biochemical markers did not have sufficient information.",
              "[15] Supra-vital Reactions Supra-vital reactions have also been proposed as a means of estimation of PMI.",
              "The determination of the supra-vitality period, therefore, can help assist in the estimation of PMI.",
              "For this method, Madea defines the PMI into four stages - the latency period, where despite stoppage of circulation, the tissue still performs aerobic respiration till the depletion of its stores \u2013 the survival period, where there is loss of tissue function, but they can be re-activated using external stimuli, e.",
              "g., electrical stimulation of nerves \u2013 the resuscitation period, where the ability of the tissue to recover is completely lost, \u2013 and the supra-vital period.",
              "Madea defines supra-vitality as the survival period of tissue after complete, irreversible ischemia.",
              "This concept states that the survival period encompasses the latency period.",
              "The resuscitation period encompasses both the latency and survival periods, and the supra-vitality period includes all the other three.",
              "Supra-vitality is also different from the resuscitation period in that the tissue is excitable irrespective of recovery of function.",
              "As an example, the resuscitation period of skeletal muscle is approximated to be 2 to 3 hours, but the supravital period in some cases, may extend to 20 hours.",
              "Similarly, cardiac muscles have a resuscitation period of 3.",
              "5 to 4 min, while the supravital period may extend up to 2 hours.",
              "[16] A method for estimating the PMI was developed using the electric excitability of Orbicularis oculi using surface electrodes.",
              "A ratio of relaxation time and maximum force, called force-related relaxation time, was reliable for estimating the PMI.",
              "It is also important to consider the super-sensitivity of tissue in the immediate post-mortem phase, called Zsako's phenomenon.",
              "Therefore, the supra-vital reaction examines the idio-muscular or local contraction and not the contraction of the entire muscle.",
              "[9] Late PMI The late post-mortem phase is when the body tissue starts disintegrating and is primarily describable as decomposition or putrefaction, adipocere formation, mummification, or skeletonization.",
              "Complex tissue in the body starts disintegrating into simpler molecular forms due to the breakdown of the tissue by the body's enzyme or bacteria and bacteria that colonize the remains after death.",
              "The body primarily undergoes decomposition or putrefaction, resulting in greenish discoloration, bloating due to gas formation, and liquefactive necrosis.",
              "The decomposition of remains is dependent on the climate, the season, body weight, and clothing.",
              "Decomposition can divide into five stages \u2013 fresh, early decomposition, advanced decomposition, skeletonization, and extreme decomposition.",
              "Fresh Phase The fresh phase can start as early as 24 hours and as late as 7 days after death, especially in colder winter months.",
              "This phase shows no insect activity other than the deposition of blowfly eggs in the cavities and areas of tissue dehiscence.",
              "Egg deposition has been documented in living patients, especially in immobile and debilitated subjects.",
              "[17] Early Decomposition Phase The early decomposition phase begins with the onset of skin slippage and hair loss.",
              "These changes usually begin from the first day after death to up to five days post-mortem.",
              "Maggots also begin to appear on the body, starting from the second-day post-mortem;",
              "the body appears grayish-green and marbling present (some parts of the body may still appear pinkish).",
              "The right iliac fossa is the first body part to show greenish discoloration and may be seen as early as the second-day post-mortem.",
              "This is due to the relatively superficial position of the caecum.",
              "The extremities appear brownish with the drying of the skin, especially over the fingers, nose, and ears, usually beginning on the second post-mortem day;",
              "the body appears greenish with distinct bloating.",
              "The greenish discoloration that started at the right iliac fossa progresses to encompass the entire abdomen, with concurrent bloating of the abdomen, which again may start on the second day.",
              "The bloating advances to the rest of the torso and, subsequently, the body, resulting in crepitations over the entire body on handling.",
              "This phase is also associated with purging \u2013 the release of decomposition fluid from the orifices \u2013 and a strong disagreeable odor.",
              "Bloating may be seen as early as three days after death and usually subsides by the second-week post-mortem due to disruption of the abdominal gases;",
              "The body appears blackish-green by the second week;",
              "and finally, the body appears brownish-black with a leathery appearance of skin.",
              "This stage is usually seen until the end of the first month but may be prolonged to as long as two months.",
              "The underlying tissue also appears darkened, with the texture changing to a viscous, slimy paste.",
              "Between the tenth day and the end of the first month, maggot activity continues under the leathery skin.",
              "The skin further desiccates to form a hardened leathery shell, with loss of underlying soft tissue.",
              "Advanced Decomposition Phase The advanced decomposition phase begins with the appearance of loose, sagging skin and the collapse of the abdominal cavity.",
              "The body also shows extensive maggot infestation.",
              "These changes usually appear on the fourth-day post-mortem but may begin as late as ten days after death.",
              "Loss of soft tissue, including the loss of the desiccated leathery skin, results in exposure of less than half of the skeletal material.",
              "This phase is usually associated with the presence of pupal cases, as well as the appearance of molds over the body and clothing;",
              "this usually occurs in the second month but may occur six to nine months post-mortem.",
              "Desiccation of the outer skin could accompany the structural retention of internal organs or be accompanied by autolysis and loss of internal organs.",
              "Decomposition may progress rapidly in buried remains or in remains left in an environment with high humidity, resulting in extreme maggot activity and accelerated autolysis, and could progress directly to skeletonization or adipocere formation without desiccation and mummification of the skin and outer tissue.",
              "[18] The remains may undergo either saponification or desiccation, called adipocere formation and mummification, respectively, depending on the environment and conditions present.",
              "The presence of a warm, humid environment that lacks oxygen favors the development of adipocere \u2013 a waxy substance that results from anaerobic bacterial hydrolysis of body fat.",
              "The primary organism responsible for adipocere formation is Clostridium perfringens, causing causes aggregation of crystals of fatty acid, resulting in loss of cellular detail and the loss of epidermis.",
              "[19] The formation of adipocere and the time duration depend primarily on the pH, temperature, moisture, and lack of oxygen in the environment.",
              "[20] Skeletonization Phase The skeletonization phase results in the exposure of more than half of the skeletal elements, which could still demonstrate soft tissue that is still attached.",
              "However, skeletonization is usually associated with desiccated tissue or adipocere over less than half of the body.",
              "The desiccated tissue most commonly appears at muscular or ligamental attachments along the vertebral column and ends of long bones.",
              "Meanwhile, adipocere is commonly seen over the thighs, having high subcutaneous fat deposits.",
              "This stage appears two months after the death, although it usually presents between two and nine months post-mortem.",
              "Continuation of decomposition leads to exposure of all osseous material, with only some greasy material left behind or exposing dry bones;",
              "this is usually seen after six months of exposure, although it has been reported to have occurred as early as the third week.",
              "This stage can last for years if the elements are not exposed, as is seen in buried remains or remains found indoors.",
              "Extreme Decomposition Phase The phase of extreme decomposition is seen only in remains that have been exposed to the environment and lead to erosion of the skeletal elements.",
              "This erosion begins with the process of bleaching of bones and is commonly seen six months after exposure, although it has been documented to appear as early as two months after death and as late as two and a half years post-mortem.",
              "The skeletal elements undergo further degeneration of the cortical structure, resulting in a metaphyseal loss in long bones and exposure of the cancellous part of spongy bones;",

              "A suitable succession model is chosen for use in a succession-based approach, one that corresponds to the environmental conditions, including the circumstances of death.",
              "Therefore, forensic research into the effect of environmental factors on decomposition and insect succession is needed.",

              "Availability of a tool-box of methods allows a case-specific selection of the most appropriate one(s), or eventually provides improvements in the overall accuracy and precision of the PMI estimation by merging and combining methods.",
              "To investigate practical (field) application, eventual interferences, and/or synergetic effects, as well as the robustness of these methods towards specific influencing factors, a field study was conducted, using eight pig cadavers of different body weights and physical coverage, left to decompose under natural conditions for 16 days.",

              "To estimate the time since death, or postmortem interval (PMI), as precisely as possible is a central, yet very complex aspect in forensic pathology [1].",
              "Most of the available methods to date, such as the comparison of body core and environmental temperature [2], analysis of rigor and livor mortis [3], or the assessment of supravital phenomena [4], are more or less restricted to specific circumstances of death, dependent on the stage of decay or limited to certain postmortem timeframes.",
              "However, in early-stages postmortem, a combination of these approaches allows a more reliable estimation of the PMI [5, 6].",
              "In later stages, the life cycle of necrophagous insects developing on the body [7], the analysis of tissue degradation [8,9,10], or morphological changes [11] of a dead body can contribute to exclude specific timeframes or provide minimum postmortem intervals (PMImin).",
              "However, these methods can only be applied under specific circumstances (mere presence of insects, or remaining tissue, no exclusion criteria such as myiasis [12, 13], or altered in vivo tissue metabolism [14], etc.)",
              "and only little is known about how the investigated phenomena influence each other.",
              "In fact, PMI estimation in forensic practice is often an exclusion process of available methods, which ultimately can lead to unsatisfactory outcome due to poor reliability and/or accuracy.",
              "This problem is most acute in the late PMI, when decomposition advances and most of the abovementioned methods are no longer useful.",
              "Human decomposition is a very complex process due to the interaction of different biological and chemical components [15].",
              "Up to date, a unique decomposition model cannot match all potential forensic cases because of highly variable decomposition processes taking place in response to the effect of extrinsic- or intrinsic-influencing factors.",
              "Extrinsic factors include environmental conditions (e.",
              "g., temperature, moisture, clothing, concealment, weather, and insect activity), while intrinsic factors are mostly related to the cause and manner of death and the characteristics of the human body (body mass, age, gender, injuries, or medical treatments) [15,16,17,18,19].",
              "Of these, temperature and humidity are considered among the most significant variables affecting the rate of decomposition [20].",
              "Currently, several methods are expected to assist in the estimation of the PMI in the advanced stages of decomposition such as forensic entomology [21], the skeletal muscle protein degradation [10], and the classification of decomposition morphology by the means of a total body score (TBS) [11].",
              "However, the reliability of these methods is also affected by several sources of inaccuracy, mostly related to biotic (bacteria, plants, scavengers) and abiotic (rainfall, ventilation, soil) factors.",
              "Moreover, they are validated to varying degrees.",
              "Temperature, environment, and access for insects are well known as the most important variables influencing degradation or preservation of soft tissues [21, 22].",
              "Hence, forensic entomology, e.",
              "g., although a well-established method of estimating the PMI via the age of the insects developing on the body, is only capable of providing a minimum PMI (PMImin) as insects do not always have immediate access to the corpse and might colonize it with delay.",
              "Succession of insect species occurring on cadavers can follow a regular pattern and as such be used as a manual for timeline data which, depending on the case, can additionally narrow down time period [23].",
              "However, application can be delicate, as some species depict a random occurrence pattern and do not necessarily follow the predicted succession [24].",
              "Moreover, community structure and arrival patterns as well as associated decomposition rates can as well alter the access for insects [25].",
              "The study of skeletal muscle protein decay is promising [10] and offers some advantages: its immediate use following death, the high abundance of muscle tissue in human bodies, and the ease of sampling.",
              "Although this method has already proven its potential in human application [26, 27], it requires additional validation, especially on behalf of possible influencing factors.",
              "Last but not the least, decomposition scoring systems are still of little help in forensic practice [28, 29].",
              "In fact, the regression equations developed from such decomposition scores seem to be useful only if applied to bodies exposed to exactly the same experimental conditions as to which they have been tested.",
              "In case work, there is often a certain time point of interest, such as if a person died before or after a specific date.",
              "In combination with the numerous variations of the circumstances of death, this requires a tool-box of methods to select the most appropriate ones for case-specific application.",
              "Some methods have to be excluded under certain circumstances, under which other approaches work just fine.",
              "Ultimately, merging and combining several methods can improve the overall accuracy of the estimation, just as used in the compound method for early-period PMI estimation [5, 6].",
              "Aiming to develop a similar concept for advanced decomposition, a pilot study was designed using eight pigs of varying body weights and different forms of physical coverage.",
              "The pigs were placed in a rural area and left to decompose under natural conditions: (i) morphological changes were classified and assessed using TBS, (ii) muscle samples were collected and their protein degradation analyzed, (iii) insect colonization was evaluated and their immature development recorded.",

              "This can partly be explained by sampling artifacts, within the respective studies (not enough time, etc.)",

              "e., the fact that there can be a delayed colonization, causes the entomological clock to start running one to several days later.",
              "Qualitative changes of protein band patterns such as occurring degradation products or the loss of native protein bands can be valuable clues for PMI estimation.",
              "However, to date, there is only limited reference data for humans [26] and available data regarding the porcine animal model exclusively originate from controlled laboratory studies [10].",
              "To provide further reference data, we tested the method in uncontrolled field conditions by comparing results of this animal study to already available reference data from controlled environments.",
              "To additionally improve the applicability of the method in field conditions, we were able to adapt sampling and sample processing for routine practice.",
              "Comparing degradation patterns of tropomyosin, this protein turned out to be very stable towards decomposition, as it has been shown previously for humans and pigs [10, 26].",
              "The significant loss of native cardiac troponin T (cTnT) after day 5, in comparison, partly contradicts previously described results in pigs, where this change occurred after 9 to 10 days postmortem at 21 \u00b0C under controlled laboratory conditions [10].",
              "The exact reason why no native bands of desmin were detectable remains unclear.",
              "This deviation from usually seen results can be due to adaptations of sample processing to enable efficient application of the method in field conditions.",
              "Instead of fixing the biopsy samples with liquid nitrogen, which should be the method of choice to immediately end autolytic processes and thus preserve the degradation status, a chemical preservation with RIPA buffer including protease inhibitor was used.",
              "Although this protocol obviously had no effect on the detection of other proteins, a negative reaction with native desmin cannot be excluded and remains to be further tested.",
              "As far as valid interpretation is possible, the absence of native desmin did not affect the occurrence of desmin degradation products.",
              "While desmin fragments were detected in all samples with increasing frequency from day 3 to day 5, similar degradation products have been reported after 1 to 2 days in pigs stored at 21 \u00b0C [10] and after a few hours in humans when ADD is back-calculated to PMI with 20 \u00b0C assumed [26].",
              "Divergences such as temporal deviations of absence or presence of certain bands can be partly explained by a lower mean temperature in the field experiment (just over 17 \u00b0C during the first 5 days).",
              "The much higher humidity (usually near saturation due to regular rainfalls vs. 35 \u00b1 5% relative humidity in lab experiments) in combination with the fact that in lab experiments explanted legs were used (drying is promoted by large areas without protecting skin) might also cause altered temporal degradation pattern as seen for cTnT.",
              "A further interference factor was represented by increased insect activity with a consequent excessive loss of tissue and thus unavailability to analyze proteins.",
              "Notably, all samples taken after day 5 (n = 4) depicted low protein concentrations and comparably weak bands in all proteins analyzed.",
              "In the case of cTnT, together with a high humidity, this could explain the earlier loss of native bands in comparison with previous lab experiments.",
              "In practice, the disappearance of native proteins and protein fragments depicts only a minor problem for statistical modeling or the application for PMI estimation, as it could only be applied for present degradation products.",
              "If no degradation products (e.",
              "g., of desmin) were detected in a certain case scenario, other proteins would have to be used to conclude a PMI (e.",
              "g., cTnT).",
              "The phenomenon of transiently occurring degradation products as it was found for desmin fragments in this study, however, has to be considered for fragments of other proteins as well, thus underling the importance of positive control proteins (such as tropomyosin).",
              "To our knowledge, this is the first experimental series analyzing vinculin degradation in pigs on a quantitative basis.",
              "Indeed, the present results show the potential of this protein for future application in PMI estimations.",
              "Especially, the loss of the meta-vinculin band, occurring at day 3 in all animals, confirms the results of previous pilot experiments on pigs and humans [53] and quantitative experiments on rats [54].",
              "Also, the loss of native vinculin and the appearance of degradation products have been reported [53, 54].",
              "However, in this particular study, these changes occurred in the later stages of the experimental series in which only a small sample size was available, thus producing large confidence intervals.",
              "Additional experiments are necessary to test the applicability for future practice.",
              "The results of this experiment depict the potential of muscle tissue (protein) degradation analysis for PMI estimation, particularly within the first 5 to 10 days.",
              "This is especially underlined by the finding that protein degradation was largely robust towards the individual influencing factors body weight and exposure.",
              "However, at the same time, differences to previous results show the importance to further investigate the effect of factors such as temperature and humidity in detail.",
              "This pilot field study partly met the objectives to compare the applicability of methods for PMI estimation in advanced decomposition stages.",
              "Strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of morphological scoring methods (TBS), tissue decomposition (skeletal muscle protein degradation), and forensic entomology were clearly revealed, underlining the current restrictions and future challenges in this field.",
              "Morphological methods and skeletal muscle protein degradation produced fairly consistent data within the first 5 days.",
              "Afterwards, morphological changes were found to be highly variable upon individual influences, even under the same environmental conditions.",
              "Protein analysis was largely robust to individual influences;",
              "however, it could no longer be applied in some of the carcasses after day 7 due to indirect environmental influences (promoting insect colonization and a resulting loss of tissue).",
              "When tissue was preserved, due to less insect activity, protein analysis provided valuable results even until day 14.",
              "On the contrary, from carcasses lacking tissue after a couple of days, a sufficient amount of fly specimens was available for forensic entomological analysis and the estimation of a minimum PMI (PMImin), demonstrating a valuable complementary effect of entomology and protein analysis.",
              "In this field study, forensic entomology could not provide evident data in the early postmortem period, but became increasingly important, and ultimately the last sufficiently applicable approach.",
              "Valuable PMImin estimations were obtained mainly by analysis of larval stages of blow flies.",
              "However, to date, no reliable reference data exists for some of the most abundant species in this study.",
              "In practical case work, a recommended approach might be to use data from closely related species.",
              "However, it has to be ensured that both the species (one from which the reference data derived and one for which calculations are be made) have similar geographic origins [55].",
              "A combination of the applied methods could not increase the overall accuracy of PMI estimations, but having various techniques available covered a significantly larger time period compared with an individual approach.",
              "Future studies on all three methods are required to (i) investigate (additional) influencing factors, (ii) increase reference data, and (iii) further investigate respective interactions in both, the animal model and humans, to be able to provide a sufficient tool-box for a broad application spectrum in forensic case work.",

              "Availability of a tool-box of methods allows a case-specific selection of the most appropriate one(s), or eventually provides improvements in the overall accuracy and precision of the PMI estimation by merging and combining methods.",
              "To investigate practical (field) application, eventual interferences, and/or synergetic effects, as well as the robustness of these methods towards specific influencing factors, a field study was conducted, using eight pig cadavers of different body weights and physical coverage, left to decompose under natural conditions for 16 days.",
              "Morphological changes during decomposition were assessed using the total body score (TBS), muscle samples were collected to analyze protein degradation, and insect colonization was evaluated.",

              "Avoid common mistakes on your manuscript.",
              "To estimate the time since death, or postmortem interval (PMI), as precisely as possible is a central, yet very complex aspect in forensic pathology [1].",
              "Most of the available methods to date, such as the comparison of body core and environmental temperature [2], analysis of rigor and livor mortis [3], or the assessment of supravital phenomena [4], are more or less restricted to specific circumstances of death, dependent on the stage of decay or limited to certain postmortem timeframes.",
              "However, in early-stages postmortem, a combination of these approaches allows a more reliable estimation of the PMI [5, 6].",
              "In later stages, the life cycle of necrophagous insects developing on the body [7], the analysis of tissue degradation [8,9,10], or morphological changes [11] of a dead body can contribute to exclude specific timeframes or provide minimum postmortem intervals (PMImin).",
              "However, these methods can only be applied under specific circumstances (mere presence of insects, or remaining tissue, no exclusion criteria such as myiasis [12, 13], or altered in vivo tissue metabolism [14], etc.)",
              "and only little is known about how the investigated phenomena influence each other.",
              "In fact, PMI estimation in forensic practice is often an exclusion process of available methods, which ultimately can lead to unsatisfactory outcome due to poor reliability and/or accuracy.",
              "This problem is most acute in the late PMI, when decomposition advances and most of the abovementioned methods are no longer useful.",
              "Human decomposition is a very complex process due to the interaction of different biological and chemical components [15].",
              "Up to date, a unique decomposition model cannot match all potential forensic cases because of highly variable decomposition processes taking place in response to the effect of extrinsic- or intrinsic-influencing factors.",
              "Extrinsic factors include environmental conditions (e.",
              "g., temperature, moisture, clothing, concealment, weather, and insect activity), while intrinsic factors are mostly related to the cause and manner of death and the characteristics of the human body (body mass, age, gender, injuries, or medical treatments) [15,16,17,18,19].",
              "Of these, temperature and humidity are considered among the most significant variables affecting the rate of decomposition [20].",
              "Currently, several methods are expected to assist in the estimation of the PMI in the advanced stages of decomposition such as forensic entomology [21], the skeletal muscle protein degradation [10], and the classification of decomposition morphology by the means of a total body score (TBS) [11].",
              "However, the reliability of these methods is also affected by several sources of inaccuracy, mostly related to biotic (bacteria, plants, scavengers) and abiotic (rainfall, ventilation, soil) factors.",
              "Moreover, they are validated to varying degrees.",
              "Temperature, environment, and access for insects are well known as the most important variables influencing degradation or preservation of soft tissues [21, 22].",
              "Hence, forensic entomology, e.",
              "g., although a well-established method of estimating the PMI via the age of the insects developing on the body, is only capable of providing a minimum PMI (PMImin) as insects do not always have immediate access to the corpse and might colonize it with delay.",
              "Succession of insect species occurring on cadavers can follow a regular pattern and as such be used as a manual for timeline data which, depending on the case, can additionally narrow down time period [23].",
              "However, application can be delicate, as some species depict a random occurrence pattern and do not necessarily follow the predicted succession [24].",
              "Moreover, community structure and arrival patterns as well as associated decomposition rates can as well alter the access for insects [25].",
              "The study of skeletal muscle protein decay is promising [10] and offers some advantages: its immediate use following death, the high abundance of muscle tissue in human bodies, and the ease of sampling.",
              "Although this method has already proven its potential in human application [26, 27], it requires additional validation, especially on behalf of possible influencing factors.",
              "Last but not the least, decomposition scoring systems are still of little help in forensic practice [28, 29].",
              "In fact, the regression equations developed from such decomposition scores seem to be useful only if applied to bodies exposed to exactly the same experimental conditions as to which they have been tested.",
              "In case work, there is often a certain time point of interest, such as if a person died before or after a specific date.",
              "In combination with the numerous variations of the circumstances of death, this requires a tool-box of methods to select the most appropriate ones for case-specific application.",
              "Some methods have to be excluded under certain circumstances, under which other approaches work just fine.",
              "Ultimately, merging and combining several methods can improve the overall accuracy of the estimation, just as used in the compound method for early-period PMI estimation [5, 6].",
              "Aiming to develop a similar concept for advanced decomposition, a pilot study was designed using eight pigs of varying body weights and different forms of physical coverage.",
              "The pigs were placed in a rural area and left to decompose under natural conditions: (i) morphological changes were classified and assessed using TBS, (ii) muscle samples were collected and their protein degradation analyzed, (iii) insect colonization was evaluated and their immature development recorded.",
              "Simultaneously, environmental conditions were monitored, so that changes could be evaluated in context to accumulated degree days (ADD) over the course of 16 days of decomposition.",

              "The other four pigs were placed in pairs in a forest area: two (30 and 26 kg) were placed without any direct coverage, but in the shade of large, sparse trees, approximately 400 m away from the forest glade of the first two pairs.",

              "Divergences such as temporal deviations of absence or presence of certain bands can be partly explained by a lower mean temperature in the field experiment (just over 17 \u00b0C during the first 5 days).",
              "The much higher humidity (usually near saturation due to regular rainfalls vs. 35 \u00b1 5% relative humidity in lab experiments) in combination with the fact that in lab experiments explanted legs were used (drying is promoted by large areas without protecting skin) might also cause altered temporal degradation pattern as seen for cTnT.",
              "A further interference factor was represented by increased insect activity with a consequent excessive loss of tissue and thus unavailability to analyze proteins.",
              "Notably, all samples taken after day 5 (n = 4) depicted low protein concentrations and comparably weak bands in all proteins analyzed.",
              "In the case of cTnT, together with a high humidity, this could explain the earlier loss of native bands in comparison with previous lab experiments.",

              "On the contrary, from carcasses lacking tissue after a couple of days, a sufficient amount of fly specimens was available for forensic entomological analysis and the estimation of a minimum PMI (PMImin), demonstrating a valuable complementary effect of entomology and protein analysis.",

              "In this review, we first provide the forensic context of body fluid and tissue identification which resides in activity-level evaluations, then we discuss methods to locate body fluids at the scene or in the laboratory, which is followed by the major marker methodologies to analyze them.",
              "One of these methods is mRNA profiling, and we take a retrospective look at casework details and verdicts for mRNA cases in the Netherlands.",
              "This leads us to a criminalistic view on targets that can be accommodated in assays and the interpretation of cell typing results for instance, in mixed stains, which needs a very different approach from the interpretation of DNA results.",
              "Lastly, we consider possible other marker types that have been suggested, and practical aspects when introducing cell typing into a forensic laboratory.",
              "Increasingly, cases come to court in which the presence of cellular material of a person is not disputed but the activity that caused the deposition is.",

              "Forensic scientists approach such questions by performing activity-level evaluations [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].",

              "cellular material matching the suspect on the handle of a knife supporting the proposition that the suspect carried out the stabbing).",
              "Under H2, this questioned cellular material on the evidentiary item may result from a number of scenarios: (1) the cellular material was deposited not during the offense but at an earlier or later time (the suspect did not stab but picked up the knife after the stabbing);",
              "(2) the cellular material was not deposited by direct contact but was the result of secondary (or tertiary or further) transfer (the suspect shook hands with the real perpetrator who then handled the knife in the stabbing);",
              "(3) the item on which the cellular material was deposited belongs to the suspect but was used in the offense by another person (the knife (owned by the suspect who uses it to cut food) was handled by the real perpetrator in the stabbing);",
              "(4) the cellular material was deposited on the knife in a different way (the victim fell into the knife).",

              "To address deposition during the offense or during an earlier or later encounter, inferring the time since deposition (TSD) may be helpful.",
              "For bloodstains, various spectroscopic and chemometric TSD methods have been proposed that rely foremost on changes to hemoglobin [9,10,11,12,13].",
              "An approach that would be applicable to more body fluids than blood is based on differences in the degradation over time of distinct RNA molecules outside the human body.",
              "Determining relative expression ratios may allow inference of TSD, although robustness is not yet at the level needed for forensic casework [14,15,16,17,18,19].",
              "Recently, microbes were explored for TSD purposes of saliva samples with some success, but the high inter-individual variation can surpass the time-dependent variation [20].",
              "To address the question of primary deposition or secondary transfer, TPPR (transfer, prevalence, persistence and recovery) issues are studied [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31].",
              "The aspect of transfer appears the most complex among TPPR issues and many studies have gained information on transfer rates, and the various aspects that influence transfer rates such as wet or dried state, application of friction and pressure, smooth or rough surface and size of the stain [32,33,34,35,36,37,38].",
              "Generally, probabilistic frameworks are used to guide the evaluation, and Bayesian networks are appreciated for their graphical strength in this evaluative process [39,40].",
              "Inferring the body fluid(s) present in stains is, in the context of secondary (or more) transfer, important for two reasons: (1) to assess the cellular content of the primary stain in relation to the DNA recovered from the evidentiary sample as some fluids have very high cellular content (for example nasal secretion), whilst others contain much fewer cells (for instance urine) and (2) to assess whether the body fluid involved is likely to occur in what is suggested) to be the primary location [41].",
              "For example, intimate body fluids (vaginal cellular material, menstrual secretion, semen) can be found in underpants of the wearer, but are less expected on hands or touched items [42,43,44].",
              "Saliva and nasal secretion, on the other hand, can reside on hands or items, and blood could occur when people have (small) wounds.",
              "Organ tissues (for instance, CNS (central nervous system), heart, or adipose tissue), on the other hand, are not expected on hands or on items. The scenario that another person and not the suspect utilized an item (belonging to the suspect) on which cellular material was deposited in the offense, can relate to objects (e.",
              "g., a knife used for stabbing or a bottle that was inserted vaginally) or clothing/ shoes that appear to have been worn during the offense for instance because blood spatter or organ tissue matching the victim found on them.",
              "Cell typing of samples from such items may provide the crucial link of the evidentiary item to the alleged crime (the knife carries muscle tissue matching the victim on the blade;",
              "the bottle contains vaginal material matching the victim on the bottle neck;",
              "the shoe carries CNS tissue matching the head-kicked victim), but the link to the perpetrator needs to be provided by other means.",

              "g., of the shoelaces or the insides of the neck and collar areas of the sweater) or CCTV-footage or witness reports on the suspect acting in the stabbing or wearing the shoes or clothing at the time of the attack.",
              "When a different way for the deposition of the cellular material is proposed (e.",
              "g., shooting out of self-defense, intercourse with consent), the evaluation is often at the offense level, which means the domain of the court [2,45,46].",
              "With such scenarios, DNA nor cell typing add value in most of the cases.",
              "Not only the type of body fluid or organ tissue, but also the location, pattern and amount of cellular material can be relevant for activity-level evaluations or contextualizing the scene.",
              "For example, trousers of a suspect may carry multiple bloodstains matching the DNA profile of a deceased person.",
              "Bloodstain pattern analysis may reveal a mist-like pattern and diluted bloodstains.",
              "RNA analysis of multiple stains could indicate the presence of blood, saliva, and nasal mucosa in various combinations.",
              "Together, the location, pattern, amount, and type of detected body fluids indicate expirated blood.",
              "Pathology may reveal injuries to the lungs or airways, which could have triggered the victim to expel blood mixed with air from the lungs through the nose or mouth.",
              "The combination of identified body fluids, location/ pattern and amounts would support the suspect being in the vicinity of the dying victim expelling blood and would provide less support for a scenario in which the suspect would visit the scene of the crime a day later.",
              "Locating and identifying body fluids and tissues is important for two main reasons: (1) to find traces related to the alleged crime which can then be collected and from which the identity of the perpetrator may be revealed by further testing;",
              "(2) to contextualize the traces as explained in Section 1.",
              "3 to provide information about what activities may have taken place.",
              "This can be done at the scene, where time is limited, using techniques that are mostly presumptive and visual in nature, or in a forensic laboratory (using samples and items collected at the scene) where more detailed analysis is possible.",
              "Here we describe technologies for locating latent biological evidence for use at the scene that can also be used in the laboratory.",
              "These include chemiluminescent sprays such as those based on luminol, safer and non-invasive alternative light sources and spectroscopic methods using handheld instruments.",
              "Handheld devices, and technologies that are non-destructive to the sample offer the greatest potential as these can be used to rapidly direct investigations and the collection of evidence.",
              "Sometimes blood at crime scenes is difficult to see, perhaps there is a very small quantity of diluted blood (cleaning may have taken place), the blood is on a surface that makes it difficult to find (like a dark substrate or upon repainting) or there is a trail of blood-stained shoeprints leading from the scene which are no longer visible.",
              "Luminol and the more user-friendly, luminol-derived Bluestar (Bluestar Forensic, Monaco) reagent [47], are often used to detect haemoglobin and its derivatives resulting in a blue fluorescence which is captured by photography [48].",
              "One disadvantage of such methods includes that the luminescence produced can be faint and short-lived, and in the case of luminol the visualization must be carried out in near darkness [48].",
              "Different formulations exist and those that maximise the brightness and longevity of the fluorescence and that have few adverse effects on subsequent tests for blood or on DNA profiling are preferred [48,49,50,51].",
              "A more recent development is the proposed use of a click reaction [52] between serum albumin and tetraphenylethene maleimide.",
              "The reaction is less harsh than that of luminol and BlueStar and produces a stable and sensitive response and shows promise for further development.",
              "To locate semen, alternative light sources (ALS;",
              "see Section 2.",
              "1.",

              "In 2017, STK Sperm TrackerTM was introduced to the market by AXO Science (Lyon, France) as a human semen-specific test [53].",
              "Sperm Tracker is available as a spray for crime scene use and in impregnated sheets for use on larger items. Detection requires a UV light source, that the room or space be darkened, and it must be used before luminol or BlueStar.",
              "ALS refers to the use of light of different wavelengths, including infrared, to detect forensic evidence in a non-destructive manner, and are often used to assist in the reconstruction of events.",
              "The detection of biological evidence is possible because they contain autofluorescent components which allow them to be visualized when illuminated at specific wavelengths.",
              "An early study comparing different laser and ultraviolet light sources for the detection of biological fluids [54] has been followed by the development of many commercially available light sources such as the Polilight\u00ae series (Rofin Australia Pty Ltd.",
              ", Melbourne, VIC, Austraila) and the LED-based Crime-lite\u00ae series (Foster and Freeman Ltd.",

              "In an examination of the utility of the Polilight\u00ae [55] stains of blood, semen and saliva, not visible to the eye, were able to be detected and Polilight\u00ae performed well when compared to other presumptive screening tests.",
              "As different body fluids and substrates fluoresce at different wavelengths, selecting the best combination of lightsource (wavelength) and filter used for detection is important.",
              "By comparing results obtained from five body fluids applied to 29 different materials, the Lumatec Superlight 410 (Lumatec GMBH, Deisenhofen, Germany) was used on fresh stains [56] and the same stains after two years [57] using different filters.",
              "Their findings show that for every combination of substrate, fluid, light source, and filter, except one, there was a specific combination that was best.",
              "In general though, stains could still be visualised two years later, using a light source between 415 nm and 460 nm in combination with a yellow or orange filter.",
              "To improve the utility of light sources and photography at crime scenes, a study was conducted [51] combining a blue Crime-lite XL light source in combination with a 360\u00b0 camera to capture semen and saliva stains on a number of different substrates.",
              "This study was carried out in a mock crime scene indoor setting using volunteers to examine the images and locate the stains.",
              "The colour of the substrate was found to have an effect on the ability to see the stains, however, in general, the combination of light source and camera was effective.",
              "A side by side comparison of the Crime-lite\u00ae 82S, Polilight\u00ae PL400 and Polilight\u00ae PL500 [58] was recently carried out, comparing the sensitivity and performance of each on dilutions of saliva and semen on different fabrics.",
              "The LED light source used in the Crime-lite\u00ae 82S provided better detection of dilutions of saliva and overall performed better as a screening tool.",
              "Recent developments include combined handheld, UV/Vis/IR multi-wavelength light sources and camera combined, with automatic filter selection all controlled from an integrated touch screen for example the Crime-lite AUTO.",

              "In the most recent example [60], the instrument is paired with a mobile phone and software containing the necessary tools to train a variety of statistical models to interpret test data based on machine learning.",
              "The best of these models could correctly identify blood in 94% of cases, albeit with a false positive rate of 14% for blood-like substances such as red wine, tomato sauce, and coffee.",

              "Changes in the Soret peak observed at 415 nm are used to detect aging of the sample.",
              "In a set of fingerprints, aged over a 30 day period, HSI enabled the identification of the blood as well as aging of the prints [65].",

              "Using blood samples and different substrates, spectra were generated [67] that were used to train different classifiers to detect aged bloodstains and most recently a \u201cblood detection dataset\u201d was produced [68] specifically to assist in the challenging task of algorithm development for this new technology.",
              "In the previous section, we described approaches for locating biological evidence at crime scenes, particularly latent evidence that may not be visible to the naked eye.",
              "These methods can also be employed in a forensic laboratory when transportable items are involved.",
              "In the remainder of this section, we discuss methods that are primarily laboratory-based for locating biological fluids.",
              "These chemical, immunological, and spectroscopic tests are often used to presumptively identify biological fluids before conducting further, more specific testing where necessary.",
              "With the exception of microscopic identification of spermatozoa, forensic scientists often rely on sensitive but non-specific chemical tests, based primarily on the activity of enzymes in the target body fluid.",

              "For reviews covering this area, see [69,70,71].",
              "To supplement these chemical tests, laboratories may use immunochromatographic assays, which include tests for saliva, semen, urine, blood and menstrual blood.",
              "Despite advantages of speed, cost and ease of use, these assays are not as suitable for crime scene deployment as they require an extract of a sample to be made and are not an integral part of the DNA profiling process.",

              "It is interesting to reflect, in a retrospective manner, on which forensic questions RNA typing assays are applied in actual forensic casework, and whether this corresponds to the questions that initially triggered the development of the assays.",

              "RNA was extracted in 452 cases and in 238 of these cases, RNA typing was performed (in the other 214 cases, RNA was extracted but RNA typing was not (yet) requested by police or prosecution).",
              "In 178 cases (75%) body fluid typing was performed and in 60 cases (25%) organ typing.",

              "All 27 cases were sexual assaults, of which 25 questioned the presence of vaginal cellular material (note that at the NFI presumptive tests are used to assess the presence of blood, saliva, and seminal fluid).",
              "The 26th case aimed to discern menstrual or peripheral blood in a vaginal sampling of an assaulted female and the 27th case questioned the presence of semen or seminal fluid on the genitals of an adolescent female (generally the presence of semen is not assessed through RNA typing but microscopic analysis and differential extraction is used).",
              "Thus, in the Netherlands, RNA body fluid typing is mostly applied in sexual assault cases to assess the presence of vaginal cellular material.",

              "The corresponding DNA profiles of 53 of these 56 samples were mixed male/female profiles, while three showed no male (amelogenin Y) DNA and a full female profile (samplings from paper tissue, condom, or finger).",
              "The male/female ratio at the amelogenin locus in these mixed samples varied from 0.",

              "In six cases, secondary transfer was suggested: Three times vaginal material was supposedly picked up from either an item carrying vaginal material, or from being nearby the victim\u2019s vagina or from an unspecified source and then transferred to the penis.",
              "Vaginal cells on fingers of the suspect were suggested to originate from the victim touching her vagina and then shaking hands with the suspect, or from an unspecified activity.",
              "Vaginal cells in male underpants were suggested to originate from assisting the victim during vomiting after which her cellular material was transferred to his penis and underpants after a toilet visit (RNA typing was performed much later so the alternative scenario focused on explaining the female DNA).",
              "For a case with the presence of vaginal cells on the outside of a condom, the alternative scenario was that the father masturbated using a condom and that the results of vaginal cells and DNA-match with the adolescent daughter should be ignored as the mother was not included in the comparison (note that the DNA-profile fully matched the daughter).",

              "the suspect was suggested to have visited the scene a day later when the victims had already died).",
              "Five times it was suggested that another person was involved (twice handling the knife, three times wearing the clothing that contained CNS material matching the victim).",

              "the victim started shooting first so it was self-defense;",
              "the victim fell of the stairs (for the case in which blood was found on a baseball bat);",
              "the injuries were self-inflicted and the large puddles of blood on the bed sheets were staged by using animal or menstrual blood (this was the second case analyzed by body fluid typing);",

              "1.",
              "These were: (1) \u2018time of deposition\u2019, (2) \u2018another person performed the crime\u2019 and (3) \u2018innocent explanation\u2019;",

              "This makes sense, as in these cases, generous amounts of cellular material matching the victim(s) were found for which it is more difficult to invoke secondary transfer.",
              "Basically, there are two main reasons to include markers for a body fluid or an organ tissue in a cell typing assay: (1) the cell type can be questioned in forensic cases and (2) the cell type can be informative to an alternative, innocent explanation.",
              "From the case descriptions in Section 4.",
              "1, it is evident that in sexual assault allegations, most often the presence of vaginal cellular material and menstrual secretions is questioned.",
              "Semen (spermatozoa and/or seminal fluid) can be involved as well, generally in three circumstances: (1) as questioned body fluid in a sample in which semen is expected to be the predominant body fluid such as in a ejaculation stain on the body or clothing of the victim or inside a condom;",
              "(2) as a questioned body fluid in a sample containing a surplus amount of other cellular material such as in a vaginal, oral or rectal sample taken from the victim;",
              "or (3) as a background body fluid in a penile swab or finger/nail dirt sample that is examined for the presence of, for example, vaginal cellular material.",
              "Under circumstance (1), semen will be the predominant cell type, and, in most cases, microscopic analysis will suffice to show presence of spermatozoa and generate a DNA profile for the semen donor.",
              "In circumstance (2), when a surplus amount of cellular material of the victim is present, differential extraction (DE), (in which a mild lysis to extract nucleic acids from non-spermatozoa cells, followed by a strong lysis to extract nucleic acids of the spermatozoa) is likely performed.",
              "Since the presence of semen is questioned, most often this DE method will suffice and produce a sperm fraction from which a DNA profile informative for the semen donor is derived.",
              "When confirmation of the presence of spermatozoa in the sperm fraction is needed, various methods can be applied such as microscopic analysis or MSRE analysis [154,155,210,211] on DNA extracted from the sperm fraction [212] This is different in circumstance (3), where semen may be present in such amounts that it masks the presence of other body fluids.",
              "Here, it would be useful to apply a DE method that not only extracts DNA but also RNA and analyze the non-sperm RNA fraction for cell types other than spermatozoa (note that seminal fluid RNA will end up in this non-sperm RNA fraction as well).",
              "However, DE is hard to combine with RNA extraction as RNases are active during the mild lysis step unless an ample amount of strong RNase inhibitors is used [104].",
              "Other body fluids of which the presence may be questioned, are saliva and peripheral blood.",
              "For blood, molecular analyses are mostly applied for discerning peripheral blood and menstrual secretion.",
              "Saliva may be assessed in allegations of licking, which means that often body locations are sampled (breasts, genitals, mouth), and mixed DNA profiles are expected.",
              "To assess allegations of anal penetration, the identification of a rectal mucosa marker was described recently [213].",
              "A rectal mucosa marker is to be preferred over markers for fecal matter as rectal mucosa provides a more direct link to invasive activities.",
              "Finding a marker specific for rectal mucosa is challenging since many body cavities and tubular organs in the human body are lined by mucous membranes (for instance, along the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tract), an epithelial tissue that secretes mucus.",
              "Thus, specificity of mucous membrane genes may be an issue, they may prove general mucosa markers or cross-react with some other body fluid derived from a mucous membrane [98,214].",
              "The second reason to include markers for a specific body fluid in a cell typing assay is to inform an alternative, innocent explanation for the findings.",
              "Nasal secretion has a high cellular content and may therefore leave detectable amounts after secondary transfer, which may be proposed as an alternative scenario (H1: vaginal penetration by penis;",
              "H2: victim sneezes in hand, shakes hand of the suspect, suspect touches his penis during toilet visit).",
              "Thus, nasal secretion markers have been identified and included in body fluid typing assays [104,215].",
              "In addition, the presence of nasal secretion and blood in a sample may indicate nosebleed blood, that can be a spontaneous occurrence not connected to a crime.",
              "Occasionally, nasal secretion may be among the questioned body fluid such as in case of expiration of blood (here saliva markers will also be informative) or when a nosebleed is caused in a fight.",
              "Other body fluids for which markers have been identified are urine and sweat [128,216,217,218].",
              "These two body fluids have a relatively low cellular amount and are likely of limited importance.",
              "Urine may contribute some cellular material in underpants;",
              "sweat can be deposited together with skin.",
              "Skin was one of the earlier cell types for which mRNA markers were identified [98,219,220,221,222], probably because contact traces are frequently submitted for forensic analyses.",
              "However, forensic practice in the Netherlands has shown that there is hardly any value in showing the presence of skin, as skin residues reside in almost all submitted samples.",
              "The presence of skin and DNA of a person of interest may be regarded mistakenly as an indication of direct contact, and due to the abundance of epithelial material in public and private items [42], secondary transfer is within the bound of possibility.",
              "For the assessment of cases of violence, various tissue types can be included.",
              "CNS tissue (brain and spinal cord) is highly important to include in the assays because of the often-lethal consequences.",
              "Other organs such as liver, heart, kidney, lung, trachea, intestine, stomach, spleen can be included for chest and abdominal injuries, but blood, muscular tissue and/or adipose are informative for injuries anywhere on a body [223,224,225].",
              "In a human body, there are ~210 cell types [226], and body fluids and organs contain several types of cells (semen may be an exception as semen carries besides spermatozoa only few other cell types).",
              "As evidentiary stains may be minute, not all cell types may be represented in a sample, so it can be opportune to include markers for various cell types from one tissue or fluid in an assay.",
              "For example, CNS tissue comprises two major tissues: grey matter and white matter.",
              "Grey matter (~10% of the tissue in the brain volume) consists mainly of neuronal cell bodies (and unmyelinated axons and glial cells), while white matter (the deeper layer) mainly contains myelinated axons (and astrocytes and oligodendrocytes that produce myelin) [227].",
              "Whether an evidentiary stain carries predominantly grey or white matter, will affect which markers can respond.",
              "With body fluids, samplings may have a more even distribution of cell types, due to the liquid constitution.",
              "These have different biological functions that affect their localization.",
              "For example, red blood cells function within the blood (amongst others for carriage of oxygen) while white blood cells act mostly outside of the bloodstream (immune system).",
              "As a consequence, white blood cells crawl into the lymphatic system by a process denoted extravasation [228]).",
              "The lymphatic system is an extensive drainage network and several other forensically relevant body fluids may thereby carry white blood cells (e.",
              "g., nasal secretion [228]).",
              "It is crucial to understand the biological function and performance on other body fluids or tissues for markers included in a cell typing assay.",
              "Generally, an evidentiary stain that is subjected for cell type analysis is also submitted for DNA profiling as one wishes to infer what cell type is donated by which person.",
              "This invokes a three-way interpretation: (1) the DNA profile;",
              "(2) the cell typing data and 3) the combination aiming to associate donor and cell type.",
              "The interpretation of DNA profiles has progressed tremendously through the application of probabilistic software [229,230,231,232,233] that use information on the number of contributors, allele frequencies, peak height, drop-in, dropout, degradation and more to provide a weight of evidence in the form of a likelihood ratio (LR).",
              "The LR includes a person of interest under H1 (H2 generally calculates the likelihood for an unknown, unrelated person).",
              "With the interpretation of cell typing data, several issues are to be considered: (1) limitations in sensitivity;",
              "(2) constraints for specificity;",
              "(3) degradation in evidentiary stains;",
              "(4) complications in case of a mixture of cell types and (5) providing an evidential value.",
              "These issues are discussed below, followed by developments on the association of donor and cell type.",
              "Ideally, a cell typing method has similar sensitivity for all cell types assessed in an assay, and a similar sensitivity as DNA profiling so that for all donors that give DNA information cell type information is derived as well.",
              "Over time, DNA profiling has become more and more sensitive and a full DNA profile can be generated from DNA amounts that equate to a few cells.",
              "The sensitivity of cell typing depends greatly on the type of marker that is used.",
              "DNA-based markers (those assessing methylation status) will at best be as sensitive as DNA profiling as both analyze features of the two genomic DNA copies.",
              "MSRE analysis [154,155,210,211] indeed approaches the sensitivity of DNA profiling, but methods that rely on a bisulfite conversion are much less sensitive as a large portion of DNA is lost during the conversion [146,147].",
              "RNA and protein/ enzyme markers are expressed and translated from DNA and may be several folds more abundant than DNA although expression levels can vary highly for different genes, and abundance is further influenced by stability/ turnover rates.",
              "Environmental and physiological factors may cause variation between people and over time (an infection will increase the number of white blood cells and the mRNAs these cells contain).",
              "Thus, it appears inevitable that the sensitivity of markers targeting either the same or different body fluids will vary [121] despite careful marker selection and assay optimization.",
              "An extreme example is semen from an azoospermic male, which will provide RNA and proteins for seminal fluid but little DNA (or spermatozoa mRNAs/ proteins).",
              "Thorough validation by which understanding of marker performance is obtained is of pivotal importance.",
              "Specificity issues can relate to human-specificity or tissue-specificity [234].",
              "Methods that analyze nucleic acids, can most often be designed to be human (or at least primate)-specific, which is less feasible for tests based on enzyme activity or antibodies.",
              "Processes such as readthrough or spurious transcription giving rise to non-specific background expression of mRNAs may result in signals above the detection threshold for the assay, especially when samples are over-amplified (by using too much input or too many amplification cycles).",
              "Technological imperfections can also cause non-specific signals like remnants of DNA in RNA assays (this is only an issue when it is not possible to design cDNA-specific amplicons with for instance one primer spanning an exon-exon boundary) or incomplete bisulfite conversion in methylation-based assays.",
              "The most difficult form of non-specificity is when markers cross-react with cell types other than the intended cell type.",
              "This occurs more with body fluids than with organs.",
              "For instance, saliva, nasal secretion and vaginal material are produced in body cavities (oral, nasal, vaginal) that are all lined with mucous membranes.",
              "These can, as previously mentioned, give rise to expression of the same mucous markers in these body fluids (denoted general mucosa markers [98]).",
              "These non-specific responses can show inter-individual variation: mRNA vaginal markers were detected in nasal secretions in many donors, with no relation to gender or having a cold [104].",
              "As with sensitivity, thorough validation with different donors is highly important to understand marker performance.",
              "Outside the human body, factors such as high humidity, UV radiation and/or high temperature can invoke degradation of nucleic acids, especially when stains have not fully dried.",
              "DNA is more resistant to hydrolysis than RNA, as the 2\u2019-OH group can attack the 3\u2019-phosphate, leading to hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond, which may lead to samples providing a DNA but no or hardly an RNA profile [97].",
              "Amplicons in RNA assays are therefore generally shorter (preferably under ~150 base pairs) than in DNA typing (up to ~450 base pairs).",
              "Intramolecular base pairing within RNA molecules (not only G:C and A:U but also G:U) may result in secondary and tertiary structures that provide more stability to certain regions, and amplicons targeting such stable RNA regions (StaRs) [95,235] may enhance RNA profiling.",
              "DNA methylation assays have the advantage of using the same nucleic acid as used for DNA profiling, so there is no difference in stability (the methylation marks remain stable also in body fluids deposited outside a human body [236]).",
              "RNA casework has shown that most evidentiary samples contain multiple fluids/ tissues, particularly with body fluid typing and less so with organ typing.",
              "One cause is that many samplings are taken from body locations (penis, fingers) or fabrics (clothing, bedding) that are likely to carry skin and other body fluid depositions.",
              "Moreover, the contributions may be highly unbalanced.",
              "To work on mixtures, markers should best respond in on-off modus meaning that a signal is obtained when the body fluid is present and not when a body fluid is absent.",
              "This can be achieved with RNA-based assays when markers are selected that show a large difference in expression between target and non-target tissues.",
              "Over-amplification needs to be avoided and detection thresholds need to be set.",
              "For methylation-based assays, application to mixtures depends on the technology that is chosen.",
              "With MSRE, CpG targets are selected that are only methylated in the target tissue (this does not need to be a 100% methylation).",
              "PCR product can only be generated when the restriction enzyme is unable to cut the DNA due to methylation of the restriction site [237].",
              "When methylation levels are assessed quantitively, for instance by sequencing bisulfite-converted DNA, it is highly complex to set interpretation guidelines for mixed samples.",
              "For example, when a chosen marker shows on average a 50% methylation rate in vaginal mucosa and 10% in other cell types, a 20% methylation level for the marker in an evidentiary sample can occur in different ways: (1) no vaginal mucosa is present and the methylation level of the other cell types (skin and/or semen) turns out higher than the average of 10%;",
              "(2) vaginal mucosa is present and no other cell types and the 20% methylation rate is an outlier for vaginal mucosa;",
              "(3) vaginal mucosa is mixed with other cell types for which a ratio of 1:3 would nicely explain the methylation rate of 20%.",
              "In this example, the DNA profile may be informative as a female donor will correspond to vaginal mucosa and the male donor to semen (if detected), but assumptions may need to made, for example, that no saliva from either one of the donors is present.",
              "When choosing a methodology for casework application, its suitability for mixed samples needs to be considered to enable appropriate interpretation.",
              "In expert reports, cell typing results are generally given as \u2018indication for the presence of\u2019 when genetic markers or tests for a body fluid or organ tissue are observed.",
              "With RNA typing, interpretation thresholds are applied as both drop-in and dropout may occur, due to limitations in sensitivity and specificity described above.",
              "These interpretation thresholds can include a numerical scoring [238], or a strategy of using replicates and a 50% rule in which at least half of the markers over all replicates need to be detected [111].",
              "All have the drawback that they represent a \u2018fall-of-the-cliff\u2019 method, which means that the detection of one marker more or less may change the interpretation of the results.",
              "Nowadays, the general trend in forensic reporting is to provide an evidential value, for example by presenting a likelihood ratio;",
              "the probability of the evidence given two competing hypotheses, H1 and H2.",
              "Formulating H1 can be straightforward (\u2018the sample contains vaginal cellular material\u2019);",
              "formulating H2 is more complex as it could be \u2018the sample does not contain vaginal cellular material\u2019 or \u2018the sample contains another body fluid\u2019.",
              "These hypotheses follow the simplifying assumption of one body fluid per sample.",
              "More realistic hypotheses consider mixtures and could be formulated as H1: \u2018the sample contains vaginal cellular material, and possibly other body fluids\u2019 and H2: \u2018the sample does not contain vaginal cellular material, but other body fluids\u2019 (note that one could also specify these other body fluids).",
              "Conditioning on cellular material assumed to be present (for instance, because the sample is a penile swab) would generate hypotheses like H1: \u2018the sample contains vaginal cellular material, and penile skin and possibly other body fluids\u2019 and H2: \u2018the sample does not contain vaginal cellular material, but penile skin and possibly other body fluids\u2019.",
              "Some statistical approaches have been proposed for body fluid typing;",
              "for organ typing, a multivariate statistical model was trained [120,239,240,241,242].",
              "The basis of such models is an experimental dataset consisting of ground truth data, that should be casework representative.",
              "This is challenging as casework includes a wide range of samples for which the true composition is not known.",
              "It is not trivial to prepare such a dataset, and the LR should be calibrated to suit the size of the dataset (note that for DNA datasets the allele frequencies are used, while with RNA datasets an RNA profile is considered in its entirety).",
              "Reporting the LR in a verbal scale rather than a numerical value, seems more appropriate.",
              "Clearly, further development is needed, although the developments are promising.",
              "A challenge for any forensic RNA typing method is the association of donor and body fluid.",
              "Complications are that one body fluid can be given by multiple donors and/or one donor can give multiple body fluids.",
              "Even with simple mixtures of two donors each giving one body fluid, it was shown that peak heights in DNA and RNA profiles cannot be used straightforwardly [97].",
              "Only with gender-specific body fluids (vaginal cellular material and semen) and the involvement (or assumption) of one donor of that gender, is association of donor and body fluid possible.",
              "This introduces the risk of an association fallacy [2,243].",
              "Thus, alternative procedures are being developed like SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in transcribed regions (RNA-SNPs) [242,244,245,246].",
              "The concept is that the RNA indicates which cell type is present and that, as the RNA is transcribed from DNA, the genetic variation within this transcribed region provides information on the identity of the donor.",
              "First, which cell types are present is assessed, then the genotype for the RNA-SNPs of the donors that are assumed to be present are derived by genotyping their reference DNA (since this is DNA, there is no need to provide the body fluid questioned) and lastly the RNA of the stain is sequenced to see what SNPs are present in the transcribed mRNA to see if/ who of the donors matches this sequence.",
              "This is a developing area with multiple challenges at hand: (1) SNPs can affect the stability or transcription level of RNAs, so the genotypes at the DNA and RNA level may not align (for instance one appears heterozygous at the DNA level but since the presence of a SNP affects RNA stability or expression level, one appears homozygous at the RNA level;",
              "(2) linked SNPs should be regarded according to their genetic phase (equivalent to a microhaplotype), which may be complicated when different SNPs reside in different amplicons;",
              "(3) the approach is only to be explored for samples in which all donors can be assumed as there is no clear strategy/consensus yet on how to deal with unknown donors.",
              "It is probably best to limit the approach initially to two-person mixtures.",

              "Methods not depending on bisulfite conversion (such as MSRE) may be most practical to use to detect these as the bisulfite conversion will affect all non-methylated cytosines complicating SNP detection and primer design.",

              "miRNAs are a class of small RNA molecules, 18\u201325 nucleotides in length, which are involved in the regulation (repression) of mRNA translation and stability [69,71].",

              "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA transcripts not translated into proteins that appear to be involved in the regulation of gene expression.",
              "Approximately 78% of them are tissue-based compared to approximately 18% of mRNA transcripts.",
              "One of the best studied is the X-inactive-based transcript (XIST) involved in X-chromosome inactivation [270,271].",
              "To date, XIST has been incorporated into an assay [272] to positively identify male and female cell material in forensic samples with a second study [273] further testing the assay on forensic type samples.",
              "All body fluids and tissues contain unique proteomes, derived from the expression of mRNAs (see Section 3.",
              "1.",
              "1) in turn derived from the genome.",
              "In the past, unique proteins of each body fluid or tissue type have been detected and presumptively identified by determination of the enzyme activity (acid phosphatase for example) or immunological properties (RSID tests (Independent Forensics, Lombard, IL, USA) for example).",
              "More recently technological developments in proteomics, as for genomics, have highlighted potential benefits for forensic identification purposes and useful reviews of the forensic potential have been published [274,275,276].",
              "Mass spectrometry (MS) is the analytical method of choice with advantages including high sensitivity and specificity [277].",
              "Generally, candidate markers are found by de novo analysis or from reference proteomes, then validated by testing on known samples.",
              "By detecting multiple peptides in a single assay from more than one protein per fluid, the assay can be considered not only confirmatory but also human-based and suitable for mixtures.",
              "Sensitive and specific assays have been developed including blood, semen, seminal fluid, saliva, vaginal/ menstrual fluid and urine [277,278,279,280] using methods such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS [277], quadrupole time-of-flight MS [278,279] MALDI MS Profiling and Imaging [281] and MALDI time-of-flight MS [282] from samples as diverse as blood-stained finger marks [281] and blood and vaginal cellular material under fingernails [282], although difficulties in identifying urine recovered from substrates and semen samples that had been mixed with lubricants were found [280].",
              "A challenge to be addressed is that the protein content of each fluid/ tissue varies considerably, and whilst it is possible to detect very small amounts of blood in saliva, the opposite was not true [277,278,279].",
              "MS methods tend to be destructive to the sample, however in a recent report [283] a new approach, sheath-flow probe electrospray ionisation MS was used, which allows stains to be sampled with no preparation or sample destruction bar the initial small amount taken.",
              "In the research which examined blood, saliva and urine, alterations were observed in the spectra over time suggesting that this approach could also be used to age a stain.",
              "The relationship between the proteome and the genome offers the possibility for proteomic \u201cgenotyping\u201d [284,285] in a similar manner to the suggested RNA SNP and CpG SNP approaches described in Section 6.",
              "4.",
              "This has clear advantages when DNA in a sample is compromised in quality and quantity such as in a hair shaft, as proteins are more stable and resistant to damage and decay than DNA.",
              "Genetic variations in human DNA can be linked to mutations found in hair proteins (genetically variant peptides (GVPs) referred to as single amino acid polymorphisms, SAPs, which in turn can be associated with their DNA counterparts (missense SNPs).",
              "GVPs containing SAPs can be identified by mapping these peptide sequences using MS and results have been obtained from short lengths of human hair [275,286].",
              "Not only could this approach be used to \u201cidentify\u201d and link individuals, but it can also be used to infer ancestry as SNP profiles varied between ancestral groups.",
              "Aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides or peptides that are selected using SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) in a sequential process to bind their target molecules in a highly specific and sensitive manner.",
              "Initial studies used RNA aptamers [287,288], with the first description of a DNA aptamer in 1992 [289] and the first XNA aptamer capable of binding to a small molecule (ochratoxin A) in 2018 [290].",
              "Aptamers have a number of advantages over assays such as the immunochromatogenic-based methods described in Section 2.",
              "2.",
              "1.",
              "Consistent aptamer synthesis methods, more straightforward functionalization, equivalent binding affinities and cheaper long term and stable production are all factors.",
              "Aptamers are now widely used as biosensors in a large number of fields [291,292] with significant and recent examples seen for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 [293,294] and have potential for the use in forensic science [295].",
              "Aptamers have been developed to detect PSA [296], hemoglobin [297] and more recently, aptamers to detect spermatozoa have been described using a combination of Cell-SELEX and massively parallel sequencing technologies [295].",
              "Once suitably specific and sensitive aptamers are obtained, they can be built into a range of sensors for detection many of them suitable for field deployment.",
              "Preferably, body fluid typing and DNA profiling (to answer the what and the who question) are analyzed on the exact same sample.",
              "This can be achieved when the DNA extract is used for cell type inference (as with methylation analysis) or when RNA is extracted from a fraction normally discarded during DNA extraction (like a flow through fraction when binding DNA to a silica column).",
              "Case reports have been published for both methylation [298] and RNA-based assays [299].",
              "The advantage of using DNA for body fluid typing is that no additional extraction procedure is needed;",
              "the disadvantage is that less DNA remains for further analyses such as Y-STR profiling, mtDNA analysis or the prediction of age, ancestry, appearance.",
              "Microbiome analysis can use either DNA or RNA.",
              "The global COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated the development of assays that may find their use in forensic analysis such as multiplexed and extraction-free amplification assays [300], which may provide RNA-based tests prior to DNA extraction and analysis that may present the opportunity of triage.",
              "Such extraction-free methods [301] present pioneering opportunities beyond advancements such as one-step RT-PCR methods that simplify current methodology [302].",
              "Introducing cell typing methodologies in a forensic laboratory requires extensive validation, implementation of interpretation and reporting, and explaining results for judiciary.",
              "This comes with additional costs (also because the technique itself may ask quite some hands-on laboratory work) and it has been suggested that it is best performed or outsourced to specialized laboratories.",
