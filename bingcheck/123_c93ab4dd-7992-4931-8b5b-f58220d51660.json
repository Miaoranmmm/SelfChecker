Flow was discovered and coined by the Hungarian-American psychologist Mih\u00e1ly Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi[^1^] [^3^], who studied the creative process and found that artists would persist at their task relentlessly, regardless of hunger or fatigue, when they were in a flow state[^3^].\n\nFlow has many benefits for well-being, happiness, emotional regulation, intrinsic motivation, and fulfillment[^2^] [^3^]. It also enhances performance and productivity in various domains, such as sports, art, work, education, and more[^3^] [^4^]. Flow can be achieved by finding activities that match the following criteria[^3^]:\n\n- Clear goals at every step\n- Immediate feedback on one's actions\n- A balance between challenges and skills\n- No agony over failure\n- A disappearance of self-consciousness and distractions\n- A sense of timelessness or distorted time\n- The process is what's enjoyable, not the result\n\nSome examples of activities that can induce flow are skiing, tennis, soccer, dancing, running, painting, drawing, writing, yoga, welding, chopping wood, etc. However, any activity could work as long as it meets the criteria above and pushes one out of their comfort zone[^3^].

              "Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, considered one of the co-founders of positive psychology, was the first to identify and research flow.",

              "The experience of flow is universal and has been reported to occur across all classes, genders, ages, and cultures, and it can be experienced during many types of activities.",
              "If you\u2019ve ever heard someone describe a time when their performance excelled and they were \u201cin the zone,\u201d they were likely describing an experience of flow.",
              "Flow occurs when your skill level and the challenge at hand are equal.",

              "Csikszentmihalyi became a happiness researcher because of the adversity he faced growing up.",
              "He was a prisoner during World War II, and he witnessed the pain and suffering of the people around him during this time.",
              "As a result, he developed a curiosity about happiness and contentment.",
              "Csikszentmihalyi observed that many people were unable to live a life of contentment after their jobs, homes, and security were lost during the war.",
              "After the war, he took an interest in art, philosophy, and religion as a way to answer the question, What creates a life worth living?",
              "Eventually, he stumbled upon psychology while at a ski resort in Switzerland.",
              "He attended a lecture by Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, who spoke of the traumatized psyches of the European people after World War II.",
              "Csikszentmihalyi was so intrigued that he started to read Jung\u2019s work, which in turn led him to the United States to pursue an education in psychology.",
              "He wanted to study the causes of happiness.",
              "Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s studies led him to conclude that happiness is an internal state of being, not an external one.",
              "His popular 1990 book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience is based on the premise that happiness levels can be shifted by introducing flow.",
              "Happiness is not a rigid, unchanging state, Csikszentmihalyi has argued.",
              "On the contrary, the manifestation of happiness takes a committed effort.",
              "Beyond each person\u2019s set point of happiness, there is a level of happiness over which each individual has some degree of control.",
              "Through research, Csikszentmihalyi began to understand that people were their most creative, productive, and happy when they are in a state of flow.",
              "Csikszentmihalyi interviewed athletes, musicians, and artists because he wanted to know when they experienced optimal performance levels.",
              "He was also interested in finding out how they felt during these experiences.",
              "Csikszentmihalyi developed the term \u201cflow state\u201d because many of the people he interviewed described their optimal states of performance as instances when their work simply flowed out of them without much effort.",
              "He aimed to discover what piques creativity, especially in the workplace, and how creativity can lead to productivity.",
              "He determined that flow is not only essential to a productive employee, but it is imperative for a contented one as well.",
              "In Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s words, flow is \u201ca state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter;",
              "the experience is so enjoyable that people will continue to do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it\u201d (1990).",
              "Here\u2019s a short video with a great explanation of flow: Have you ever experienced flow?",

              "Interestingly, the capacity to experience flow can differ from person to person.",
              "Studies suggest that those with autotelic personalities tend to experience more flow.",
              "Such people tend to do things for their own sake rather than chasing some distant external goal.",
              "This type of personality is distinguished by certain meta-skills such as high interest in life, persistence, and low self-centeredness.",
              "In a recent study investigating associations between flow and the five personality traits, researchers found a negative correlation between flow and neuroticism and a positive correlation between flow and conscientiousness (Ulle\u0301n et al.",
              ", 2012).",
              "It can be speculated that neurotic individuals are more prone to anxiety and self-criticism, which are conditions that can disrupt a flow state.",
              "In contrast, conscientious individuals are more likely to spend time mastering challenging tasks\u2013an important piece of the flow experience, especially in the workplace.",
              "The state of flow has rarely been investigated from a neuropsychological perspective, but it\u2019s becoming a focus of some researchers.",
              "According to Arne Dietrich, it has been associated with decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex (2003).",
              "The prefrontal cortex is an area of the brain responsible for higher cognitive functions such as self-reflective consciousness, memory, temporal integration, and working memory.",
              "It\u2019s an area that\u2019s responsible for our conscious and explicit state of mind.",
              "However, in a state of flow, this area is believed to temporarily down-regulate in a process called transient hypofrontality.",
              "This temporary inactivation of the prefrontal area may trigger the feelings of distortion of time, loss of self-consciousness, and loss of inner critic.",
              "Moreover, the inhibition of the prefrontal lobe may enable the implicit mind to take over, allowing more brain areas to communicate freely and engage in a creative process (Dietrich, 2004).",
              "In other research, it\u2019s been hypothesized that the flow state is related to the brain\u2019s dopamine reward circuitry since curiosity is highly amplified during flow (Gruber, Gelman, & Ranganath, 2014).",
              "It\u2019s important to note that one can\u2019t experience flow if distractions disrupt the experience (Nakamura et al.",
              ", 2009).",
              "Thus, to experience this state, one has to stay away from the attention-robbers common in a modern fast-paced life.",
              "A first step would be to turn off your smartphone when seeking flow.",
              "Also, the balance of perceived challenges and skills are important factors in flow (Nakamura et al.",
              ", 2009).",
              "On the one hand, when a challenge is bigger than one\u2019s level of skills, one becomes anxious and stressed.",
              "On the other hand, when the level of skill exceeds the size of the challenge, one becomes bored and distracted.",
              "Since the experience of this state is just in the middle, the balance is essential.",
              "\u201cInducing flow is about the balance between the level of skill and the size of the challenge at hand\u201d (Nakamura et al.",
              ", 2009).",
              "The experience of flow in everyday life is an important component of creativity and wellbeing.",
              "Indeed, it can be described as a key aspect of eudaimonia, or self-actualization, in an individual.",
              "Since it is intrinsically rewarding, the more you practice it, the more you seek to replicate these experiences, which help lead to a fully engaged and happy life.",
              "In one study, researchers from St.",
              "Bonaventure University asked students to participate in activities that would induce flow either in a team or by themselves (Walker, 2008).",
              "Students rated flow to be more enjoyable when in a team rather than when they were alone.",
              "Students also found it more joyful if the team members were able to talk to one another.",
              "This finding was replicated even when skill level and challenge were equal (Walker, 2008).",
              "A final study found that being in an interdependent group while experiencing flow is more enjoyable than one that is not (Walker, 2008).",
              "So, if you want to get more enjoyment out of flow, try engaging in activities together.",
              "This echoes psychologist Christopher Peterson\u2019s conclusion that positive psychology can be summed up in three words: \u201cOther people matter.",
              "\u201d Most conscious actions require motivation, and there are two basic motivation types: intrinsic and extrinsic.",
              "Intrinsic motivation is when you do something because you love it.",
              "Csikszentmihalyi said the highest intrinsic motivation is a flow state where self-consciousness is lost, one surrenders completely to the moment, and time means nothing (2013).",
              "Think of a competent musician playing without thinking, or a surfer catching a great wave and riding it with joy.",
              "Extrinsic motivation is when your motivation to succeed is controlled externally.",
              "That includes doing something to avoid getting into trouble or working hard to earn more money.",
              "That type of motivation is short-lived.",
              "A good kind of extrinsic motivation is when you are practicing to get better but you still need a tutor or teacher to validate your efforts.",
              "Flow theory interested Jacob Getzels and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi when they studied the creative process during the \u201960s (Getzels & Csikszentmihalyi, 1976).",
              "Watching an artist at work, Csikszentmihalyi became intrigued by their single-minded, unique focus and persistence to continue with the painting, despite discomfort, fatigue, or hunger.",
              "On finishing the painting, however, the artist ceased showing any interest in the completed work.",
              "Csikszentmihalyi (1975) then took his research into other fields, looking at the circumstances and subjective nature of this enjoyment-related phenomenon in dancers and chess players, to name a few.",
              "It was suggested that an optimal flow state was created when people tackled challenges that they perceived to be at just the right level of \u2018stretch\u2019 for their skill sets.",
              "In other words, neither too tough to elicit anxiety nor too easy to be boring.",
              "As shown in the graph, flow is experienced when one\u2019s skill level and the difficulty of the challenge at hand loosely match.",
              "For instance, those with greater skills are likely to experience flow on a task of greater difficulty than those with poorer skills.",
              "This \u201cmatch\u201d is what inspires flow.",
              "Psychologists Koehn et al.",
              "(2013) conducted research into different performance contexts and the production of the flow state, looking specifically at the way imagery and confidence levels interact to create flow.",

              "Measuring the performance of a tennis groundstroke, the researchers found a significant interaction between imagery and confidence (Koehn et al.",

              "According to Csikszentmihalyi [7] flow theory, the flow experience relates to the skill set perceived to be possessed by the individual relative to the perceived challenges of the activity.",
              "Challenges can be considered as \u201copportunities for action\u201d thus flow is produced by any situation that requires skill [3].",
              "The phenomenology of flow further suggests that the enjoyment of a task is due to a discovery found within the interaction of the task.",
              "For instance, at first the task might appear boring or anxiety provoking but if the action opportunities become clearer or the skill level improves the task becomes more engaging and finally enjoyable.",
              "The discovery of more complex behaviors results in an emergent motivation that transforms a previously unengaging task into that which is intrinsically motivating [8].",
              "Therefore, complexity of the skill must increase to meet the increasing complexity of the task\u2019s challenge in order for the person to remain in flow.",
              "Csikszentmihalyi [7] developed the flow state model to help illustrate this state change as seen in Figure 1.",
              "For instance, when the challenges and skills are low, a person will likely experience apathy, considered an experience of the lowest quality and the lowest intensity on the flow state model.",
              "Whereas, when the skills are greater than those needed for the challenges, the person is more likely to experience boredom/ relaxation, considered an experience of higher quality than apathy.",
              "As the level of challenge increases, the experience moves toward control.",
              "In contrast to this, when challenges are greater than the skills required by the person, the experience of worry/ anxiety is more likely.",
              "Then as the skill level increases, the experience moves toward arousal.",
              "Therefore, based on this model, flow states are believed to be accessed when skills and challenges are both high and in equilibrium, resulting in an experience of the highest quality [9].",
              "Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s flow model [7] describes psychological states in terms of challenge level and skill level.",
              "Nonetheless, flow rarely occurs in everyday life because challenges and skills are rarely balanced, but even these two parameters do not guarantee flow.",
              "Therefore, flow requires activities to have a further set of particular criteria [9].",
              "Firstly, the activity typically requires learning of skills, and have clear goals with quick and unambiguous feedback.",
              "This affords a sense of control over reality by understanding what needs to be done and how they are performing.",
              "This activity design also works best when concentration and involvement is facilitated by separating a person from their everyday existence by focusing on the particular reality of the activity, such as particular uniforms and special rules of the activity that are not necessarily relevant to everyday living [9].",
              "People in flow mention that they become so absorbed in the activity that they do not have any attention to spare to become distracted by anything else.",
              "People have also mentioned a collection of other psychological phenomena associated with states.",
              "These include: (a) a feeling of control over the activity;",
              "(b) an experience of time distortion, in which a person loses awareness of how time is passing (c) the removal of self-consciousness in which a person loses the awareness of themselves as well as thoughts of everyday problems;",

              "Therefore, when a person has a perceived adequacy of skills matched with above average challenges, as part of a goal-directed, rule bound system that provides clear feedback, the person can find complete absorption that removes the possibility of any distractions from thoughts irrelevant to the task at hand.",
              "In this focused space a person has an opportunity to find such a level of immersion in the activity that they will feel an inspired sense of control, a complete removal of self-consciousness, a distortion of time and a feeling of transcendence.",

              "It is the subjective challenges and skills, not the objective ones, that impact on the quality of a someone\u2019s experience [8].",
              "Numerous studies have further highlighted the similar subjective experience of flow states in various activities, such as sport [11], gambling [12], skateboarding [13], education [14] to name a few.",
              "No matter what the activity, the elicitation of this flow state is considered by many to be the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of performance [15].",
              "Even when one has satisfied the conditions stipulated as necessary to reach the flow state, this however still does not conclusively answer how certain people are able to reach this state nor why and whether all people are able to attain such a state [16].",
              "One element noted by Csikszentmihalyi that influences entrance into flow states is the level demanded by the critical implications of the activity [9].",
              "This has been shown to ascribe to a normative continuum to the flow experience based on the task\u2019s personal importance.",
              "For example, surgery and mountain climbing are highly critical tasks, which are more often reported to result in intense, ecstatic flow experiences whereas absorbing yet less critical tasks such as reading, and video games have less intense flow experiences.",
              "Additionally, flow states have been shown to be moderated by the level of perceived importance a person places on a task.",
              "A study by Engeser and Rheinberg [17] showed that importance impacts the skill/ challenge requirements.",
              "During activities considered important such as exams, flow was high when the challenge was low while activities considered less important such as playing Pac-Man, flow was highest when there was a skills/ challenge balance but low when the challenge was too low or high.",
              "Additionally, this study showed the importance of achievement motives, based on the risk taking models of Atkinson [18], who showed how the explicit motive of fear of failure and the implicit motive of hope for success influenced the preference towards a balance of challenge and skill.",
              "In particular, people with the hope for success are more likely to experience flow during balanced skills/ challenge task compared to individuals high in fear of failure who experience less flow when balanced.",
              "In considering these additional implications of criticality, importance and achievement motives, these lead to the introduction of environmental aspects such as the role of the task.",
              "For instance, how do these elements apply to work compared to recreational task?",
              "A study by Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre [19] showed surprisingly that flow was three times more likely to occur during work than recreation.",
              "However, even within work it depends on the role.",
              "For instance, managers reported the highest levels of flow in work while general workers reported the highest level in recreational flow.",
              "Furthermore, a recent study by Viljoen [20] of part time and professional musicians on the experience of flow looked at these elements to show the differences in their approach to the task.",
              "Occupational musicians showed a significant connection between mindfulness and frequency of playing which is associated to accessing flow.",
              "Yet, part time musicians found that a professional musician\u2019s occupation became routine and likely inhibited flow.",
              "To clarify, mindfulness has described as a connecting bridge between our mind and the present moment, allowing the person to stay aware of what is happening in that very moment [21].",
              "Therefore, mindfulness appears to share similar attributes that may support flow state facilitation.",
              "Additionally, the struggle of financial security for occupational musicians placed stress on many musicians which also was distracting from achieving flow states.",
              "Therefore, it is worth considering the difference of recreational and occupational roles and the related levels of task frequency regarding perceived expertise when measuring flow states.",
              "When delving further into what flow is and how far reaching and common flow states are in modern society, it is also important to understand why flow is so relevant to modern day society.",

              "When in a flow state, the individual is considered to perform at their full capacity [22,23].",
              "Flow has commonly been associated with intense concentration [9], a higher behavioral efficiency and creativity [24], and heightened sense of playfulness [25].",
              "Furthermore, the intrinsic rewards associated with autotelic experience is likely to increase learning efficiencies [24], as well as better remembering of the experience and also more likely to seek such experiences more often [9].",

              "Flow is also characterized by an elevated sense of self-control [26] and higher positive subjective experiences [7].",
              "The primary method of studying flow has been through questionnaires as well as interviews for more qualitative explorations.",
              "For example, Larson and Csikszentmihalyi [27] developed the experience sample method (ESM) which would ask participants to mark in real time at certain times throughout their day of their flow experience.",
              "The problem with this and other methods is, as was already stated, flow states require acute concentration to the point where little to no attentional resources is misallocated.",
              "Also, the individual experiences a loss of self-consciousness where self-reflective thoughts and fear of social evaluation are not present.",
              "Therefore, the introspection necessary for these measuring techniques has the danger of inhibiting the flow experience as it requires resources to be allocated to a different cognitive set as these are retrospective by nature [28].",
              "Since ESM, the Flow State Scale (FSS) was introduced, which operationalizes flow by transforming it\u2019s nine elements into dimensions that load equally on a composite flow score [29].",
              "The FSS considers flow as a \u2018degree\u2019 of flow on a continuum instead of a discrete \u2018peak\u2019 experience, which can be used to portray the experiential quality as a level of intensity of flow within the activity [3].",
              "The intensity of the flow experience is considered to elevate as more of the nine elements increase in score.",
              "The FSS is typically given at the end of a task in order not to force the participant out of the state during the task, however, people will experience a range of affective states across trial periods [30].",
              "Self-reported flow experience scales at the end of a task measure the experience across the whole task rather than for a particular time period.",
              "This may further be influenced by the recency effect in memory which may color the memory of the entire trial by the most recent experience toward the end of the trial [31].",
              "Such pitfalls of studying the dynamics underpinning flow states limit how far researchers explore this elusive state to optimal performance and our understanding of consciousness.",
              "Researchers have since begun to address this limitation through the use of psychophysiological methodologies, which focus on the expression of psychological phenomena in bodily processes, to explore the dynamic nature of flow experience throughout the entire task.",
              "Psychophysiological measures\u2014such as hypnosis, meditation and sleep\u2014have been employed to explore the more complex physiological aspects of human consciousness.",

              "More recently electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are shedding new light on the neurocognitive elements of flow states.",
              "However, these studies have not accumulated enough evidence to define a common acceptance of the neurocognitive functioning and thus researchers continue to address flow states from different methodological backgrounds and these different motivations result in differing perspectives.",
              "Select studies have now begun to measure flow states and demonstrate the psychological effects of flow with physiological results utilizing various physiological variations to justify experimental design decisions, yet this results in conflicting results from multiple research queries.",

The majority of research [34] have found a consensus about the nature of the explicit system, different to the implicit system, as a rule based system linked to language function and conscious awareness across many tasks, e.",

              "Conscious awareness has been described along similar lines as the implicit and explicit system with both on and offline systems that work to establish consciousness.",
              "Systems offline to consciousness are reflexive, rigid and fast responding, such as a frog snapping at a fly.",
              "However, as it is organizationally inefficient to house the ever-increasing number of complex reflexes, a more effective system proposed would be to include a temporary buffer that enables the organism to examine multiple representation of the plan of action before making a decision [38].",
              "Conscious online elements appear to share a close relationship with working memory and executive control.",
              "Executive control directs our attention and the working memory.",

              "Findings on the association between the prefrontal cortex with this prevailing model was developed by Crick and Koch [38] which states that conscious awareness can only exist if the brain activity projects to the prefrontal cortex.",
              "Crick and Koch\u2019s theory however is not a complete theory of conscious awareness and therefore we are relegated to using the operational definition that explicit processes are able to be explained verbally [38].",
              "Studies have started identifying the prefrontal regions involvement in the explicit system due to evidence of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) acting both as a working memory buffer for the content of consciousness, as well as selecting content through the executive attentional network [39,40].",
              "The medial temporal lobe structures have also been identified as relevant underlying circuitry [41].",
              "An argument has been presented that the explicit system is a more recent evolutionary occurrence and present in animals with more highly developed prefrontal areas [42].",
              "Support is found for this in the late phylogeny and ontogeny development of the prefrontal cortex [43].",
              "Furthermore, the structure of information processing is known to be hierarchical and due to the sophistication of the explicit knowledge representation, such higher order structures are believed to be localized in the prefrontal areas [42].",

              "The emotional tract processes more typically in a non-algorithmic skill-based manner that attaches values to help evaluate the biological significance of the information.",
              "The second tract performs detailed featured analysis in a computational mode free from any interpretations of salient information.",
              "Whilst both pathways begin to converge at the thalamus, the cognitive pathway feeds through the hippocampal formation and temporal, occipital and parietal cortices (TOP), helping provide a degree of selective attention required to process incoming information [44].",
              "As connections continue to take place along the hierarchical pathways, full convergence appears to occur at the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) [45].",
              "The DLPFC is primarily involved in executive functioning by enabling higher functionality such as self-reflective consciousness, abstract thinking, and theory of mind [46].",
              "Furthermore, it plans, formulating appropriate strategies and subsequently directs the motor cortices to initiate the process.",
              "It is at these prefrontal functioning in which the control over the cortices are the most sophisticated.",
              "The DLPFC is also responsible for temporal integration [47], directed and sustained attention [48], and working memory [45], which facilitate an intricate cognitive framework that actively attends to information, thus affording a buffer to hold such information in mind, whilst organizing it in space-time [40].",
              "This cognitive tract is broken up into two attentional tracts of its own: Top down and bottom-up processing.",
              "As explained by Corbetta and Shulman [49], voluntary shifts of attention are thought to be mediated by the dorsal frontoparietal system resulting in goal-directed, \u201ctop-down\u201d signals arising from knowledge about the current activity such as finding your way home.",
              "On the other hand, the ventral frontoparietal system mediates the automatic \u201cbottom-up\u201d capture of attention guided by salient properties inherent in the stimuli, such as your unique and alarming ringtone.",
              "The DLPFC has been shown to exhibit a top-down functionality which inhibits maladaptive and inappropriate cognitive and emotional behavior [50].",
              "The frontal lobes appear to be based on more universal principles which inhibit people from compulsively acting on immediate cues [51].",
              "Therefore, the frontal lobes help free us from slavery to direct environmental triggers.",
              "It is the inhibitory abilities of the top-down processes that allow a person to remain task focused and not be guided by more salient bottom up processes [52].",
              "The two predominant neurocognitive theories of flow states have helped guide flow research to better understand its function in order to be able to further support access and entry into flow.",

              "This reduction of frontal activity is expected to reduce interference from explicit processing such as self-referential thought and thereby freeing up more resources to be dedicated to the faster implicit processing system such as actioning of automatized processes.",
              "Recently studies have begun using psychophysiological measures to test the THH of flow experiences with a variety of testing for Electroencephalography (EEG) with shooting [53], arithmetic [54], video games [55] and memory tasks [56], as well as Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) for arithmetic tasks [57,58].",

              "Whilst there were only 2 channels in the study (FP1/2), the results supported the THH in which a negative correlation was associated between higher flow states resulting in a suppression of prefrontal activity.",
              "However, the synchronization theory of flow (STF) proposed by Weber and Tamborini [60] disputes the THH due to many flow-like activities such as hypnosis and meditation showing strong frontal activity in neuroimaging studies occurring when in these altered states of consciousness as well as in flow studies [61].",
              "Therefore, STF instead focusses on the neuronal efficient, feature binding processes of synchronizing neurons and networks to more effectively communicate and create \u201cholistic, higher-order experiences\u201d that resemble flow states.",

              "g., Schacter) who hold that \u2018implicit\u2019 implies no conscious awareness of the details or even that a memory was stored, a weaker criterion is used for category learning, which only requires that the nature of learning has no conscious access [34].",

              "It is long known that to effectively multitask two things simultaneously requires one task to be implicit [94].",
              "Thereby, implicit systems are ultimately more efficient than their explicit counterpart.",
              "People that have entered flow states often refer to an automatic processing in which they report task focused behaviour without conscious thinking which suggests a form of frontal inhibition required for successful entry into the state.",
              "Furthermore, a key site of pleasurable experience of rewards is associated with the dopamine rich striatum, due to dopamine\u2019s role in rewarding behavior by predicting rewarding outcomes that would result in reward-seeking experiences [95], which lends support to the autotelic nature of flow states.",
              "Because of the autotelic nature and high criticality of flow, we are moved to consider the role of novelty as relevant to the induction of flow states.",
              "In the novelty hypothesis, during a period of high criticality, when a person is exposed to a new situation that results in a challenge that is equal to the skill level, the person may be pushed up into a level in which their skill is just below the level of challenge being presented.",
              "This additional stimulation may be enough to absorb the final amount of explicit buffering systems in order to fully immerse the performer in the task.",
              "As flow states are considered a complex combination of multiple cognitive features it has been difficult to delineate specific neurocognitive markers.",
              "Studies for the most part still rely on a mix between psychophysiological measures and probing post-task self-report questionnaires.",
              "The conflict still remains that as soon as the participant is asked about their experience, they are forced to self-reflect which will move them out of the flow state.",
              "We can therefore begin to break down some of the key neurological elements to test whether they can be defined as key elements of flow states in order to further identify key elements that may be relevant to the neurocognitive functionality of flow states.",
              "Particular elements of flow to be defined are that it occurs within an activity which is balanced with an individual\u2019s abilities, whilst fully immersed in the task and self-referential thoughts are completely inhibited.",
              "However, we can look at previous studies looking at similar cognitive functions such as expert performance, creativity, focused attention and mental workload to help delineate neurocognitive landmarks that will help us identify the elements of flow activity.",
              "The EEG is a well validated measure for examining psychological states during skilled motor performance [96,97].",
              "In particular, results have highlighted the left frontal and temporal regions as playing key roles in expert performance with increased alpha power in EEG occurring in expert marksmen compared to novice shooters [96,97,98].",
              "EEG has also been used across a range of activities including weightlifting [99], golf [100] and archery [101] all revealing a reduction in left hemispheric activity.",
              "In a recent study, a comparison of neuro-anatomical characteristics also showed that expert divers have significantly increased cortical thickness in the left superior temporal sulcus compared to the non-athlete group [102].",
              "The superior temporal gyrus houses several important cortical structures, including Wernicke\u2019s area known to be involved in the comprehension of language.",
              "To follow on, this pattern of increased alpha activity in the left temporal region has been most commonly interpreted as representing a reduction in cortical activations, reducing verbalizations associated with the left brain and enabling more resources to be allocated to the visual-spatial processes of the right brain [103].",
              "This has been further supported by lower coherence estimates of left temporal regions with motor regions by expert marksmen [104].",
              "This pattern suggests less cortico-cortical communication and a suppression of analytic processing influence thus simplifying a complex process and alleviating the need for a division of cognitive resources.",
              "Additionally, a key antecedent of flow utilizes the challenge/skills-balance which indicates a state of high mental workload from deep involvement in the task [9].",
              "This has been shown in psychophysiological studies on flow, in which decreased heart rate variability was shown during challenge/ skills-balance in a knowledge task [105].",
              "EEG has also been used to evaluate mental workload in which a reduction of alpha activity and an increase of theta is present due to the tasks increased difficulty levels [106,107].",
              "Alpha frequencies are categorized into three frequency bands (8\u201313 Hz, 8\u201310 Hz, and 11\u201313 Hz).",
              "Alpha activity in general (8\u201313 Hz) represents lower levels of consciousness and awareness, while an alpha reduction results in increased mental activity [108].",
              "The low alpha band (8\u201310 Hz) is associated with the mechanisms of arousal, attention and effort as well as general cognitive processing while high alpha (11\u201313 Hz) selectively acts according to the encoding of the stimulus [109].",
              "Sports performance has also been shown to improve when implementing hypnotic techniques using flow state suggestions [110,111,112].",
              "It is not yet understood how hypnosis increases performance or the experience of flow.",
              "One suggestion by Crawford and Gruzelier [113] is a shift is made from an analytical think style to become more holistic after hypnosis, allowing access to processes that are important for athletic performance.",
              "Shifts from the left (analytical verbal and conscious side of the brain) to the right hemisphere (holistic, nonverbal, imaginative side of the brain) have been shown during hypnosis [114].",
              "It has been further shown that there are strong correlations between hypnosis with absorption [115].",
              "A correlation has also been shown between absorption and dissociation, in which the ability to become absorbed in a task is another way to induce dissociative control [116].",
              "Task absorption and dissociation are considered key component to the higher levels of the flow phenomenology.",
              "Additionally, theta activity has been shown as relevant for evaluating cognitive processing during flow like tasks such as meditation.",
              "Lutz et al.",
              "[117] experienced meditators and novices were tested at the beginning and end of a three-month meditation retreat, using an attentional blink test.",
              "In experienced meditators, results significantly improved whilst presenting increased theta phase-locking, i.",
              "e., a reduced variability of theta phases across trials.",
              "These results are considered to show a more stable execution of neural processing [118].",
              "Furthermore, multiple fMRI studies have highlighted attentional networks providing support for increased activity in prefrontal networks during focused [119], meditation-like attention [120].",
              "Positive affect and motivational orientation, two elements associated with flow phenomenology, have also found links to changes in frontal EEG asymmetry [121].",
              "In particular, increased left alpha frontal activation was correlated with approach-related motivation [122].",
              "This is also shown by higher activity of the frontal left associated with trait measures of behavioral activation [123].",
              "Specifically, positive emotions were correlated with high left frontal activity, while negative emotions were correlated with increased relative right frontal activity [124].",
              "Ultimately a pattern of the relationship between frontal EEG asymmetry, motivational direction, and affective valence has been shown for performance settings.",
              "To further test the neurocognitive mechanisms of different states and in particular flow states, technologies such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been utilized to provide a clearer understanding on the underlying processes.",
              "TDCS is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation that alters cortical excitability based on the direction of current flow at subthreshold levels of the neuronal membrane potential.",
              "Anodal stimulation has been shown to increase cortical excitability over the region of electrode placement, while cathodal stimulation inhibits the region\u2019s neuronal excitability.",
              "The level of neuronal activity modulation depends on the current density, which is governed by elements such as current strength and electrode variability.",
              "Furthermore, the length of after-effects is dependent on stimulation duration.",
              "i.",
              "e., excitability effects have been shown to last up to 60 min [125], yet results have also shown effects fading after 30 min of stimulation [126].",
              "While tDCS has been used for clinical settings such as depression, Parkinson\u2019s disease and pain management, it has also shown to improve performance in normal participants including working memory [127], visuo-motor learning [128], and categorical learning [129].",
              "Many experimental paradigms have been implemented on motor learning including the more frequently used: skill acquisition and adaptation [130].",
              "New motor skill acquisition involves the ability to execute new motor abilities that improve performance beyond previous levels.",
              "Skill acquisition can take weeks or months while skill can decrease due to a lack of ongoing practice.",
              "Strategies that improve skill acquisition and retention can be of great scientific and practical interest.",
              "For instance, Clark & Coffman [131] showed a unique use of anodal tDCS over parietal and frontal regions for improving skill acquisition speeds by enhancing performance in threat detection within natural scenes that are typically relevant for the effective management of many skills throughout our everyday and specialized work tasks.",
              "Adaptation for sensorimotor tasks, unlike skill acquisition, addresses a new framework of well learned movements and spatial goals instead of requiring new capabilities of muscle activations to be updated.",
              "While adaptation can be assisted with explicit control processes, it can also update entirely implicitly [132].",
              "Functionally, adaptation focusses on an error decrease by changing challenge levels to facilitate a return to the previous level of performance, while participants movements are updated due to changes in motor outputs or sensory inputs.",
              "TDCS has been shown specifically to enhance adaptation of real world cognitive multi-tasks by specifically targeting the goal-directed dorsal attention network by right parietal anodal stimulation and thereby resulting in improved task performance [133].",
              "It is important to acknowledge that tDCS has been shown to result in ceiling effects for experts compared to novice performers in which at a certain level of expertise, tDCS has been shown to not have a significant impact on performance [134,135,136,137].",
              "More recently tDCS has begun to be implemented to explore its potential role in facilitating flow.",
              "In a recent study, Ulrich et al.",
              ", [138] facilitated higher flow scores for people experiencing low flow after stimulating them during an arithmetic task with a prefrontal (fpZ) anodal tDCS to target the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC).",
              "This is an interesting result as Ulrich et al.",
              ", [57] showed support for the THH with a deactivation of MPFC during an fMRI study on flow, interpreted as a reduction of explicit functionality of self-referential activity, yet only the excitatory anodal tDCS over the prefrontal regions resulted in an enhancement toward flow states.",
              "This was uniquely for people specifically experiencing low flow in which more research is needed for the general population.",
              "A tDCS study by Gold & Ciorciari [139] explored flow for novice gamers who typically didn\u2019t find during videogames and expert video gamers who did.",
              "The tDCS set up focused on an anodal right parietal and cathodal left frontal stimulation that also showed support for flow state induction, this time in alignment with a deactivation of MPFC associated with high flow states.",
              "Therefore, we see here an introduction into the facilitative role of tDCS experience enhancement that can potentially improve people\u2019s skill level in order that the participant could reach the skill-challenge balance [133] that allows for a greater movement into flow states [140].",
              "Other transcranial stimulation technologies may be worth considering for future research on flow that may also show a facilitative effect such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) which stimulate at a specific frequency and has shown to result in entrainment of neural networks to improve cognitive performance such as spatial reasoning [141] and working memory [142].",
              "This collection of results from the literature begins to show what type of elements in a person\u2019s professional environment need to be taken into consideration to help facilitate flow along with an understanding of the importance of supporting a transference of skills from explicit knowledge systems to implicit procedural systems. The literature appeared to highlight the role of the BG and its related components as a key research direction in which to further explore to enable a greater facilitation of skill automaticity that appears highly related to flow state.",
              "Furthermore, there appears to be support in the literature for a particular neurocognitive activity pattern for flow induction in which expertise and flow studies appear to show a hemispheric shift away from the frontal left evidenced by a resulting reduction of left frontal activity and an increase in frontal alpha while facilitating a greater allocation of neuronal resources to the visual-spatial processes of the right brain, thus resulting in higher levels of performance.",
              "Recent interventions such as tDCS have been shown to have a positive effect on the facilitation of flow states that have followed this pattern and with more research may prove to be an effective intervention for real life applications as they are low cost, safe and non-invasive.",

              "Biasutti (2017a) also suggests that having clear mental plans for the performance and knowing all the variables in advance can help the performer attain a flow state.",

              "He identified five constitutive dispositions of this tendency to experience a flow state: self-confidence, the desire to experiment and express something through the activity, having goals, the ability to maintain one\u2019s attention, and the ability to perform without self-criticism.",
              "Flow can be experienced at several levels, with the highest form occurring during the activity itself.",
              "The normal concept of flow is considered as a state characterized by a natural and regular \u201cchallenge\u2013skills balance\u201d experience allowing performers to be absorbed in their experience, but to still be able to have some kind of \u201caction-awareness.",

              "On the other hand, an unfavorable environment, as well as internal factors like anxiety and impatience all have the ability to hinder the emergence of flow.",
              "Flow states and the music performance anxiety (MPA) could be considered antithetical experiences (Cohen, and Bodner, 2019), and pre-performance anxiety could play a role in the achievement of optimal performance states (Hanin, 2000;",

              "In such contexts, flow emerges as a result of a gradual accumulation of confidence during performance (Swann et al.",

              "Specifically, a constructive first event, leading to positive feedback increases the performer\u2019s confidence.",
              "This process is repeated until the performer reaches a level of total confidence that allows him/her to pursue the objectives, and challenge him/herself to explore his/her own limits and thus enter into a flow state.",
              "Another important issue for our understanding of flow relates to the extent to which flow states can be controlled and how the frequency and intensity of flow experiences can be systematically increased.",
              "The literature is currently divided on this issue, with some scholars arguing that with appropriate exercises, athletes and musicians can develop control over flow states (Jackson, 1995), while others consider that it is difficult to regulate flow, although it is possible to acquire a mental attitude that facilitates reaching flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).",
              "For example, in a study involving elite athletes, Jackson (1995) collected views about the controllability of flow in which 71% of the athletes considered flow to be under volitional control through elements, such as physical and mental preparation.",

              "Activities, such as managing emotions, managing thoughts, developing intrinsic motivation, concentrating and focus, mental practice, imagery and visualization, calming the body and mind, and pre-performance plans, could be undertaken in order to facilitate flow appearance (Sinnamon, 2020).",
              "While numerous studies have explored flow states in sports and music, the characteristics and actions that lead to the entrance and/or exit from flow states are difficult to clearly identify and are largely unknown.",
              "Moreover, it is important for flow research to ascertain detailed aspects and to be specific about the possible directions of the study.",
