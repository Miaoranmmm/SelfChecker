There is no simple or definitive answer to it, as different perspectives may have different views on the causes, effects and solutions of income inequality.

Some of the factors that contribute to income inequality include:\n\n- Differences in education levels, skills and opportunities\n- Geographic conditions and access to resources\n- Heritages and inheritances\n- Tax policies and regulations\n- Trade and globalization\n- Outsourcing and automation\n- Discrimination and prejudice\n- Life choices and work ethics\n\nSome of the possible ways to address income inequality include:\n\n- Increasing the minimum wage and ensuring fair labor conditions\n- Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and other social safety nets\n- Building assets and savings for working families\n- Investing in education and training programs for all\n- Making the tax code more progressive and closing loopholes\n- Ending residential segregation and promoting diversity\n- Supporting trade policies that protect workers' rights and environmental standards\n- Reducing corruption and improving governance\n\nThese are just some of the suggestions that have been proposed by various experts, organizations and activists. However, there may be trade-offs, challenges and disagreements involved in implementing them.

              "They include (i) The level of economic development, (ii) The level of technological development, (iii) Social-political unrest, (iv) The savings rate, (v) The imperfection of credit markets, (vi) The political economy, (vii) Institutions and (viii) The fertility rate.",
              "Based on the transmission mechanisms of these models, we found that the relationship between income inequality and growth can be negative, positive or inconclusive.",
              "The first three models demonstrate that the relationship is inconclusive, the fourth shows that it is positive, while the remainder indicate that the relationship should be negative.",
              "In the face of theoretical ambiguity, we also noted that the empirical findings on the relationship between income inequality and growth are highly debatable.",
              "These findings can be broadly classified into four categories, namely negative, positive, inconclusive and no relationship.",
              "Based on these findings, we provide a critical survey on methodology issues employed in the prior studies and propose a better methodology to researchers for future studies.",
              "Specification table Across countries, the unequal distribution of income and resources among the population is the defining challenge of our time.",
              "In both developed and developing economies, the income inequality gap (as measured by the decile ratios and the Gini coefficient based on the Lorenz curve) between rich and poor is at high levels, and continues to rise [24].",
              "When income inequality becomes extremely high, it fuels social dissatisfaction and raises the threat of social and political unrest [13].",
              "In similar vein, Alesina and Perotti [8]:1 argue that high income inequality, \u201cby increasing the probability of coups, revolutions, mass violence or, more generally, by increasing policy uncertainty and threatening property rights, has a negative effect on investment and, as a consequence, reduces growth\u201d.",
              "Given the already high level of income inequality and rising trends in many countries, along with the potentially negative consequences for economies, we found that a significant body of literature examines the causes of income inequality and its consequences for economic development.",
              "Among them were theoretical analyses of the inequality\u2013growth nexus, which identified various transmission mechanisms linking income inequality to economic growth.",
              "These include (i) The level of economic development, (ii) The level of technological development, (iii) Social-political unrest, (iv) The savings rate, (v) The imperfection of credit markets, (vi) The political economy, (vii) Institutions and (viii) The fertility rate.",
              "Based on these models, we found that the relationship between income inequality and growth can be negative, positive or inconclusive.",
              "Theories on the level of economic development (see [7,31,38,54]) and technological development (see [6,29,33]) demonstrate that the relationship between inequality and growth changes from positive to negative as the level of development increases.",
              "Inconclusive results are also echoed by the social-political unrest model, which argues that the socio-political unrest stemming from high income inequality can either inhibit or benefit growth (see [13,14,56,62]).",
              "In addition, theories on the political economy (see [9,11,13,46,48,50]), the imperfection of credit markets (see [5,12,30,51];",
              "Panniza, [46]), institutions (see [22,34,61]) and the fertility rate (see [26]) demonstrate that income inequality is negatively related to growth.",
              "The only theory which supports the positive relationship between income inequality and growth is the theory on the savings rate (see [3,17,42,53]).",
              "Given such theoretical ambiguity, it is little wonder that the empirical findings on the relationship between income inequality and growth are strongly debated.",
              "Early empirical studies by Alesina and Rodrik [9], Persson and Tabellini [50] and Perotti [49] reported that inequality exerted a negative impact on growth.",
              "That negative relationship has been confirmed by numerous subsequent studies (see, for example, Panniza, [18,19,46,55,64]).",
              "Evidence of a negative relationship has, however, been challenged by studies which reported positive results on the inequality\u2013growth nexus (see, for example, [28,39,57,58]).",
              "In addition, several studies have yielded inconclusive findings, with most reporting that the relationship is positive in high-income and negative in low-income countries (see, for example, [13,20,25,27]).",
              "A few studies found no relationship between inequality and growth (see [15,44]).",
              "Given the above background, the aim here is to provide a comprehensive literature review of the relationship between income inequality and economic growth, both in theory and empirically.",
              "While Section 2 critically analyses the theoretical framework of the income inequality\u2013growth nexus, Section 3 reviews empirical studies on this relationship.",
              "Section 4 provides a critical survey on methodology issues employed in the prior studies and proposes a better methodology that can help reconcile the literature.",
              "Section 5 concludes the study.",
              "A theoretical analysis of the inequality\u2013growth nexus has identified various transmission mechanisms in which income inequality is linked to economic growth.",
              "These mechanisms are discussed in detail in this section.",
              "Early researchers explored the link between income inequality and growth through the lens of the developmental stage of the economy.",
              "Kuznets [38] documented that the relationship between the two variables relies on the level of economic development of a country, meaning there is a differential relationship between income inequality and growth, with a positive relationship during the early stage of economic development and a negative relationship during the mature stage.",
              "This may be attributed to shifts of labor, from one sector to other, developed sectors.",
              "For example, when labor moves from the agricultural sector to other sectors of the economy, the per capita income of those individuals increases, as their skills are in demand in those sectors.",
              "Individuals who remain in the agricultural sector keep earning a low income, thus income inequality increases during this stage.",
              "As the economy develops, with labour continuing to move from agriculture to other sectors, individuals who remain in the agricultural sector will earn higher incomes due to the low supply of labour in that sector.",
              "Income inequality thus declines during this stage.",
              "Kuznets [38] describes the relationship as an inverted U-hypothesis, which advocates that inequality tends to increase during early stages of economic development and decrease during later stages.",
              "This argument is supported by Ahluwalia [7], Robinson [54] and Gupta and Singh [31].",
              "In addition to sectoral change, Galor and Tsiddon [29], Helpman [33] and Aghion et al.",
              "[6] explored the link by connecting income inequality to the developmental stage of technology.",
              "During the early stages of technological development, innovative ideas in the economic sector result in increases in income inequality.",
              "This is due to the fact that new technology requires highly skilled labor and training, which raises wages in these sectors compared to those sectors which use old technology.",
              "As a result, employees in the new sector earn high per-capita incomes, while those working in the sector with old machines continue earning lower incomes.",
              "Therefore, income inequality increases during the early stages of technological improvements.",
              "However, as the economy moves to the more mature stage of technological development, income inequality decreases, the reason being that as more labour shifts to the sector using new technology, the incomes of those who remained in the sector with old technology also increase due to the low supply in labor in that sector.",
              "Therefore, the wage differential gap between them declines, leading to a decrease in income inequality.",
              "The role of technology was probed further by researchers who focused on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).",
              "By implementing modern technologies, 4IR will lead to the continuing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial processes.",
              "As Krueger [37] documented, improvements in technology widen the income inequality gap in the labor market between skilled and lowly skilled labour, because the income of highly skilled labor increases (as those individuals are in demand), while lowly skilled laborers continue earning low incomes.",
              "In similar vein, 4IR is skills-biased, which leads to a widening of the income inequality gap [1].",
              "Based on this argument, technological improvements can be harmful to growth, due to concerns about growing inequality and unemployment.",
              "Some studies argue that the rise of socio-political unrest, stemming from high income inequality, may dampen growth (see [13,14,62]).",
              "In countries with extreme wealth and income inequality, there are high levels of social unrest that cause people to engage in strikes, criminality and other unproductive activities.",
              "This often results in wastage of government resources and disruptions that threaten the political stability of the country.",
              "It causes uncertainty in government and slows down productivity in the economy, while discouraging investment.",
              "By contrast, high income inequality due to the rise of socio-political unrest can promote growth.",
              "To reduce the number of strikes, criminal activity, uncertainty and political unrest, politicians and leaders favor redistribution \u2013 from the rich to the poor \u2013 in the form of a transfer of payments.",
              "In turn, this creates a safety net for the population and government to restore society's trust in government.",
              "As a result, levels of uncertainty decline and investment increases, prompting an increase in the growth rate in the long run [13,14,62].",
              "Similarly, Saint-Paul and Verdier [56] demonstrate that, in the presence of high income inequality, the median voter favors a transfer of payments by means of public expenditure, such as financing education.",
              "This, in turn, increases human capital for the poor to access education, thereby promoting growth.",
              "Political economy models demonstrate that high income inequality may hinder growth (see [9,13,48]).",
              "The law and government play crucial roles in the economy, with government in charge of the redistribution of income and resources among the population.",
              "These models reveal that when the mean income is greater than that of the median voter, people support the redistribution of income and resources (from the rich to the poor).",
              "Redistribution takes place through a transfer of payments and public expenditure, such as the establishment of health facilities and the building of schools, among others.",
              "This kind of redistribution reduces growth in the long run, however, by discouraging innovation and investment, and causing low productivity [9,13,48].",
              "In addition, when there is high income inequality, the population demands equal distribution.",
              "That sometimes results in riots and other unproductive activities which retard economic growth.",
              "Furthermore, factors such as lobbying and rent-seeking, which often occur during the political process, also discourage growth.",
              "This happens when those in the upper decile of income distribution prevent the redistribution of income and resources to the poor, resulting in a wastage of government funds and corruption, both of which hamper economic growth in the long run [11,46,48,50].",

              "This limits the ability to borrow and returns on investment.",
              "In addition, imperfect laws make it difficult for creditors to collect defaulted loans, because the law might protect the assets of the borrower from being repossessed as collateral.",
              "Such laws constrain the collection of debt, leading to the hard terms and conditions faced by potential creditors.",
              "This prohibits access to credit for some individuals, in particular the poor.",
              "Given that investment depends on how much income and how many assets an individual has, the poor (who only have income for basic necessities) are unable to afford investment opportunities with high returns (for instance, to invest in human capital or property, among others).",
              "For this reason, extremely high income inequality reduces investment opportunities, leading to declining growth in the long run.",
              "Existing studies report that income inequality exerts a positive impact on economic growth through savings rates (see [3,13,17]).",
              "According to these studies, savings are a function of income.",
              "As income earned increases, so the savings rate rises, and vice versa.",
              "In the presence of high income inequality, rich people earn high incomes which help them to save more, because their marginal propensity to save is relatively high.",
              "This increases the aggregate savings, leading to a rise in capital accumulation, thereby enhancing economic growth in the long run (see [3], [17], [42], [53], [66]).",
              "Following on this argument, Shin [59] demonstrates that the redistribution of income and resources from rich to poor is harmful to growth.",
              "Such action reduces the income, wealth and other resources of the rich, leading to a decline in the marginal propensity to save.",
              "As a result, aggregate savings and investments decline.",
              "Several studies illustrate that income inequality inhibits growth through institutions (see [22,34,61]).",

              "High income inequality creates fertile ground for bad institutions, and exacerbates inequality and inefficiency, which leads to low growth rates in the long run.",
              "In the case of high income inequality, political decisions tend to be biased towards enriching the already rich minority, at the expense of the poor.",
              "This results in poor policies, leading to a high level of inefficiency, wastage of state resources, social dissatisfaction and political instability.",
              "It further perpetuates inequality and inhibits growth in the long run [34,61].",
              "Based on this argument, bad institutions tend to associate with extreme records of inequality, inefficiency and sluggish growth.",
              "By contrast, good institutions tend to associate with low inequality, productivity and economic growth.",
              "Income inequality has been found to negatively affect growth through differences in fertility (see [26]).",
              "This study documented that a widening income inequality gap raises differences in fertility between the rich and the poor in a population.",
              "The low-income group usually have many children, and tend to invest less in their children's education due to a lack of financial resources.",
              "By contrast, those in the high-income group usually have fewer children and invest more in their education.",
              "Therefore, in the case of extreme income inequality, the high fertility differential has a negative impact on human capital, leading to a decline in economic growth.",
              "Given such theoretical ambiguity, the empirical findings on the relationship between income inequality and growth are also highly debatable.",
              "These findings can broadly be classified into four categories, namely negative, positive, inconclusive and no relationship.",
              "The earliest empirical studies examining the inequality\u2013growth nexus were conducted in the 1990s, and employed the ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimation techniques (see [9,49,50]).",

              "By the late 1990s, however, the general consensus on the negative relationship between income inequality and growth was challenged by concerns over data quality and the methodological procedures used (see Neves and |Silva, [43]).",
              "With regard to the data quality, some studies argued that the dataset used in the previous studies, which lacked comparability due to the use of different income definitions (gross income versus expenditures) can lead to different results (see [10,36]).",
              "According to Knowles [36], European countries, the U.",
              "S.",

              "Concerning the methodological procedures, there has been a shift on the usage of panel data instead of cross-sectional data in the later studies.",
              "Forbes [28] argues that the use of panel data is desirable as it can specifically estimate how a change in a country's level of inequality within a given country will affect growth in that country.",
              "In addition, panel data can remove bias from the correlation between time-variant, observable country characteristics and the explanatory variables by controlling for differences in these characteristics.",
              "Due to these considerations, many studies started to use panel data (see [13,28,39];",

              "However, the use of panel data in the studies may lead to more diverse results.",
              "One of the possible explanations is the diversity of estimators employed in the panel studies.",
              "While most of the cross-section studies use OLS, panel studies use a wide variety of estimators such as fixed effects, random effects, GMM, etc.",
              "Given that these estimators have different underlying assumptions, they are likely to produce different results among the panel studies [43].",
              "Another possible explanation is that, unlike the cross-section data, panel data controls for time-variant, observable country characteristics.",
              "Given that the impact of inequality on growth tends to differ across countries and regions, the inter-continental variation contribute a substantial part of the effect.",
              "Therefore, the usage of panel data analysis may lead to different results when different samples are used in the studies.",
              "With the wider usage of various panel data estimation techniques in the later studies, it is not surprising that we found more diverse results in the inequality-growth literature.",
              "Based on the above considerations, researchers should be more cautious when identifying a general global pattern regarding the inequality-growth relationship.",
              "Instead, we propose that more emphasis should be placed on identifying the inequality-growth relationship on a national or regional level.",

              "This paper presented a comprehensive literature review of the relationship between income inequality and economic growth.",
              "In the theoretical literature, various transmission mechanisms were identified in which income inequality is linked to economic growth, namely the level of economic development, the level of technological development, social-political unrest, the political economy, the imperfection of credit markets, the savings rate, institutions, and the fertility rate.",
              "Based on these models, we found that the relationship between income inequality and growth can be negative, positive or inconclusive.",

              "Inconclusive results were reported by the social-political unrest model, showing that the rise in socio-political unrest stemming from high-income inequality could either dampen or promote growth.",
              "In addition, theories on the political economy, the imperfection of credit markets, institutions and the fertility rate, reported that income inequality was negatively related to growth.",

              "In the methodology section, we provided a critical survey on methodology issues employed in the prior studies.",
              "We argued that the varying results obtained by these studies can be attributed to empirical aspects such as the data comparability and methodological procedures used.",
              "We, therefore, suggest that future studies should place more emphasis on identifying the inequality-growth relationship on a national or regional level to better understand the inequality-growth process on the study area.",
              "In addition, we conjecture that as the study countries and time span differed in the empirical studies, the impacts of the various theoretical channels we identified previously could also play a uniquely important role in affecting the relationship of the inequality\u2013growth nexus in those studies.",

              "After all, wealthier families are able to afford expensive private schools, or homes in wealthy public school districts with more educational resources.",
              "But a closer look at this education achievement gap over the past 50 years or so shows that the gap only began to widen in the 1970s, right about the time that wealth and income inequality in our nation also began to grow.",
              "The past 30 years have seen a sustained rise in inequality in wages, incomes, and wealth, leading to more and more income and wealth accruing to those at the top of the economic ladder, pulling the rich further away from those on the other rungs.",
              "1 At the same time, the growing educational gap became ever more apparent.",
              "In the 1980s, the gap between the reading and math skills of the wealthiest 10 percent of kids and poorest 10 percent was about 90 points on an 800-point SAT-type scale.",

              "5 The growth of the socioeconomic achievement gap appears to be largely because more affluent parents are increasingly investing more time and money in their kids\u2019 educational enrichment\u2014and at earlier periods in their children\u2019s lives\u2014than hard-pressed low-income and middle class families.",
              "6 Indeed, surveys show that the amount of time and money parents invest in their children has grown sharply over the past four decades among both affluent and non-affluent parents.",

              "7 Economists Richard Murnane of Harvard University and Greg Duncan at the University of California-Irvine find that between 1972 and 2006 the amount high-income families spent on their children\u2019s enrichment activities grew by 150 percent, while the amount spent by low-income families grew by 57 percent.",
              "8 In part, parents are spending more on their kids because they understand that educational success is increasingly important in today\u2019s uncertain economic times, a point that sociologist Marianne Cooper at the Clayman Institute makes in her recent book \u201cCut Adrift.",

              "10 Thus, it appears that the academic gap is widening because rich students are increasingly entering kindergarten much better prepared to succeed in school than low- and middle-class students.",
              "To be sure, there are important differences in the quality of schools serving low- and high-income students, but these differences do not appear to be as salient as the differences in children\u2019s experiences prior to kindergarten.",

              "Third, although rising income inequality may play a role in the growing income achievement gap, it does not appear to be the dominant factor.",
              "The gap appears to have grown at least partly because of an increase in the association between family income and children's academic achievement for families above the median income level: a given difference in family incomes now corresponds to a 30 to 60 percent larger difference in achievement than it did for children born in the 1970s.",
              "Moreover, evidence from other studies suggests that this may be in part a result of increasing parental investment in children's cognitive development.",
              "Finally, the growing income achievement gap does not appear to be a result of a growing achievement gap between children with highly and less-educated parents.",
              "Indeed, the relationship between parental education and children's achievement has remained relatively stable during the last fifty years, whereas the relationship between income and achievement has grown sharply.",

              "How do taxes affect income inequality?",
              "Because high-income households pay a larger share of their income in total federal taxes than low-income households, federal taxes reduce income inequality.",
              "But federal taxes have done little to offset increasing income inequality over the past 40 years.",
              "Income inequality has increased sharply over the past 40 years.",
              "A simple way to measure inequality is by looking at the share of income received by the highest-income people.",
              "Using a broad measure that includes labor, business, and capital income;",
              "and government social insurance benefits (such as Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance), the Congressional Budget Office finds that the fifth of the population with the highest income saw their share rise from 46 to 54 percent between 1979 and 2016 (figure 1).",
              "This increase in income inequality came about despite the growth in Social Security and Medicare, which boost before-tax income for low- and middle-income households.",
              "Much of the gain in the top income share went to the top 1 percent of the population.",
              "In 1979, they received 9 percent of all income.",
              "By 2016, their share grew to 16 percent, more than all the income received by the bottom 40 percent (figure 2).",
              "The income measure used in figures 1 and 2 includes realized capital gains, which are sensitive to business cycle fluctuations and to changes in tax rates.",
              "Because realized capital gains are a significant component of income for the top 1 percent, their income share is more volatile than that of other groups.",
              "Top income shares have not reached these levels since the 1920s (figure 3).",
              "After falling precipitously during the Great Depression and World War II, the income share of the top 1 percent leveled off during the next three decades.",
              "It began climbing again in the 1980s, interrupted only by the 2001 and 2008\u201309 recessions.",
              "Since the stock market rebound, income shares for the top 1 percent have increased again.",
              "The United States is not the only country with increasing income inequality.",
              "Most member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have experienced the same phenomenon, though to a lesser degree than the United States (figure 4).",

              "What happens after we account for taxes?",

              "High-income households pay a larger share of their income in total federal taxes than low-income households (figure 5).",
              "State and local taxes, which are not included in this analysis, are much less progressive and some, such as sales taxes, are regressive (low-income households pay a higher share of their income in sales taxes than high-income households).",
              "Because federal taxes are progressive, the distribution of after-tax income is more equal than income before taxes.",
              "High-income households have a slightly smaller share of total income after taxes than their share of income before taxes, while the reverse is true for other income groups (figure 6).",
              "Federal taxes are more progressive than they were 35 years ago.",
              "Although the average tax rate for high-income households has varied, it is now just below its peaks in 1979 and 1995.",
              "Meanwhile, the average tax rate for middle- and low-income groups dropped incrementally from the early 1980s through 2007 and then fell dramatically from 2007 through 2009 because of temporary tax cuts enacted in response to the Great Recession.",
              "Average rates rebounded as those tax cuts expired but, by 2016, rates remained well below their 1979 values for those groups (figure 7).",
              "A more progressive tax system would reduce income inequality if nothing else changes.",
              "But while federal taxes have become more progressive, they also began shrinking in 2001 relative to before-tax income, thanks to tax cuts during the George W.",
              "Bush and Barack Obama administrations.",
              "A lower average tax rate offset the equalizing effect of increased tax progressivity, leaving the effect of federal taxes on income inequality little changed.",
              "A widely-used measure of income inequality is the Gini index.",
              "The index has a value of zero when income is distributed equally across all income groups and a value of one when the highest income group receives all the income.",
              "By this measure, inequality has been consistently lower for after-tax income than for before-tax income (figure 8).",
              "The gap between the index for before-tax and after-tax incomes measures how much taxes reduce inequality.",
              "The bigger the difference, the more taxes equalize income.",
              "The gap narrowed during the 1980s as taxes relative to income fell more for high-income households than for low-income groups.",
              "But as federal taxes became more progressive starting in the 1990s, the gap between before-tax and after-tax income inequality widened.",
              "In percentage terms, it remains today at roughly the pre-1980 value.",
              "The bottom line is that before-tax income inequality has risen since the 1970s, despite an increase in government transfer payments.",
              "Because high-income people pay higher average tax rates than others, federal taxes reduce inequality.",
              "But the mitigating effect of taxes is about the same today as before 1980.",
              "Thus, after-tax income inequality has increased about as much as before-tax inequality.",

              "This has reduced opportunities for working people striving to get ahead and weakened our overall economy.",
              "Though the growth in inequality reflects a host of long-standing national and global economic trends that are largely outside state policymakers\u2019 control (see box below), state policy choices can make matters worse or improve them.",
              "For example, virtually all states collect more taxes from moderate- and lower-income families, as a share of their income, than high-income families (see Figure 1).",
              "This increases inequality by reducing after-tax incomes more deeply among low- and middle-income families than high-income families.",
              "The mechanisms by which state tax systems ask less of the wealthy than of poor and middle-income families have developed over time, often through closed-door negotiations resulting in special tax breaks that benefit a relative few.",
              "To reverse these trends, states should avoid actions \u2014 such as cutting income taxes or raising sales taxes \u2014 that worsen inequality by shifting taxes further to lower-income residents.",
              "Instead, they should ensure that high-income earners pay their share and lower-income earners don\u2019t face increased tax responsibility.",

              "Over the past 30 years, our nation\u2019s income has grown increasingly unequal.",
              "In 1979 the average income for a household in the richest 1 percent was about 10 times higher than the average income for a household in the middle 20 percent.",
              "By 2007 that ratio had almost tripled.",
              "The average household in the richest 1 percent was now earning nearly 30 times as much as those in the middle.",
              "Yet even as income inequality increased dramatically, the effect of the federal tax code on income distribution declined substantially.",
              "Because, on average, richer households pay more of their income in federal taxes than do middle- and low-income households, the \u201cafter-tax\u201d distribution of income is always somewhat more equitable than it was before federal taxes are taken into account.",
              "But the magnitude of this effect can vary quite a lot because policy changes make the tax code less or more progressive.",
              "From 1979 to 2007 there were a number of major tax changes, but the cumulative effect was to render the federal tax code less progressive and therefore less able to dampen income inequality.",
              "By one measure of inequality, the federal tax code in 2007 was about one-third less effective at reducing income inequality than it had been in 1979.",
              "This issue brief will examine the consequences of these changes to the federal tax code on the income distribution.",
              "It will begin with a review of several measures of income inequality.",
              "The second section will briefly explain why federal taxation has the effect of reducing income inequality.",
              "Next up is a close look at how changes in the tax code since 1979 have affected its impact on the after-tax income distribution.",
              "The final section will compare how some proposed changes to today\u2019s tax code would affect income inequality in the future.",
              "In order to measure the impact of the tax code on income inequality, it is important to understand how income inequality itself is measured.",
              "There are a variety of different ways to measure income inequality, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.",
              "Each metric, however, tells essentially the same story about income equality in the United States: We have relatively high levels of income inequality, income inequality has gotten worse over time, and the federal tax code can make a significant difference in income inequality.",
              "So let\u2019s look briefly at three different metrics for measuring income inequality.",
              "The most comprehensive and widely used measure of income inequality is the Gini index.",
              "This index (also known as the Gini coefficient, Gini ratio, or Gini score) essentially measures the difference between actual income distribution and a perfectly equitable distribution in which everyone makes the same amount.",
              "A perfectly equitable distribution of income scores a 0 on the Gini index, whereas the most unequal distribution, in which a single person makes all the income, scores a 1.",
              "According to the U.",
              "S.",
              "Census Bureau, the Gini index for the United States in 2010 was 0.",
              "469\u2014a score that high indicates we have a far more unequal society than most other advanced, developed countries.",
              "The Scandinavian countries are the most equal with Gini scores of around 0.",
              "25.",
              "But even compared to countries that are far more similar to us than Sweden or Norway, the United States is still an outlier.",
              "Canada, for example, has a Gini index of 0.",
              "321, and the United Kingdom\u2019s Gini index is 0.",
              "34.",
              "In fact, our Gini index is much closer to countries like Malaysia (0.",
              "462) and Uganda (0.",
              "443).",
              "(see Chart 1) Though the Gini index is the broadest and most widely used measure of income inequality, it does have the disadvantage of being rather technical.",
              "Saying that a country\u2019s Gini index is 0.",
              "469 does not have an intuitive meaning for most people.",
              "Saying that the average household among the richest 1 percent of households takes home nearly 30 times as much as the average household among the middle 20 percent, however, may be a clearer way of expressing the same thought.",
              "In 1979 the average income for a household in the richest 1 percent of households was $550,000 (in 2007 dollars) before federal taxes, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
              "That same year, the average household in the middle 20 percent of all households made $54,100.",
              "So three decades ago the average household in the top 1 percent made more than 10 times as much as the average household in the middle.",
              "In 2007 that ratio was all the way up to almost 30.",
              "The average household in the top 1 percent made almost $1.",
              "9 million in 2007, compared to the $64,000 made by the average household in the middle 20 percent.",
              "(see Chart 2) Fundamentally, income inequality is all about the relative concentration of income.",
              "If a rich few claim more and more of the total income then the distribution of income is necessarily very unequal.",
              "Indeed, the Gini index is calculated by looking at income concentration across the entire income spectrum.",
              "In a very equal society, the richest 1 percent of households would make close to 1 percent of the income, as would the poorest 1 percent of households, as would any other percentile.",
              "The Gini score is essentially a combination of all the differences all along the income scale between an income distribution that has no disproportionate concentration and reality.",
              "But we can take a shortcut by looking just at the top 1 percent.",
              "Synonymous with rising inequality is a growing concentration of income at the top.",
              "Therefore, we could also measure inequality by simply looking at the share of total income flowing to the top 1 percent.",
              "This is obviously a cruder measurement than the Gini index since the distribution of income among the bottom 99 percent doesn\u2019t factor in at all.",
              "But it turns out that looking just at the share of income flowing to the richest 1 percent will tell the same basic story as looking at the Gini index.",
              "In 1979 the top 1 percent claimed 9.",
              "3 percent of all the income.",
              "In 2007 they enjoyed 19.",
              "4 percent.",
              "(see Chart 3) If every household in the United States paid exactly the same share of their income in federal taxes\u2014if everyone\u2019s effective tax rate was the same\u2014then the distribution of income after federal taxes would be precisely identical to the distribution of income before taxes.",
              "The tax code only makes a difference to income inequality if households at different points on the income spectrum pay different effective tax rates.",
              "If the tax code asks higher-income households to pay, on average, higher taxes than middle- and low-income households then the post-tax incomes of rich households will be reduced by a greater amount than the post-tax incomes of those in the middle and at the bottom.",
              "This would result in an after-tax distribution of income that is more evenly spread than the pre-tax distribution.",
              "This means that the more progressive the tax code is, the more it will reduce inequality.",
              "The converse is also true.",
              "The closer the federal tax code comes to a pure \u201cflat tax\u201d with everyone paying the same effective rates, the less it will do to reduce income inequality.",
              "And of course it is also possible that the tax code could turn regressive, with higher-income households paying average effective tax rates below those of middle-and low-income households.",
              "In that case, the federal tax code would actually exacerbate income inequality.",
              "It is worth mentioning that this is precisely the effect of state and local taxes, which, as a whole, are regressive.",
              "Since at least 1979 the federal tax system has been progressive, with overall effective tax rates generally going up with household income.",
              "Some parts of the tax code are more progressive than others.",
              "The federal individual and corporate income taxes are progressive, whereas payroll taxes and excise taxes are not.",
              "But with all the pieces together, the federal system is progressive.",
              "In 2007, the most recent year for which we have historically comparable data, the richest 1 percent of households paid 29.",
              "5 percent of their income in federal taxes.",
              "The middle 20 percent of income earners paid 14.",
              "3 percent, and the poorest 20 percent paid 4 percent.",
              "As a result of this progressive structure, the after-tax income distribution was substantially more equal than the pre-tax distribution.",
              "Before federal taxes our Gini index for 2007 was 0.",
              "524.",
              "After taxes it was 0.",
              "489, a 7.",
              "2 percent reduction.",
              "The tax code has reduced income inequality, to varying degrees, every year since at least 1979.",
              "Before turning to how changes in tax policy over the past 30 years altered the magnitude of the code\u2019s impact on inequality, it should be noted that taxation is not the only way the federal government directly effects income inequality.",
              "Benefits such as Social Security or unemployment insurance help reduce income inequality.",
              "So too do programs that supply \u201cin-kind\u201d substitutes for income such as supplemental nutrition assistance or rental housing assistance to those in the middle and the bottom of the income spectrum.",
              "Together, these programs are known as \u201ctransfers.",
              "\u201d In fact, the entire suite of federal programs that \u201ctransfer\u201d income does significantly more to reduce income inequality than the tax code does.",
              "In 2007 the Gini index for U.",
              "S.",
              "household income distribution before this assistance was 0.",
              "59.",
              "Government assistance reduced it to 0.",
              "524, an 11.",
              "2 percent reduction.",
              "Though it is outside the scope of this analysis to discuss these government transfers in detail, suffice it to say that their impact on income inequality has declined over time.",
              "Since the late 1970s there have been many changes to the federal tax code.",
              "Some of those changes have been progressive, asking those at the top of the income pyramid to pay more or those in the middle and bottom to pay less.",
              "And some have been regressive changes, mostly in the form of large tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich.",
              "Not surprisingly, fluctuations in the effect of the federal tax system on income inequality track very closely to major policy changes in the federal tax code.",
              "In 1979 the Gini index for before-tax income inequality was 0.",
              "407.",
              "Before federal taxes the richest 1 percent claimed 9.",
              "3 percent of all pre-tax income.",
              "That year federal taxation reduced the Gini index by 11 percent to 0.",
              "367 and reduced the share of income flowing to the richest percentile by nearly a quarter to 7.",
              "5 percent.",
              "1979 is both the first year of reliable data and the high-water mark for income-inequality reduction through the federal tax code.",
              "In the early 1980s President Ronald Reagan spearheaded major tax cuts that primarily benefited those with higher incomes.",
              "The total federal effective tax rate for a household in the richest 1 percent declined from 37 percent in 1979 to less than 26 percent by 1986.",
              "Tax rates for everyone else barely moved at all.",
              "For those in the middle 20 percent of income, the effective federal tax rate in 1979 was 18.",
              "6 percent.",
              "Seven years later it was 18 percent.",
              "And taxes actually went up for households in the bottom 40 percent of income earners.",
              "The result was a tax code that asked far less from the rich\u2014even as it asked the same or more from everyone else.",
              "Consequently, the effect of the federal tax system on income inequality dropped sharply.",
              "Whereas in 1979 the after-tax income distribution was 11 percent more equitable than the pre-tax income distribution, in 1986 after-tax income was just 5 percent more equitable than pre-tax income.",
              "And whereas in 1979 the after-tax share of income claimed by the richest percentile was 24 percent below its pre-tax share, in 1986 the richest percentile\u2019s share of post-tax income was just 6 percent lower than its share of pre-tax income.",
              "If 1979 was the high-water mark for the tax code\u2019s effect on income inequality, 1986 was the low point.",
              "(see Chart 4) In 1986 Congress passed and President Reagan signed a comprehensive tax reform package that temporarily boosted the power of the federal tax system to reduce income inequality.",
              "The 1986 reforms lowered the top marginal tax rate but also removed or reformed a host of provisions that allowed rich households to reduce their tax bills, and raised the tax rate on investment income.",
              "The combined effect was an increase in the effective tax rate for the richest 1 percent from 25.",
              "5 percent in 1986 to 31.",
              "2 percent in 1987, and small tax cuts for the bottom 60 percent of households.",
              "With the rich paying more and the middle and poor paying less, the after-tax distribution of income was substantially more equitable than it had been before the tax reform.",
              "In 1986, before the reform was implemented, federal taxes reduced the Gini index by 5 percent.",
              "In 1987, after reform, federal taxes reduced the Gini score by 7 percent.",
              "The following years saw a slow erosion of the tax code\u2019s impact on inequality and by 1990 the tax code was bringing down the Gini index by about 6 percent\u2014lower than the 7 percent reduction in 1987 but still higher than the 5 percent reduction in 1986.",
              "In the first years of the 1990s, President George H.",
              "W.",
              "Bush and then President Bill Clinton signed major federal deficit-reduction packages into law.",
              "Both packages included tax increases, and one important component of each was an increase in the top marginal income tax rate.",
              "The Clinton tax increase also included additional Medicare taxes for higher-income individuals.",
              "Both packages served to boost the impact of the tax code on inequality.",
              "From 1990 to 1995 the reduction in inequality, as measured by the Gini index, grew from 6 percent to 8.",
              "5 percent.",
              "The other measures of income inequality actually show an even more marked change, especially after the 1993 tax increases.",
              "In 1992 the average before-tax income for someone in the top 1 percent was nearly 15.",
              "5 times greater than the average before-tax income for someone in the middle 20 percent, but was 13 times greater after federal taxation.",
              "In other words, using this measure, the 1992 tax code reduced inequality relative to the pre-tax distribution by about 19 percent.",
              "Two years later the tax code reduced inequality, using the same measure, by almost 29 percent.",
              "In fact if we measure inequality based on average income of the top 1 percent versus the middle, then federal taxes in 1995 and 1996 actually reduced income inequality just as much as the taxes of 1979.",
              "(see Chart 5) In 1997 President Clinton signed another budget package, but this one included a tax cut, not a tax hike.",
              "The major component of this tax cut was a reduction in rates for capital gains, or the income earned from investments as opposed to salaries.",
              "Though it also included some tax cuts for people in the middle and at the bottom of the income spectrum, the overall tax cut was regressive, meaning richer households benefited more than those poorer than them.",
              "Four years later, President George W.",
              "Bush enacted a much larger package of regressive tax cuts, and then did so again in 2003.",
              "The combined effect of all these tax cuts was a steady reduction in taxes paid by the richest households.",
              "In 1996 the richest 1 percent of households paid an average effective federal tax rate of 36 percent.",
              "By 2001 that rate was down to 32.",
              "8 percent, and by 2007 it was down to 29.",
              "5 percent.",
              "Predictably, as the tax rate for the rich dwindled, so too did the impact of the federal tax system on after-tax income inequality.",
              "Whereas in 1996, federal taxes reduced the Gini index by 9 percent, by 2007 that reduction was down to just more than 7 percent.",
              "The other measures of income inequality show a similar decline in effectiveness.",
              "Examining three decades\u2019 worth of tax law changes and the attendant consequences for the tax system\u2019s relationship to income inequality reveals something striking: The one thing that matters most in determining how effective the tax code will be at reducing income inequality is the effective tax rate for the richest 1 percent of households.",
              "Chart 6 compares the effective tax rate for the richest 1 percent of households since 1979 and the tax system\u2019s impact on inequality, as measured by the reduction in Gini scores, over the same time period.",
              "Mathematically, the two lines have a 92 percent correlation.",
              "In other words, when the effective tax rate for the rich goes up, so does the impact the tax code has on inequality, and vice versa.",
              "Looking at Chart 6, this relationship is immediately obvious.",
              "By contrast, another supposed metric of \u201cprogressivity,\u201d the share of taxes paid by the rich, has no relationship whatsoever to the tax code\u2019s impact on income inequality.",
              "Over the past three decades, the share of federal taxes paid by the richest 1 percent has consistently risen, while the impact of the federal tax code on inequality has fluctuated up and down.",
              "Some have suggested that this rise in the share of taxes paid by the rich proves the tax code has become more progressive.",
              "But of course the rise in share of taxes paid by the rich precisely mirrors the rise share of income going to the rich.",
              "Far from being a measure of progressivity, the share of taxes paid by the rich is actually an indirect measure of income inequality.",
              "On January 1, 2013, the Bush tax cuts are scheduled to expire.",
              "So too are a smaller package of tax cuts passed originally as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009.",
              "If all of these tax cuts are allowed to expire as scheduled, the entire tax code would all but reset to its state before President Bush took office.",
              "Given the impending \u201creset,\u201d Congress will certainly be forced to, at the very least, consider making some changes to the tax code.",
              "And though the menu of possible changes is infinite, there are two basic options for Congress to consider: Or: Using distributional estimates from the Tax Policy Center, we can calculate what each of these options would do to post-tax income inequality.",
              "Based on the Tax Policy Center\u2019s projections, the pre-tax income distribution in 2013 will have a Gini index of 0.",
              "494 (note that this Gini score is not comparable to the historical Gini scores because the Congressional Budget Office, which produced the historical data, uses a different definition of income than the Tax Policy Center does, and the Tax Policy Center data are categorized by tax unit rather than by household).",
              "The average income for the richest 1 percent will be nearly 35 times greater than the average income for someone in the middle 20 percent, and the richest 1 percent will claim 17.",
              "8 percent of all income.",
              "Based solely on the single criterion of reduction in after-tax income inequality, returning to the \u201cClinton tax code\u201d is clearly the superior of the two basic options.",
              "The Clinton tax code would reduce the Gini index by 9.",
              "4 percent, compared to an 8.",
              "6 percent reduction under the current tax code.",
              "The Clinton tax code would reduce the ratio of average incomes by 19.",
              "4 percent, compared to a 17 percent reduction under the current code.",
              "And the Clinton code would reduce the share of total income flowing to the richest 1 percent by about 13.",
              "5 percent, compared to an 11.",
              "8 percent reduction under current tax policies.",
              "In addition to these two basic options, there have been several proposals recently that would more dramatically alter the tax code.",
              "These include: The Center for American Progress also released a tax reform proposal as part of our comprehensive plan to balance the budget.",
              "And although we commissioned an outside consultant to conduct distributional analyses of our income tax reform, the Tax Policy Center did not evaluate our plan.",
              "Therefore, its impact on income inequality cannot be included in this analysis.",
              "Figure 7 shows the reduction in the after-tax Gini index achieved by each of the above tax proposals, along with the reduction achieved by the current tax code.",
              "Note that the Tax Policy Center\u2019s distributional analyses, on which these calculations are based, were conducted for different years depending on the plan.",
              "President Obama\u2019s proposals were evaluated for 2013.",
              "The proposals from Rep.",
              "Ryan and Bowles-Simpson were evaluated for 2015.",
              "The Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s plan was evaluated for 2021.",
              "These differing years of evaluation make direct comparisons slightly more problematic.",
              "But because the key metric is percent reduction in income inequality from the pre-tax distribution of income\u2014and not the relative levels of post-tax inequality under each tax plan\u2014we can still draw conclusions about the relative magnitude of each plan\u2019s effect on inequality.",
              "With that minor caveat in mind, it is nevertheless clear that the proposals from President Obama, Bowles-Simpson, and the Bipartisan Policy Center would improve the tax code\u2019s impact on income inequality compared to the current system, while the other two would dramatically reduce it.",
              "(see Chart 7) Given the historical relationship between the average effective tax rate for the richest 1 percent and the tax code\u2019s impact on income inequality, these results should not be too surprising.",

              "This wage subsidy encourages workers to enter the labor force and the minimum wage helps ensures they receive an adequate wage to escape poverty.",
              "Looking at the data, we can see how the minimum wage and the EITC work together to pull families out of poverty.",
              "At the current minimum-wage level, a single earner (full-time, full-year) with two dependents would receive $5,372 from the EITC for a total after-federal income of $20,452 (although workers may need to pay state income taxes and will owe payroll taxes).",
              "With a minimum wage of $9.",
              "45 in 2013 dollars, a single earner would see a $4,920 boost from the EITC for a total after-federal income tax of $24,576.",

              "According to UC-Berkeley economist Jesse Rothstein\u2019s estimates, employers capture 27 percent of the value of the EITC.",
              "The EITC induces more workers into the labor market and makes it easier for them more to take lower wages, since they can get the EITC subsidy.",
              "Part of this result is because EITC-eligible workers who can afford a lower wage compete against non-eligible workers.",
              "The result is that employers get labor at a cheaper rate than they would otherwise.",
              "One very important reason to focus on raising the minimum wage is that a higher minimum wage reduces this capture by reducing the reduction in wages caused by the increase in the supply of labor.",
              "Making more workers eligible for the EITC would also help benefit workers.",
              "The end result is both greater employment and more of the EITC subsidy going to the intended recipients, low-wage workers and their families.",
              "Low-wage workers are eligible for a variety of benefits aimed at boosting incomes or helping them afford basics, such as housing, health care, or childcare.",
              "This is important since many basics, especially health care, childcare, and housing, are too expensive at market rates for low-income workers and their families.",
              "Childcare alone can eat up a large portion of a minimum wage workers\u2019 income.",
              "It is imperative that these programs work in tandem and that Congress\u2014and state policymakers\u2014consider the interaction effects of changing any of these policies.",
              "In many cases, the states set the rules for program eligibility, with some guidelines from the federal government, so engaging them in this conversation is a must.",
              "In the mid-1990s when Congress implemented welfare reform, Congress did a very good job putting all these pieces together by looking at thebenefits and income supports for low-wage workers and their families as a package.",
              "Within a short span of time, Congress implemented welfare reform, while also raising the minimum wage, expanding the EITC, expanding access to children\u2019s health through the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and expanding childcare subsidies.",
              "Only by putting a full basket of policies together will low-wage workers be able to rise out of poverty and into the middle class.",
              "The minimum wage is a core piece of this puzzle, but it is not the only piece.",
              "(See Figure 2.)",
              "Congress could do more to ensure that minimum wage workers earn a fair day\u2019s pay by making sure that when they or their child gets sick they have the right to job-protected paid sick days, as proposed in the Healthy Families Act and is now the law in a number of municipalities and the state of Connecticut.",
              "Further, most minimum wage workers do not have the right to vacation time or paid family and medical leave, making it difficult for them to care for their families while working full-time.",
              "Raising the minimum wage is not only an effective anti-poverty tool but also a proven way to boost our economy more generally.",
              "The economics evidence shows that raising the minimum wage does not lead to higher unemployment overall but rather boosts productivity and addresses a growing issue in our economy of rising inequality.",

              "Economists David Card, of the University of California, Berkeley, and Alan Krueger, of Princeton University, looked at the effects of a minimum wage hike in New Jersey by comparing fast food restaurant employment in the state to fast food employment in Pennsylvania which did not increase its minimum wage.",

              "They too found that minimum wage did not have a significant effect on employment.",
              "One reason that employment has not been shown to fall due to raising the minimum wage is because higher wages can make workers more productive and therefore more valuable to their employer.",

              "In their survey, managers reported that they could identify possible non-wage savings and productivity improvements in response to the minimum-wage regulations.",
              "It is possible that lower costs stemming from these changes could outweigh the costs of paying a higher minimum wage.",
              "In addition, it\u2019s possible that a higher minimum wage could make staying in one\u2019s job more attractive and thus reduce turnover costs.",
              "A 2013 working paper by UMass-Amherst economist Arindrajit Dube, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill economist William Lester, and UC-Berkeley economist Michael Reich finds that a higher minimum wage leads to fewer so called \u201chires and separations,\u201d or worker turnover.",

              "Lower turnover costs could potentially allow businesses to overcome the increased cost of paying a higher wage.",
              "Finally, the level of the minimum wage has a considerable effect on the distribution of wages in the United States.",
              "As mentioned above, the minimum wage used to be much closer to the average wage.",
              "But since 1968, the average wage grew as the purchasing power of the minimum wage declined by 23 percent.",
              "At the same time, the distance between wage earner at the 10th percentile and median wage earner, or the earner at the 50th percentile, grew by 18 percent from 1979 to 2009.",
              "Economists have found that the declining inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage had a considerable effect on wage inequality for those workers in the bottom half of the wage distribution.",
              "A 1996 paper by economists John DiNardo, of the University of Michigan, Nicole Fortin, of the University of British Columbia, and Thomas Lemieux, also of the University of British Columbia, found that the decrease in the minimum wage from 1979 to 1988 had a considerable effect on the wage distribution.",
              "They found the decline over that time could explain up to 25 percent of the change in the standard deviation in the logarithm of male wages and up to 30 percent for female wages.",
              "In plain English, this means the decline in the minimum wage explained up to a fourth of increasing wage inequality for men and up to three-tenths of increase wage inequality for women.",
              "In more recent work, MIT economist David Autor, London School of Economics economist Alan Manning, and Federal Reserve Board economist Christopher Smith find that about 75 percent of the increase in low-end inequality from 1979 to 1991 is due to the decline in the value of the minimum wage, but the decline only explains 45 percent of the increase from 1979 to 2009.",
              "While the literature has not come to an agreement on the exact size of the effect, the decline of the minimum wage was a significant factor in the increase in inequality for lower half of the income distribution.",
