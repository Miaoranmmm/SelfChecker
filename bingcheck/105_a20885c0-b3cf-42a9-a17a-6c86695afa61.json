              "Translated into a variety of languages over a broad geographic range, the Diamond Su\u0304tra is one of the most influential Mahayana sutras in East Asia, and it is particularly prominent within the Chan (or Zen) tradition,[1] along with the Heart Sutra.",
              "A copy of the Tang dynasty\u2013Chinese version of the Diamond Su\u0304tra was found among the Dunhuang manuscripts in 1900 by Daoist monk Wang Yuanlu and sold to Aurel Stein in 1907.",
              "[2] They are dated back to 11 May 868.",
              "[3] It is, in the words of the British Library, \"the earliest dated printed book\".",
              "[4] It is also the first known creative work with an explicit public domain dedication, as its colophon at the end states that it was created \"for universal free distribution\".",
              "[5] The Sanskrit title for the su\u0304tra is the Vajracchedika\u0304 Prajn\u0303a\u0304pa\u0304ramita\u0304 Su\u0304tra, which may be translated roughly as the \"Vajra Cutter Perfection of Wisdom Su\u0304tra\" or \"The Perfection of Wisdom Text that Cuts Like a Thunderbolt\".",
              "[1] In English, shortened forms such as Diamond Su\u0304tra and Vajra Su\u0304tra are common.",
              "The title relies on the power of the vajra (diamond or thunderbolt, but also an abstract term for a powerful weapon) to cut things as a metaphor for the type of wisdom that cuts and shatters illusions to get to ultimate reality.",
              "[1] The sutra is also called by the name \"Tris\u0301atika\u0304 Prajn\u0303a\u0304pa\u0304ramita\u0304 Su\u0304tra\" (300 lines Perfection of Insight sutra).",
              "The Diamond Su\u0304tra is highly regarded in East Asian countries with traditions of Mahayana Buddhism.",
              "[1] Translations of this title into the languages of some of these countries include: The exact date of the composition of the Diamond Su\u0304tra in Sanskrit is uncertain\u2014arguments for the 2nd and 5th centuries have been made.",
              "[1] The first Chinese translation dates to the early 5th century, but, by this point, the 4th or 5th century monks Asanga and Vasubandhu seem to have already authored authoritative commentaries on its content.",
              "[1] The Vajracchedika sutra was an influential work in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition.",
              "Early translations into a number of languages have been found in locations across Central and East Asia, suggesting that the text was widely studied and translated.",
              "In addition to Chinese translations, translations of the text and commentaries were made into Tibetan, and translations, elaborations, and paraphrases survive in a number of Central Asian languages.",
              "[1] The first translation of the Diamond Su\u0304tra into Chinese is thought to have been made in 401 by the venerated and prolific translator Kuma\u0304raji\u0304va.",
              "[7] Kuma\u0304raji\u0304va's translation style is distinctive, possessing a flowing smoothness that reflects his prioritization on conveying the meaning as opposed to precise literal rendering.",
              "[8] The Kuma\u0304raji\u0304va translation has been particularly highly regarded over the centuries, and it is this version that appears on the 868 Dunhuang scroll.",
              "It is the most widely used and chanted Chinese version.",
              "[9] In addition to the Kuma\u0304raji\u0304va translation, a number of later translations exist.",
              "The Diamond Su\u0304tra was again translated from Sanskrit into Chinese by Bodhiruci in 509, Parama\u0304rtha in 558, Dharmagupta (twice, in 590 and in 605~616), Xuanzang (twice, in 648 and in 660~663), and Yijing in 703.",
              "[7] The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited a Maha\u0304sa\u0304m\u0323ghika-Lokottarava\u0304da monastery at Bamiyan, Afghanistan, in the 7th century.",
              "Using Xuanzang's travel accounts, modern archaeologists have identified the site of this monastery.",
              "[10] Birchbark manuscript fragments of several Maha\u0304ya\u0304na su\u0304tras have been discovered at the site, including the Vajracchedika\u0304 Prajn\u0303a\u0304pa\u0304ramita\u0304 Su\u0304tra (MS 2385), and these are now part of the Sch\u00f8yen Collection.",
              "[10] This manuscript was written in the Sanskrit language, and written in an ornate form of the Gupta script.",
              "[10] This same Sanskrit manuscript also contains the Medicine Buddha Su\u0304tra (Bhais\u0323ajyaguruvaid\u0323u\u0304ryaprabha\u0304ra\u0304ja Su\u0304tra).",
              "[10] The Diamond Su\u0304tra gave rise to a culture of artwork, su\u0304tra veneration, and commentaries in East Asian Buddhism.",
              "By the end of the Tang dynasty (907) in China there were over 80 commentaries written on it (only 32 survive), such as those by prominent Chinese Buddhists like Sengzhao, Xie Lingyun, Zhiyi, Jizang, Kuiji and Zongmi.",
              "[11][1] Copying and recitation of the Diamond Sutra was a widespread devotional practice, and stories attributing miraculous powers to these acts are recorded in Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, and Mongolian sources.",
              "[1] One of the best known commentaries is the Exegesis on the Diamond Sutra by Huineng, the Sixth Patriarch of the Chan School.",
              "[12] The Diamond Sutra features prominently in the 1st chapter of the Platform Sutra, the religious biography of Huineng, where hearing its recitation is supposed to have triggered the enlightening insight that led Huineng to abandon his life as a woodcutter to become a Buddhist monk.",
              "[1] The Vajracchedika\u0304 Prajn\u0303a\u0304pa\u0304ramita\u0304 Sutra contains the discourse of the Buddha to a senior monk, Subhuti.",
              "[13] Its major themes are anatman (not-self), the emptiness of all phenomena (though the term 's\u0301u\u0304nyata\u0304' itself does not appear in the text),[14] the liberation of all beings without attachment and the importance of spreading and teaching the Diamond Su\u0304tra itself.",
              "In his commentary on the Diamond Su\u0304tra, Hsing Yun describes the four main points from the su\u0304tra as giving without attachment to self, liberating beings without notions of self and other, living without attachment, and cultivating without attainment.",
              "[15] According to Shigenori Nagatomo, the major goal of the Diamond Su\u0304tra is: \"an existential project aiming at achieving and embodying a non-discriminatory basis for knowledge\" or \"the emancipation from the fundamental ignorance of not knowing how to experience reality as it is\".",
              "[16] In the su\u0304tra, the Buddha has finished his daily walk to Sravasti with the monks to gather offerings of food, and he sits down to rest.",
              "Elder Subhu\u0304ti comes forth and asks the Buddha: \"How, Lord, should one who has set out on the bodhisattva path take his stand, how should he proceed, how should he control the mind?\"",
              "[17] What follows is a dialogue regarding the nature of the \"perfection of insight\" (Prajn\u0303a\u0304pa\u0304ramita\u0304) and the nature of ultimate reality (which is illusory and empty).",
              "The Buddha begins by answering Subhuti by stating that he will bring all living beings to final nirvana, but that after this \"no living being whatsoever has been brought to extinction\".",
              "[17] This is because a bodhisattva does not see beings through reified concepts such as \"person\", \"soul\" or \"self\", but sees them through the lens of perfect understanding, as empty of inherent, unchanging self.",
              "The Buddha continues his exposition with similar statements which use negation to point out the emptiness of phenomena, merit, the Dharma (Buddha's teaching), the stages of enlightenment and the Buddha himself.",
              "Japanese Buddhologist Hajime Nakamura calls this negation the \"logic of not\" (na prthak).",
              "[16] Further examples of the Diamond Su\u0304tra's via negativa include statements such as:[17] The Buddha is generally thought to be trying to help Subhu\u0304ti unlearn his preconceived, limited notions of the nature of reality.",
              "Emphasizing that all phenomena are ultimately illusory, he teaches that true enlightenment cannot be grasped until one has set aside attachment to them in any form.",
              "[citation needed] Another reason why the Buddha makes use of negation is that language reifies concepts and this can lead to attachment to those concepts, but true wisdom is seeing that nothing is fixed or stable, hence according to the Diamond Su\u0304tra thoughts such as \"I have obtained the state of an Arhat\" or \"I will bring living beings to nirvana\" do not even occur in an enlightened one's mind because this would be \"seizing upon a self .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "seizing upon a living being, seizing upon a soul, seizing upon a person\".",
              "[17] The sutra goes on to state that anyone who says such things should not be called a bodhisattva.",
              "According to David Kalupahana the goal of the Diamond Su\u0304tra is \"one colossal attempt to avoid the extremist use of language, that is, to eliminate any ontological commitment to concepts while at the same time retaining their pragmatic value, so as not to render them totally empty of meaning\".",
              "[14] Kalupahana explains the negation of the Diamond Su\u0304tra by seeing an initial statement as an erroneous affirmation of substance or selfhood, which is then critiqued (\"'all dharmas' are dharmaless\"), and then finally reconstructed (\"that is why they are called 'all dharmas'\") as being conventional and dependently originated.",
              "Kalupahana explains this final reconstruction as meaning: \"that each concept, instead of either representing a unique entity or being an empty term, is a substitute for a human experience which is conditioned by a variety of factors.",
              "As such, it has pragmatic meaning and communicative power without being absolute in any way.\"",
              "[14] According to Paul Harrison, the Diamond Su\u0304tra's central argument here is that \"all dharmas lack a self or essence, or to put it in other words, they have no core ontologically, they only appear to exist separately and independently by the power of conventional language, even though they are in fact dependently originated\".",
              "[18] The mind of someone who practices the Prajn\u0303a\u0304pa\u0304ramita\u0304 or \"perfection of wisdom\" is then a mind free from fixed substantialist or \"self\" concepts: However, Lord, the idea of a self will not occur to them, nor will the idea of a living being, the idea of a soul, or the idea of a person occur.",
              "Why is that?",
              "Any such idea of a self is indeed idealess, any idea of a living being, idea of a soul, or idea of a person is indeed idealess.",
              "Why is that?",
              "Because the Buddhas and Lords are free of all ideas.",
              "[17] Throughout the teaching, the Buddha repeats that successful memorization and elucidation of even a four-line extract of it is of incalculable merit, better than giving an entire world system filled with gifts and can bring about enlightenment.",
              "Section 32 (of the Chinese version) also ends with a four-line gatha: All conditioned phenomena Are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow, Like dew or a flash of lightning;",
              "Thus we shall perceive them.",
              "[19] Paul Harrison's translation of the Sanskrit version states:[17] A shooting star, a clouding of the sight, a lamp, An illusion, a drop of dew, a bubble, A dream, a lightning's flash, a thunder cloud\u2014 This is the way one should see the conditioned.",
              "Red Pine's translation about life showed that the text read:[20] So you should view this fleeting world\u2014 A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream, A flash of lightning in a summer cloud, A flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream.",
              "There is a woodblock-printed copy of the Diamond Sutra in the British Library which, although not the earliest example of block printing, is the earliest example which bears an actual date.",
              "The extant copy is in the form of a scroll about five metres (16 ft) long.",
              "The archaeologist Sir Marc Aurel Stein purchased it in 1907 in the walled-up Mogao Caves near Dunhuang in northwest China from a monk guarding the caves \u2013 known as the \"Caves of the Thousand Buddhas\".",
              "The colophon, at the inner end, reads: Reverently made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 15th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [11 May 868].",
              "[clarification needed] In 2010 UK writer and historian Frances Wood, head of the Chinese section at the British Library, Mark Barnard, conservator at the British Library, and Ken Seddon, professor of chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast, were involved in the restoration of its copy of the book.",

              "The Diamond Sutra, a Sanskrit text translated into Chinese, was one of 40,000 scrolls and documents hidden in \u201cThe Cave of a Thousand Buddhas,\u201d a secret library sealed up around the year 1,000 when the area was threatened by a neighboring kingdom.",

              "Indeed, even the promulgation of Hangeul was done through woodblock prints.",
              "The general assumption is that movable type did not replace block printing in places that used Chinese characters due to the expense of producing more than 200,000 individual pieces of type.",

              "[53] And unlike China, the movable type system was kept mainly within the confines of a highly stratified elite Korean society: Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty.",
              "Royalty kept a monopoly of this new technique and by royal mandate suppressed all non-official printing activities and any budding attempts at commercialization of printing.",

              "Saga Books were printed on expensive paper, and used various embellishments, being printed specifically for a small circle of literary connoisseurs.",
              "[57] For aesthetic reasons, the typeface of the Saga-bon, like that of traditional handwritten books, adopted the renmen-tai (ja), in which several characters are written in succession with smooth brush strokes.",

              "[27][62] In countries using Arabic scripts, works, especially the Qur'an were printed from blocks or by lithography in the 19th century, as the links between the characters require compromises when movable type is used which were considered inappropriate for sacred texts.",

              "[12] The Diamond Sutra features prominently in the 1st chapter of the Platform Sutra, the religious biography of Huineng, where hearing its recitation is supposed to have triggered the enlightening insight that led Huineng to abandon his life as a woodcutter to become a Buddhist monk.",

              "[13] Its major themes are anatman (not-self), the emptiness of all phenomena (though the term 's\u0301u\u0304nyata\u0304' itself does not appear in the text),[14] the liberation of all beings without attachment and the importance of spreading and teaching the Diamond Su\u0304tra itself.",
              "In his commentary on the Diamond Su\u0304tra, Hsing Yun describes the four main points from the su\u0304tra as giving without attachment to self, liberating beings without notions of self and other, living without attachment, and cultivating without attainment.",
              "[15] According to Shigenori Nagatomo, the major goal of the Diamond Su\u0304tra is: \"an existential project aiming at achieving and embodying a non-discriminatory basis for knowledge\" or \"the emancipation from the fundamental ignorance of not knowing how to experience reality as it is\".",
              "[16] In the su\u0304tra, the Buddha has finished his daily walk to Sravasti with the monks to gather offerings of food, and he sits down to rest.",
              "Elder Subhu\u0304ti comes forth and asks the Buddha: \"How, Lord, should one who has set out on the bodhisattva path take his stand, how should he proceed, how should he control the mind?\"",
              "[17] What follows is a dialogue regarding the nature of the \"perfection of insight\" (Prajn\u0303a\u0304pa\u0304ramita\u0304) and the nature of ultimate reality (which is illusory and empty).",
              "The Buddha begins by answering Subhuti by stating that he will bring all living beings to final nirvana, but that after this \"no living being whatsoever has been brought to extinction\".",
              "[17] This is because a bodhisattva does not see beings through reified concepts such as \"person\", \"soul\" or \"self\", but sees them through the lens of perfect understanding, as empty of inherent, unchanging self.",
              "The Buddha continues his exposition with similar statements which use negation to point out the emptiness of phenomena, merit, the Dharma (Buddha's teaching), the stages of enlightenment and the Buddha himself.",
              "Japanese Buddhologist Hajime Nakamura calls this negation the \"logic of not\" (na prthak).",
              "[16] Further examples of the Diamond Su\u0304tra's via negativa include statements such as:[17] The Buddha is generally thought to be trying to help Subhu\u0304ti unlearn his preconceived, limited notions of the nature of reality.",
              "Emphasizing that all phenomena are ultimately illusory, he teaches that true enlightenment cannot be grasped until one has set aside attachment to them in any form.",
              "[citation needed] Another reason why the Buddha makes use of negation is that language reifies concepts and this can lead to attachment to those concepts, but true wisdom is seeing that nothing is fixed or stable, hence according to the Diamond Su\u0304tra thoughts such as \"I have obtained the state of an Arhat\" or \"I will bring living beings to nirvana\" do not even occur in an enlightened one's mind because this would be \"seizing upon a self .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "seizing upon a living being, seizing upon a soul, seizing upon a person\".",
              "[17] The sutra goes on to state that anyone who says such things should not be called a bodhisattva.",
              "According to David Kalupahana the goal of the Diamond Su\u0304tra is \"one colossal attempt to avoid the extremist use of language, that is, to eliminate any ontological commitment to concepts while at the same time retaining their pragmatic value, so as not to render them totally empty of meaning\".",
              "[14] Kalupahana explains the negation of the Diamond Su\u0304tra by seeing an initial statement as an erroneous affirmation of substance or selfhood, which is then critiqued (\"'all dharmas' are dharmaless\"), and then finally reconstructed (\"that is why they are called 'all dharmas'\") as being conventional and dependently originated.",
              "Kalupahana explains this final reconstruction as meaning: \"that each concept, instead of either representing a unique entity or being an empty term, is a substitute for a human experience which is conditioned by a variety of factors.",
              "As such, it has pragmatic meaning and communicative power without being absolute in any way.\"",
              "[14] According to Paul Harrison, the Diamond Su\u0304tra's central argument here is that \"all dharmas lack a self or essence, or to put it in other words, they have no core ontologically, they only appear to exist separately and independently by the power of conventional language, even though they are in fact dependently originated\".",
              "[18] The mind of someone who practices the Prajn\u0303a\u0304pa\u0304ramita\u0304 or \"perfection of wisdom\" is then a mind free from fixed substantialist or \"self\" concepts: However, Lord, the idea of a self will not occur to them, nor will the idea of a living being, the idea of a soul, or the idea of a person occur.",
              "Why is that?",

              "But if you were to ask ten dharma teachers what it is about, you might get ten different answers, because the Diamond defies literal interpretation.",
              "The sutra's title in Sanskrit, Vajracchedika Prajnaparamita Sutra, could be very roughly translated as the \"diamond-cutting perfection of wisdom sutra.\"",
              "Thich Nhat Hanh says the title means \"the diamond that cuts through afflictions, ignorance, illusion, or delusion.\"",
              "It is also sometimes called the Diamond Cutter Sutra, or the Vajra Sutra.",
              "The Diamond is part a large canon of early Mahayana sutras called the Prajnaparamita Sutras.",
              "Prajnaparamita means \"perfection of wisdom.\"",
              "In Mahayana Buddhism, the perfection of wisdom is the realization or direct experience of sunyata (emptiness).",

              "Sometimes these sutras are referred to as the \"prajna\" or \"wisdom\" literature.",
              "Mahayana Buddhist legend says that the Prajnaparamita Sutras were dictated by the historical Buddha to various disciples.",
              "They were then hidden for about 500 years and only discovered when people were ready to learn from them.",
              "However, scholars believe they were written in India beginning in the 1st century BCE and continuing for a few more centuries.",
              "For the most part, the oldest surviving versions of these texts are Chinese translations that date from the early first millennium CE.",
              "The several texts of the Prajnaparamita Sutras vary from very long to very short and are often named according to the number of lines it takes to write them.",
              "So, one is the Perfection of Wisdom in 25,000 Lines.",
              "Another is the Perfection of Wisdom in 20,000 Lines, and then 8,000 lines, and so on.",
              "The Diamond is The Perfection of Wisdom in 300 Lines.",
              "It is often taught within Buddhism that the shorter Prajnaparamita sutras are distillations of the longer ones and that the brief and highly distilled Diamond and Heart sutras were written last.",
              "But many scholars suspect the shorter sutras are the older ones, and the longer sutras are elaborations.",
              "Scholars believe the original text of the Diamond Sutra was written in India some time in the 2nd century CE.",
              "Kumarajiva is believed to have made the first translation into Chinese in 401 CE, and the Kumarajiva text seems to be the one most often translated into English.",
              "Prince Chao-Ming (501-531), a son of Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty, divided the Diamond Sutra into 32 chapters and gave each chapter a title.",
              "This chapter division has been preserved to this day, although translators do not always use Prince Chao-Ming's titles.",
              "The Diamond Sutra played an important role in the life of Huineng (638-713), the Sixth Patriarch of Chan (Zen).",
              "It is recorded in Huineng's autobiography that when he was an adolescent selling firewood in a marketplace, he heard someone reciting the Diamond Sutra and immediately became enlightened.",
              "It is believed the Diamond Sutra was translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan in the late 8th or early 9th century.",
              "The translation is attributed to a disciple of Padmasambhava named Yeshe De and an Indian scholar named Silendrabodhi.",
              "An even older manuscript of the Diamond Sutra was discovered in the ruins of a Buddhist monastery in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, written in a language of Gandhara.",
              "A complete woodblock printed scroll of the Diamond Sutra, dated 868 CE, was among several texts preserved in a sealed cave near Dunhuang, in Gansu Province, China.",
              "In 1900 a Chinese monk, Abbot Wang Yuanlu, discovered the sealed door to the cave, and in 1907 a Hungarian-British explorer named Marc Aurel Stein was allowed to see inside the cave.",
              "Stein chose some scrolls randomly and purchased them from Abbot Wang.",
              "Eventually, these scrolls were taken to London and given to the British Library.",
              "It would be a few years before European scholars recognized the significance of the Diamond Sutra scroll and realized how old it was.",
              "It was printed nearly 600 years before Gutenberg printed his first Bible.",
              "The text describes the Buddha dwelling in Anathapindika's grove with 1,250 monks.",
              "Most of the text takes the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and a disciple named Subhuti.",
              "There is a common view that the Diamond Sutra primarily is about impermanence.",
              "This is because of a short verse in the last chapter that seems to be about impermanence and which often is mistaken as an explanation of the 31 enigmatic chapters that preceded it.",
              "To say that the Diamond Sutra is only about impermanence, however, does not do it justice.",
              "The verses in the Diamond Sutra address the nature of reality and the activity of bodhisattvas.",
              "Throughout the sutra, the Buddha instructs us to not be bound by concepts, even concepts of \"Buddha\" and \"dharma.\"",
              "This is a deep and subtle text, not meant to be read like a textbook or instruction manual.",
              "Although Huineng may have realized enlightenment when he first heard the sutra, other great teachers have said the text revealed itself to them slowly.",
              "The late John Daido Loori Roshi said that when he first tried to read the Diamond Sutra, \"It drove me crazy.",
              "Then I started to read it the way the translator suggested it, a little at a time, not trying to understand it, just reading it.",
              "I did that for about two years.",
              "Every night before I went to bed I would read one section.",
