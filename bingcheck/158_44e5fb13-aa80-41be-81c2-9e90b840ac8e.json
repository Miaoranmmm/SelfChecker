              "Epigenetics is the study of heritable and stable changes in gene expression that occur through alterations in the chromosome rather than in the DNA sequence.",
              "[1] Despite not directly altering the DNA sequence, epigenetic mechanisms can regulate gene expression through chemical modifications of DNA bases and changes to the chromosomal superstructure in which DNA is packaged.",
              "Briefly, negatively charged DNA is packaged around a positively charged histone protein octamer, which contains 2 copies of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.",
              "[2] This nucleoprotein complex is a nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin.",
              "[3] The nucleosomes of a continuous DNA polymer are connected by linker DNA and the complex is stabilized by histone protein H1.",
              "The aggregation of chromatin results in the formation of a chromosome.",
              "The chromatin of a chromosome exists as either loose, transcriptionally active euchromatin or dense, transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.",
              "[4] Chemical alterations to histone proteins can induce the formation of either the open euchromatin state, which facilitates gene expression by allowing transcription factors and enzymes to interact with the DNA, or the closed heterochromatin state, which suppresses gene expression by preventing initiation of transcription.",
              "In addition to histone changes, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism associated with gene silencing when the methylation occurs in CpG islands of promoter sequences.",
              "[5] Further, non-coding RNA sequences have shown to play a key role in the regulation of gene expression.",
              "[6] These epigenetic modifications can be induced by several factors including age, diet, smoking, stress, and disease state.",
              "[7][8] Epigenetic modifications are reversible, but they rarely remain through generations in humans despite persisting through multiple cycles of cell replication.",
              "[9] Epigenetic mechanisms form a layer of control within a cell that regulates gene expression and silencing.",
              "This control varies between tissues and plays an important role in cell differentiation.",
              "[10] Additionally, differences in gene expression between cells, which are driven by epigenetic modifications, result in the unique function of specific cell types.",
              "[11] Genome-wide patterns of DNA and histone modifications are established during early development and are maintained throughout multiple cell divisions.",
              "In cancer, the normal epigenetic patterns are disrupted resulting in the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes like CDKN2A.",
              "[12] Three different epigenetic mechanisms have been identified: DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing.",
              "Catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes, DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group directly to a cytosine nucleotide within a cytosine-guanine sequence (CpG), which are often surrounded by other CpG\u2019s forming a CpG island.",
              "CpG islands are common targets for epigenetic DNA methylation, notably the CpG islands within promoter regions.",
              "Indeed, it has been reported that around 70% of gene promotor regions lie within CpG islands.",
              "[13] Methylated cytosines within a promoter region recruit gene suppressor proteins and reduce interaction between the DNA and transcription factors.",
              "[14] Cytosine methylation also drives the formation of heterochromatin, so the nucleosome tightening prevents transcriptional machinery from interacting with the DNA.",
              "[15] As such, DNA methylation within promoter regions results in gene silencing.",
              "Cancers often show marked hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of proto-oncogenes, both of which contribute to tumor carcinogenesis.",
              "[15] This epigenetic mechanism also plays an important role in tissue-specific gene regulation, genomic imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation.",
              "[14] The second epigenetic mechanism is post-translational modifications to histone proteins.",
              "These modifications include enzyme-catalyzed acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, each of which alters the DNA-histone interactions in nucleosomes.",
              "[16] Histone acetylation often occurs at positively charged lysine residues which weakens the DNA-histone interactions, thus opening the chromatin and facilitating transcription.",
              "[17] For example, acetylation of lysine 9 and lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac, respectively) correlates with transcription activation.",
              "Histone methylation is more complex as it does not change the histone protein charge and can include the addition of 1-3 methyl groups to lysine and 1-2 methyl groups to arginine.",
              "[17] For example, methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me) is associated with transcription activation while trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) correlates with transcription repression.",
              "[18] Histone phosphorylation involves the addition of a negative phosphate group to the histone tail, but less is known of its function aside from phosphorylation of H2A(X) playing a role in the response to DNA damage and its subsequent repair.",
              "[19] Histone ubiquitylation involves the addition of a large ubiquitin molecule to lysine residues.",
              "Examples of histone ubiquitylation include H2AK119ub, which is associated with gene silencing, and H2BK123ub, which is involved in transcription.",
              "[17] Aside from the relatively straightforward effect of histone acetylation on gene expression, the effects of other histone modifications are complex and greatly influenced by the state of nearby DNA molecules.",
              "The most recently elucidated epigenetic mechanism is non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing.",
              "A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is transcribed but not translated into proteins.",
              "Once regarded as waste of the genome, recent insight suggests the ncRNA molecules harbor a crucial role in epigenetic gene expression and likely account for the great difference in phenotype between species and within human populations despite such similarity in encoded proteins.",
              "[6][18] Notable ncRNA molecules include microRNAs (miRNA) and short interfering RNAs (siRNA), which include less than 30 nucleotides, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which are 200 nucleotides or longer.",
              "Though the full extent of their role in epigenetics is still being determined, there is evidence suggesting that ncRNAs participate in DNA methylation and histone modifications in addition to gene silencing.",
              "[20] siRNAs and lncRNAs both have been shown to regulate gene expression by the formation of heterochromatin.",
              "[6][21] As people age, the largest influence on the epigenome is the environment.",
              "Direct influencers such as diet can affect one's epigenome, as determined by the Dutch famine studies.",
              "[22][23] Other environmental stressors include smoking and psychological stress.",
              "Epigenetic changes in utero are particularly sensitive as the epigenetic profile of the fetus is forming and developing rapidly during this time.",
              "[24] Indeed, teratogens like cigarette smoke, alcohol, and specific minerals have shown to induce in utero epigenetic changes.",
              "[24][25] Perhaps the most studied clinical application of epigenetic mechanisms is cancer.",
              "One of the first reports of epigenetics involved in cancer reported hypomethylation of DNA in cancer cell genomes, which caused overexpression of genes within that cell.",
              "[26] Since this report, great strides have been made toward understanding the role of epigenetics in carcinogenesis.",
              "For example, the degree of DNA methylation continues to decrease as a benign tumor cell progresses to invasive cancer.",
              "[27] Other studies have shown hypomethylation of pro-proliferative genes like BAX2 that are suppressed in normal cells.",
              "[28] Other reports show hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, like Rb, BCRA1, and CDKN2A, in cancer cells.",
              "[29][30][31] Despite the wealth of knowledge present on the relationship between epigenetics and carcinogenesis, treatment development is still very much in the preliminary phase for most cancers.",
              "Epigenetics is a promising field of research because of the potential to regulate gene expression without changing the DNA sequence, which may likely cause safety and ethical concerns if performed in humans.",
              "The most promising way to treat diseases through epigenetic regulation has been through pharmacology.",
              "Previous clinical trials for drugs formulated to block epigenetic modifications associated with cancers have proved successful.",
              "The FDA has approved a number of these drugs which target epigenetic regulators to treat various cancers including azacytidine and decitabine for myelodysplastic syndrome, panobinostat for multiple myeloma, and romidepsin for cutaneous T cell lymphoma.",
              "[32] More drugs are likely to be approved in the coming years as a number of clinical trials for DNA methylation inhibitors and histone modification inhibitors are underway.",
              "In addition to cancers, many conditions associated with genomic imprinting are the result of malfunctioning epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms can induce disease, but they are also necessary for normal cell function, specifically in imprinted genes where only one parental chromosome is expressed.",
              "For genomic imprinting to successfully occur, the other parental chromosome must be silenced, which occurs through DNA methylation.",
              "Noteworthy conditions associated with abnormalities in gene imprinting include Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, and Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome.",
              "[33][34] Recent studies have shown positive results for epigenetic-based therapies for imprinting disorders, which may be a field of increased focus in the coming years in search of better treatments.",

              "As highlighted by the large offspring syndrome with in vitro conceived ovine and bovine animals, any disturbance during germ cell development or early embryogenesis has the potential to alter epigenetic reprogramming.",
              "Therefore the complete array of human assisted reproductive technology (ART), starting from ovarian hormonal stimulation to embryo uterine transfer, could have a profound impact on the epigenetic state of human in vitro produced individuals.",

              "To date, multiple reasons can be hypothesized why irrefutable epigenetic alterations as a result of ART have not been demonstrated yet.",
              "Conrad Waddington introduced the term epigenetics in the early 1940s.",
              "1 He defined epigenetics as \u2018\u2018the branch of biology which studies the causal interactions between genes and their products which bring the phenotype into being.",
              "\u2019\u20192 In the original sense of this definition, epigenetics referred to all molecular pathways modulating the expression of a genotype into a particular phenotype.",
              "Over the following years, with the rapid growth of genetics, the meaning of the word has gradually narrowed.",
              "Epigenetics has been defined and today is generally accepted as \u2018\u2018the study of changes in gene function that are mitotically and/or meiotically heritable and that do not entail a change in DNA sequence.",
              "\u2019\u20193 The epigenetic modifications described in current literature generally comprise histone variants, posttranslational modifications of amino acids on the amino-terminal tail of histones, and covalent modifications of DNA bases.",
              "The validity of the current definition of epigenetics should be seriously questioned because the previously mentioned epigenetic modifications also have a crucial role in the silencing and expression of noncoding sequences.",
              "In addition to their importance in the commitment of cells to a particular mitotically inheritable form or function, epigenetic marks have a crucial role in guaranteeing genomic stability.",
              "Indeed, the silencing of centromeres, telomeres, and transposable elements (TEs) ensures the correct attachment of microtubules to centromeres, reduces excessive recombination between repetitive elements, and prevents transposition of TEs and resulting insertional mutagenesis.",
              "4\u20136 Although covalent modifications of DNA bases have been described since 1948,7 it was only in 1969 that Griffith and Mahler suggested that these modifications may modulate gene expression.",
              "8 The predominant modification in mammalian DNA is methylation of cytosine,7 followed by adenine and guanine methylation.",
              "7,9 Although methylation of cytosine bases in mammalian DNA has been primarily described in the context of CpG dinucleotides,10 evidence suggests that cytosines in non-CpG sequences are also frequently methylated.",
              "11\u201313 Because the promoter regions of silenced genes possess significantly more methylated cytosines in comparison with actively transcribed genes, this modification has been implicated in transcriptional repression.",
              "14,15 Methylation of cytosine in the promoter region may repress gene expression by preventing the binding of specific transcription factors16 or may attract mediators of chromatin remodeling, such as histone-modifying enzymes or other repressors of gene expression.",
              "17\u201320 In mammals, the mitotic inheritance of methylated DNA bases is primarily ensured by a maintenance of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1),21\u201323 whereas DNA methylation enzymes DNMT3A and DNMT3B are mainly responsible for de novo methylation of unmethylated sites.",
              "24 Various studies have shown that DNMT3A and DNMT3B target different sites for methylation depending on the cell type and the stage of development.",
              "6,25,26 De novo methyltransferases may be directly targeted to specific DNA sequences, may necessitate the interaction with other DNA binding proteins or may be guided by RNA interference (RNAi) in a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM).",
              "27 Besides covalent modifications of DNA, histones and their posttranslational modifications have also been implicated in the organization of chromatin structure and regulation of gene transcription.",
              "Generally, histone classifications comprise the main histones or their variants H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.",
              "28\u201331 The fundamental building block of chromatin is the nucleosome and consists of DNA spooled around an octamer of histones.",
              "Each octamer contains two units of each principal or variant histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.",
              "32 Linker DNA connecting nucleosomes associates with the main form or variants of the linker histone H1.",
              "A variety of histone-modifying enzymes is responsible for a multiplicity of posttranslational modifications on specific serine, lysine, and arginine residues on the amino-terminal tail of these histones.",
              "33,34 The correlation of specific posttranslational modifications on the histones with transcriptional events has resulted in the histone code hypothesis.",
              "35 To date, the best characterized modifications are acetylations and methylations of lysine residues on histones H3 and H4.",
              "Although all acetylations of lysine residues on H3 and H4 have been associated with transcriptional activation (H3K9, H3K14, H3K18, H3K23, H4K5, H4K8, H4K12, and H4K16),36\u201341 methylation of lysine residues may be either associated with transcriptional repression (H3K9, H3K27, and H4K20) or activation (H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79) depending on which amino acid and to what extent (monomethylation, dimethylation, or trimethylation) the residue is modi-fied.",
              "41 Although not as well documented, it has become clear that posttranslational modifications of other histones also have an important role in chromatin structure and gene regulation.",
              "Indeed, more recently it has been reported that mutations on specific sites of histones H2A and H2B modify the transcription of various genes.",
              "42,43 Similarly, as for DNA methylation enzymes, histone-modifying enzymes may be targeted to specific DNA sequences directly19,20 or may necessitate the interaction of intermediates such as Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins and/or RNAi.",
              "44\u201347 In contrast to DNA methylation, it is unclear how and if histone modifications are correctly replicated during mitosis.",
              "Although a few investigators have claimed that histone complexes are distributed semiconservatively over the replicated genome,48 most researchers have refuted this manner of histone deposition.",
              "49 As a result, it should be questioned whether covalent histone modifications and histone variants are epigenetic marks according to the current definition of epigenetics.",
              "During evolution, an alteration or acquisition of a sex-determining gene on one copy of a pair of chromosomes has resulted in the emergence of sex chromosomes.",
              "Consequently, the sexes are generally determined by the presence of a hetero- or homomorphic pair of allosomes.",
              "With time, as a result of reduced recombination events between these heteromorphic chromosomes, vastly dissimilar sex chromosomes have arisen.",
              "This dissimilarity between the allosomes is at the origin of a gene dosage inequality between the two different sexes.",
              "50 To remediate to this imbalance, many species have adopted gene dosage compensation mechanisms. The epigenetic gene dosage compensation mechanisms of genes located on the sex chromosomes vary with species, from simple transcriptional modulation to the entire silencing of one allosome.",
              "51 Although it is generally accepted that therian mammals (placentals and marsupials) equalize X-chromosome gene dosage between the sexes by inactivating one X chromosome in females, it has also been suggested that transcription from the active X chromosome is upregulated to maintain balance between autosomal and allosomal gene expression.",
              "52 Initially, the observation that female mice heterozygous for X-chromosome-linked coat color genes displayed a mosaic phenotype led to Mary Lyon\u2019s hypothesis that either the paternally or maternally derived X chromosome could be inactivated in female animals.",
              "53 Later investigations revealed that this pattern of X-chromosome inactivation may differ depending on the species and the developmental status of the conceptus.",
              "Indeed, female offspring from placentals always possess a mixture of cells with an inactive X chromosome from either maternal or paternal origin, whereas marsupial offspring only present inactive X chromosomes from paternal origin.",
              "54,55 In addition, though random X-chromosome inactivation is reported in embryonic lineages from mouse postimplantation embryos, the paternally inherited X-chromosome is always preferentially silenced in preimplantation embryos56 and the resulting extraembryonic lineages.",
              "57 This latter form of X-chromosome inactivation is commonly referred to as imprinted X-chromosome inactivation.",
              "Although the ultimate outcome of both random and imprinted X-chromosome inactivation is the silencing of one X chromosome, studies suggest that the maintenance of epigenetic marks on the inactive X chromosome is markedly determined by whether the X chromosome underwent random or imprinted inactivation.",
              "Indeed, the silencing of imprinted inactive X chromosomes mainly depends on histone modifications applied by Polycomb proteins rather than DNA methylation, whereas DNA methylation is a crucial factor for the maintenance of the inactive state of randomly inactivated X chromosomes.",
              "58,59 To date no conclusive evidence exists for imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in human conceptuses.",
              "50 To permit random X-chromosome inactivation in the embryonic lineage of mice, a reactivation of the initially silenced X chromosome is necessary.",
              "Random X-chromosome inactivation is controlled by a region on the X chromosome called the X inactivation center (XIC).",
              "The XIC possesses the genes Xist and Tsix, which contain noncoding RNAs that are crucial for inactivating and maintaining activity of specific X chromosomes.",
              "Indeed, transcription of Xist on the inactive X chromosome mediates its silencing, whereas Tsix transcription from the active X chromosome prevents its inactivation.",
              "60 Although it remains unknown how X chromosomes are randomly selected for activity or inactivity, three mechanisms have been proposed for the selective silencing of the paternally derived X chromosome during early fetal development.",
              "Conceptually, the paternal X chromosome can enter the oocyte in a preinactivated condition or may be selectively silenced after fertilization.",
              "51 Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) during spermatogenesis supports the view that the paternal X chromosome can be inherited in an inactive state.",
              "61 However, it has also been claimed that MSCI is not crucial for imprinted X-chromosome inactivation because autosomes that do not undergo MSCI, but present Xist transgenes, are also preferentially silenced when paternally inherited.",
              "62 In opposition to the inheritance of a preinactivated X chromosome, the differential remodeling of the paternal and maternal chromatin and/or the translation of specific parental imprints on the X chromosomes after fertilization may be at the origin of the initial selective inactivation of the paternal X chromosome in female embryos.",
              "Indeed, Xist transcription may be instigated on the paternally derived X-chromosome as a result of the exchange of protamines in the paternal pronucleus with histone variants favoring transcription.",
              "63 Alternatively, imprinted X-chromosome inactivation has also been shown to be dependent on various differential epigenetic imprints on Xist and Tsix genes acquired during male and female germ cell development.",
              "64,65 In brief, X-chromosome inactivation in mammals has originated to compensate a gene dosage inequality between the two different sexes.",
              "Because of its necessity, the establishment and maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation seems to be controlled by a variety of redundant epigenetic marks and mechanisms. Pronuclear transfer experiments in the early 1980s revealed that mammalian reproduction necessitates the contribution of a paternal and maternal genome to be successful.",
              "66,67 The preferential mono-allelic expression of specific genes from either the maternal or paternal allele was believed to be at the origin of this phenomenon.",
              "The first imprinted genes in mammals were identified in the early 1990s.",
              "68\u201370 Genomic imprinting has been observed in angiosperms and mammals and would have independently evolved in these two taxa as a result of selective pressure on specific genes.",
              "71 Although many genes remain imprinted throughout the entire life of an organism, some genes are imprinted in a tissue-specific or temporal manner, similarly to the Xist gene.",
              "Imprinted genes are organized in clusters or domains, and their expression is under control of a cis-acting imprinting control element (ICE).",
              "72 Similarly to the XIC region on the X chromosome, ICE elements on autosomes acquire differential imprints during germ cell development, depending on their parental origin.",
              "Like X-chromosome imprints, autosomal imprints in female mammals are established during folliculogenesis, whereas imprints in males are reset during fetal development.",
              "73\u201378 The fact that the imprinted inactivation of the paternal X chromosome and autosomal genes present many molecular similarities has led to the hypothesis that these phenomena have coevolved.",
              "79 Although the maintenance, as well as the erasure, of acquired epigenetic marks between generations has both beneficial and deleterious effects, it is unknown to what extent epigenetic marks are maintained or erased between generations in mammals.",
              "Because primordial germ cells are set aside during mammalian fetal development and because of epigenetic reprogramming events during germ cell development and early embryogenesis, acquired epigenetic states are believed to be rarely passed on to progeny.",
              "80 The erasure of epigenetic marks occurs in female and male mammals during primordial germ cell development and early embryogenesis, whereas the acquisition of epigenetic marks takes place at different times during female and male gametogenesis.",
              "Indeed, epigenetic marks in female germ cells are established during folliculogenesis, whereas male germ cells acquire their epigenetic marks during fetal development.",
              "73\u201378 The fact that imprints are maintained during early embryogenesis highlights that some sequences may escape reprogramming events.",
              "Stella is among a group of proteins that may play an important role in the suppression of epigenetic reprogramming of these specific sequences.",
              "81 The failure to erase epigenetic marks during primordial germ cell development or subsequent early embryogenesis is at the origin of transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic traits.",
              "A clear example of a gene susceptible to transgenerational inheritance is the Agouti viable yellow (Avy) allele in mice.",
              "82 The variable epigenetic status of an intracisternal A particle element (IAP) located upstream from the coding region of Avy in mice is responsible for the variable expression of this allele in adult mice.",
              "As a result of incomplete erasure of epigenetic marks on IAPs, this variable expression is often transgenerationally inherited by offspring.",
              "82 Evidence suggests that many IAPs fail to undergo epigenetic reprogramming during germ cell development.",
              "83 The high incidence of IAPs in mammalian genomes has consequently led to the belief that this type of transgenerational inheritance may be more prevalent than initially conceived.",
              "Given the extent of epigenetic reprogramming that occurs during gametogenesis and embryogenesis and the vulnerability of the process, it is not difficult to understand how alteration in reprogramming could be of clinical relevance.",
              "Because epigenetic reprogramming occurs during folliculogenesis and embryogenesis, any disturbance of the normal natural environment during these critical phases could cause epigenetic alterations.",
              "Accordingly, researchers have attempted to determine whether children conceived using assistive reproductive technology (ART) carry epigenetic reprogramming defects.",
              "A review of an association of ART and epigenetic alterations is covered in detail in articles later in this issue.",
              "Importantly, although the whole genome is reprogrammed during germ cell development and embryogenesis, it should be noted that to date only a limited number of loci have been investigated.",
              "These loci generally comprise genes in which their epigenetic status significantly affects a perceptible phenotype.",
              "Although a specific clinical phenotype has not yet been associated with an epigenetic change, it is it possible that pathology may emerge from a not yet recognized epigenetic alteration.",
              "84 An excess of epigenetic alterations could have an immediate impact that precipitates pre- or postnatal death.",
              "At the other extreme, an epigenetic change might result in a perceptible alteration later in life such as cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, or diabetes.",
              "An increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes is associated with malnutrition in utero and low birth-weight.",
              "85 Again, the role of nutrition and diet during pregnancy is covered in detail in ensuing articles in this issue, but it must be considered whether children of ART with a low birthweight could have a predisposition for these chronic phenotypes.",
              "Concerns have also been raised about the epigenetic status of tumor suppressors or fertility concerns in individuals exposed to environmental toxins.",
              "Subsequent articles address this issue in greater depth as well, but there is sufficient evidence in animals to warrant concern.",
              "In conclusion, there is reason to suspect that early development is vulnerable to unwanted changes in epigenetic inheritance.",
              "Animal studies have shown that epigenetic reprogramming is a fragile process that is easily modified,86\u201391 and such data provide compelling biologic plausibility for clinical concern.",
              "Although animal models may provide some information, the results may not always be representative of the epigenetic events that occur in humans.",
              "Because of the potential for adverse health effects in offspring conceived using ART and in children born from altered nutritional states in pregnancy or exposed to environmental toxins, further research is needed.",

              "[24][25] Perhaps the most studied clinical application of epigenetic mechanisms is cancer.",
              "One of the first reports of epigenetics involved in cancer reported hypomethylation of DNA in cancer cell genomes, which caused overexpression of genes within that cell.",

              "For example, the degree of DNA methylation continues to decrease as a benign tumor cell progresses to invasive cancer.",
              "[27] Other studies have shown hypomethylation of pro-proliferative genes like BAX2 that are suppressed in normal cells.",
              "[28] Other reports show hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, like Rb, BCRA1, and CDKN2A, in cancer cells.",

              "In addition to cancers, many conditions associated with genomic imprinting are the result of malfunctioning epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms can induce disease, but they are also necessary for normal cell function, specifically in imprinted genes where only one parental chromosome is expressed.",
              "For genomic imprinting to successfully occur, the other parental chromosome must be silenced, which occurs through DNA methylation.",

              "In animal cells, DNA can be modified by methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides, and the N-terminal tails of histone proteins are subject to a wide range of different modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitylation.",
              "All of these chemical changes seem to have a substantial influence on chromatin structure and gene function, which differs depending on the type and location of the modification.",
              "In this Review we take advantage of evidence from recent genetic, biochemical and microarray studies to explore the relationship between DNA methylation and histone modification, particularly focusing on methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) and 27 (H3K27), which are important modifications for gene repression.",
              "Although DNA methylation and histone modification are carried out by different chemical reactions and require different sets of enzymes, there seems to be a biological relationship between the two systems that plays a part in modulating gene repression programming in the organism.",
              "We describe how DNA methylation and specific histone modifications influence each other during mammalian development.",
              "It seems that the relationship can work in both directions: histone methylation can help to direct DNA methylation patterns, and DNA methylation might serve as a template for some histone modifications after DNA replication.",
              "Recent evidence indicates that, at the molecular level, these connections might be accomplished through direct interactions between histone and DNA methyltransferases.",
              "We then discuss how histone modification and DNA methylation can have different roles in gene silencing, with histone modifications providing labile transcriptional repression and DNA methylation being a highly stable silencing mark that is not easily reversed.",
              "Finally, we address how understanding the relationship between these two types of modification can help us to decipher the epigenetic blocks that inhibit cellular reprogramming and to understand mechanisms of gene repression in cancer.",
              "Generating modification patterns Generation of the basal bimodal DNA methylation pattern.",
              "The basic methylation pattern of the animal genome is bimodal: almost all CpG dinucleotides are methylated, except those located in CpG islands, which are to a large extent constitutively unmodified.",
              "The DNA methylation pattern is erased in the early embryo and then re-established in each individual at approximately the time of implantation1,2.",
              "Differential methylation is established through two counteracting mechanisms: a wave of indiscriminate de novo methylation3 and a mechanism for ensuring that CpG islands remain unmethylated.",
              "The precise details of how CpG islands are protected are not completely elucidated, but early studies using transgenic mice and transfection experiments in embryonic stem cells suggested that protection might be directed by the recognition of common cis-acting sequences located in CpG islands4,5,6 and mediated by active demethylation7.",
              "Recent studies strongly suggest that the establishment of the basic DNA methylation profile during early development might be mediated through histone modification8 (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "According to this model, the pattern of methylation of H3K4 (including mono, di and trimethylation, referred to here as H3K4me) across the genome might be formed in the embryo before de novo DNA methylation.",
              "H3K4 methylation might be directed by sequence-directed binding of RNA polymerase II, which recruits specific H3K4 methyltransferases9.",
              "As RNA polymerase II is bound mostly to CpG islands in the early embryo, only these regions are marked by H3K4me, whereas the rest of the genome is packaged with nucleosomes containing unmethylated H3K4.",
              "De novo DNA methylation is carried out by the DNA methyltransferase enzymes DNMT3A and DNMT3B complexed with DNMT3L8,10, a closely related homologue that lacks methyltransferase activity11.",
              "DNMT3L recruits the methyltransferases to DNA by binding to histone H3 in the nucleosome, but contact between DNMT3L and the nucleosome is inhibited by all forms of methylation on H3K4 (Ref.",
              "8).",
              "As a result, de novo methylation in the embryo takes place at the majority of CpG sites in the genome, but may be prevented at CpG islands because of the presence of H3K4me.",
              "This model is consistent with the finding of a strong anti-correlation between DNA methylation and the presence of H3K4me in several cell types12,13,14,15.",
              "Before implantation, most CpGs in the embryonic genome are unmethylated (light purple circles), but some regions are packaged with nucleosomes containing methylated (Me) lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4), perhaps as a result of RNA polymerase binding.",
              "At the time of implantation, the methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are expressed.",
              "DNA methylation (dark purple circles) is facilitated by the Dnmt3 binding partner, DNMT3L, which binds to chromatin by recognizing the K4 residue on histone H3 (Refs.",
              "8, 10).",
              "If this histone moiety is methylated, however, the complex cannot bind and the underlying DNA region is thus protected from de novo methylation.",
              "This may be one of the mechanisms used to generate a bimodal methylation pattern characterized by methylation over most of the genome, but not at CpG islands.",
              "Targeted de novo methylation in early development.",
              "Once the basal bimodal pattern of DNA methylation is established in the embryo at the time of implantation, this profile becomes subject to additional targeted alterations during development, including both de novo methylation and demethylation events12,16.",
              "A significant change that occurs in early development is the targeted repression and de novo methylation of genes that are necessary for preserving pluripotency, such as Oct3/4 (also known as Pou5f1).",
              "This repression occurs at the time of gastrulation \u2014 when the embryo begins to separate into germ layers17 and concomitantly loses the ability to maintain a pluripotent state.",
              "Using embryonic stem cells as a model system, it has been shown that Oct3/4 undergoes inactivation in a multistage process (Fig.",
              "2).",
              "In the first stage, transcription seems to be turned off directly through the interaction of repressor molecules with the Oct3/4 promoter18,19,20.",
              "This is followed by transcription factor-dependent recruitment of a complex that contains the histone methyltransferase G9a and enzymes with a histone deacetylase activity.",
              "This complex mediates local deacetylation of histones \u2014 a change that is associated with transcriptional repression.",
              "Deacetylation resets the lysine residues so that G9a can catalyse methylation of H3K9.",
              "This modification enables binding of the chromodomain protein heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which facilitates local formation of heterochromatin (heterochromatinization).",
              "In the final stage of silencing, the G9a-containing complex also recruits DNMT3A and DNMT3B, which catalyse de novo DNA methylation at the promoter21.",
              "This series of steps, mediated by the G9a-containing complex, seems to have a central role in post-implantation gene inactivation, with many other crucial genes (such as Nanog and Dnmt3L) also undergoing repression through this pathway22.",
              "In embryonic stem cells, pluripotency genes such as Oct3/4 and Nanog have unmethylated CpG islands (light purple circles) and are packaged with acetylated (Ac) histone H3 and H4 and methylated (Me) lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4).",
              "With the onset of differentiation the SET domain-containing histone methyltransferase G9a is recruited, together with a histone deacetylase (HDAC), and this causes deacetylation of local histones.",
              "In addition, H3K4 is demethylated, but the enzymatic machinery responsible for this has not yet been identified.",
              "In the next step, G9a catalyses the methylation of H3K9, and this modification serves as a binding site for the chromodomain protein heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), thus generating a form of local heterochromatin.",
              "Finally, G9a recruits the methylases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, which mediate de novo methylation (dark purple circles) of the underlying DNA21,22.",
              "A further example of how de novo DNA methylation might be linked to histone modification in early development is the heterochromatinization of pericentromeric satellite repeats.",
              "At these satellite sequences, it is the SET domain-containing histone methyltransferase enzymes SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 that are responsible for trimethylating H3K9 and heterochromatinization.",
              "These proteins are also required to recruit DNMT3A and DNMT3B in order to methylate CpG sites in the satellite sequences23,24.",
              "Interestingly, this heterochromatinization process seems to be initiated by a Dicer-mediated mechanism that recognizes RNA duplexes that are naturally formed at satellite sequences.",
              "The resulting RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) is then specifically targeted back to pericentromeric regions where it probably recruits SUV39H1 and SUV39H2, which are the most important components in this heterochromatin pathway25,26,27,28.",
              "Indeed, non-coding RNA may also play a part in recruiting histone methylases in other cases of gene inactivation, such as at imprinted loci and during X chromosome inactivation29,30,31.",
              "These two examples of pluripotency-associated gene silencing and satellite sequence repression illustrate how histone modification and DNA methylation can have a cooperative relationship in the early embryo.",
              "These studies, in animal cells, indicate that there is an intimate relationship between DNA and histone methylation, and this is strongly supported by genetic manipulation experiments.",
              "Indeed, studies in Neurospora crassa32, Arabidopsis thaliana33 and animal cells21,22,23 show that knockdown of certain SET domain histone methyltransferases causes a decrease in DNA methylation in specific genomic regions.",
              "Conversely, the tethering of the histone methyltransferase G9a to a random region of the DNA in animal cells seems to cause histone methylation and DNA methylation at nearby sequences34.",
              "Effect of DNA methylation on histone modification.",
              "The examples discussed above illustrate how histone modifications might play a role in establishing the patterns of DNA methylation, but there is also evidence that DNA methylation is important for maintaining patterns of histone modification through cell division.",
              "After the bimodal methylation profile is established in the pluripotent embryo, the enzymatic machinery needed for this process is then downregulated35 and, following differentiation, cells generally lose both their de novo methylation activity and their ability to recognize and protect CpG islands.",
              "Nonetheless, the basic DNA methylation pattern that is generated at the time of implantation is maintained throughout development through the action of DNMT1, which is associated with the replication complex36.",
              "Recent studies indicate that DNMT1, together with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UHRF1 (also known as Np95 or ICBP90), specifically recognizes the methylated CpG residues of the hemimethylated DNA that is generated during DNA replication and methylates the opposite strand37,38,39, thus reproducing a faithful copy of the methylation profile that is present in the parent cell.",
              "Despite the importance of chromatin conformation in moulding transcription patterns, it is likely that chromatin structures are disrupted as the replication fork progresses along the DNA, so mechanisms are needed to reproduce chromatin conformation after replication has occurred.",
              "The DNA methylation pattern might be one of the main markers that are used for reconstructing the epigenetic state of the genome following cell division.",

              "[1] Despite not directly altering the DNA sequence, epigenetic mechanisms can regulate gene expression through chemical modifications of DNA bases and changes to the chromosomal superstructure in which DNA is packaged.",
              "Briefly, negatively charged DNA is packaged around a positively charged histone protein octamer, which contains 2 copies of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.",
              "[2] This nucleoprotein complex is a nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin.",
              "[3] The nucleosomes of a continuous DNA polymer are connected by linker DNA and the complex is stabilized by histone protein H1.",
              "The aggregation of chromatin results in the formation of a chromosome.",
              "The chromatin of a chromosome exists as either loose, transcriptionally active euchromatin or dense, transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.",
              "[4] Chemical alterations to histone proteins can induce the formation of either the open euchromatin state, which facilitates gene expression by allowing transcription factors and enzymes to interact with the DNA, or the closed heterochromatin state, which suppresses gene expression by preventing initiation of transcription.",
              "In addition to histone changes, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism associated with gene silencing when the methylation occurs in CpG islands of promoter sequences.",
              "[5] Further, non-coding RNA sequences have shown to play a key role in the regulation of gene expression.",
              "[6] These epigenetic modifications can be induced by several factors including age, diet, smoking, stress, and disease state.",
              "[7][8] Epigenetic modifications are reversible, but they rarely remain through generations in humans despite persisting through multiple cycles of cell replication.",
              "[9] Epigenetic mechanisms form a layer of control within a cell that regulates gene expression and silencing.",
              "This control varies between tissues and plays an important role in cell differentiation.",
              "[10] Additionally, differences in gene expression between cells, which are driven by epigenetic modifications, result in the unique function of specific cell types.",

              "In cancer, the normal epigenetic patterns are disrupted resulting in the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes like CDKN2A.",
              "[12] Three different epigenetic mechanisms have been identified: DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing.",
              "Catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes, DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group directly to a cytosine nucleotide within a cytosine-guanine sequence (CpG), which are often surrounded by other CpG\u2019s forming a CpG island.",
              "CpG islands are common targets for epigenetic DNA methylation, notably the CpG islands within promoter regions.",
              "Indeed, it has been reported that around 70% of gene promotor regions lie within CpG islands.",
              "[13] Methylated cytosines within a promoter region recruit gene suppressor proteins and reduce interaction between the DNA and transcription factors.",
              "[14] Cytosine methylation also drives the formation of heterochromatin, so the nucleosome tightening prevents transcriptional machinery from interacting with the DNA.",
              "[15] As such, DNA methylation within promoter regions results in gene silencing.",
              "Cancers often show marked hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of proto-oncogenes, both of which contribute to tumor carcinogenesis.",
              "[15] This epigenetic mechanism also plays an important role in tissue-specific gene regulation, genomic imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation.",
              "[14] The second epigenetic mechanism is post-translational modifications to histone proteins.",
              "These modifications include enzyme-catalyzed acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, each of which alters the DNA-histone interactions in nucleosomes.",
              "[16] Histone acetylation often occurs at positively charged lysine residues which weakens the DNA-histone interactions, thus opening the chromatin and facilitating transcription.",
              "[17] For example, acetylation of lysine 9 and lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac, respectively) correlates with transcription activation.",
              "Histone methylation is more complex as it does not change the histone protein charge and can include the addition of 1-3 methyl groups to lysine and 1-2 methyl groups to arginine.",
              "[17] For example, methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me) is associated with transcription activation while trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) correlates with transcription repression.",
              "[18] Histone phosphorylation involves the addition of a negative phosphate group to the histone tail, but less is known of its function aside from phosphorylation of H2A(X) playing a role in the response to DNA damage and its subsequent repair.",
              "[19] Histone ubiquitylation involves the addition of a large ubiquitin molecule to lysine residues.",
              "Examples of histone ubiquitylation include H2AK119ub, which is associated with gene silencing, and H2BK123ub, which is involved in transcription.",
              "[17] Aside from the relatively straightforward effect of histone acetylation on gene expression, the effects of other histone modifications are complex and greatly influenced by the state of nearby DNA molecules.",
              "The most recently elucidated epigenetic mechanism is non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing.",
              "A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is transcribed but not translated into proteins.",
              "Once regarded as waste of the genome, recent insight suggests the ncRNA molecules harbor a crucial role in epigenetic gene expression and likely account for the great difference in phenotype between species and within human populations despite such similarity in encoded proteins.",
              "[6][18] Notable ncRNA molecules include microRNAs (miRNA) and short interfering RNAs (siRNA), which include less than 30 nucleotides, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which are 200 nucleotides or longer.",
              "Though the full extent of their role in epigenetics is still being determined, there is evidence suggesting that ncRNAs participate in DNA methylation and histone modifications in addition to gene silencing.",
              "[20] siRNAs and lncRNAs both have been shown to regulate gene expression by the formation of heterochromatin.",
              "[6][21] As people age, the largest influence on the epigenome is the environment.",
              "Direct influencers such as diet can affect one's epigenome, as determined by the Dutch famine studies.",
              "[22][23] Other environmental stressors include smoking and psychological stress.",
              "Epigenetic changes in utero are particularly sensitive as the epigenetic profile of the fetus is forming and developing rapidly during this time.",
              "[24] Indeed, teratogens like cigarette smoke, alcohol, and specific minerals have shown to induce in utero epigenetic changes.",
              "[24][25] Perhaps the most studied clinical application of epigenetic mechanisms is cancer.",
              "One of the first reports of epigenetics involved in cancer reported hypomethylation of DNA in cancer cell genomes, which caused overexpression of genes within that cell.",
              "[26] Since this report, great strides have been made toward understanding the role of epigenetics in carcinogenesis.",
              "For example, the degree of DNA methylation continues to decrease as a benign tumor cell progresses to invasive cancer.",
              "[27] Other studies have shown hypomethylation of pro-proliferative genes like BAX2 that are suppressed in normal cells.",
              "[28] Other reports show hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, like Rb, BCRA1, and CDKN2A, in cancer cells.",
              "[29][30][31] Despite the wealth of knowledge present on the relationship between epigenetics and carcinogenesis, treatment development is still very much in the preliminary phase for most cancers.",
              "Epigenetics is a promising field of research because of the potential to regulate gene expression without changing the DNA sequence, which may likely cause safety and ethical concerns if performed in humans.",
              "The most promising way to treat diseases through epigenetic regulation has been through pharmacology.",
              "Previous clinical trials for drugs formulated to block epigenetic modifications associated with cancers have proved successful.",
              "The FDA has approved a number of these drugs which target epigenetic regulators to treat various cancers including azacytidine and decitabine for myelodysplastic syndrome, panobinostat for multiple myeloma, and romidepsin for cutaneous T cell lymphoma.",
              "[32] More drugs are likely to be approved in the coming years as a number of clinical trials for DNA methylation inhibitors and histone modification inhibitors are underway.",
              "In addition to cancers, many conditions associated with genomic imprinting are the result of malfunctioning epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms can induce disease, but they are also necessary for normal cell function, specifically in imprinted genes where only one parental chromosome is expressed.",
              "For genomic imprinting to successfully occur, the other parental chromosome must be silenced, which occurs through DNA methylation.",
              "Noteworthy conditions associated with abnormalities in gene imprinting include Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, and Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome.",
              "[33][34] Recent studies have shown positive results for epigenetic-based therapies for imprinting disorders, which may be a field of increased focus in the coming years in search of better treatments.",

              "[1] Despite not directly altering the DNA sequence, epigenetic mechanisms can regulate gene expression through chemical modifications of DNA bases and changes to the chromosomal superstructure in which DNA is packaged.",
              "Briefly, negatively charged DNA is packaged around a positively charged histone protein octamer, which contains 2 copies of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.",
              "[2] This nucleoprotein complex is a nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin.",
              "[3] The nucleosomes of a continuous DNA polymer are connected by linker DNA and the complex is stabilized by histone protein H1.",
              "The aggregation of chromatin results in the formation of a chromosome.",
              "The chromatin of a chromosome exists as either loose, transcriptionally active euchromatin or dense, transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.",
              "[4] Chemical alterations to histone proteins can induce the formation of either the open euchromatin state, which facilitates gene expression by allowing transcription factors and enzymes to interact with the DNA, or the closed heterochromatin state, which suppresses gene expression by preventing initiation of transcription.",
              "In addition to histone changes, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism associated with gene silencing when the methylation occurs in CpG islands of promoter sequences.",
              "[5] Further, non-coding RNA sequences have shown to play a key role in the regulation of gene expression.",
              "[6] These epigenetic modifications can be induced by several factors including age, diet, smoking, stress, and disease state.",
              "[7][8] Epigenetic modifications are reversible, but they rarely remain through generations in humans despite persisting through multiple cycles of cell replication.",
              "[9] Epigenetic mechanisms form a layer of control within a cell that regulates gene expression and silencing.",
              "This control varies between tissues and plays an important role in cell differentiation.",
              "[10] Additionally, differences in gene expression between cells, which are driven by epigenetic modifications, result in the unique function of specific cell types.",
              "[11] Genome-wide patterns of DNA and histone modifications are established during early development and are maintained throughout multiple cell divisions.",
              "In cancer, the normal epigenetic patterns are disrupted resulting in the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes like CDKN2A.",
              "[12] Three different epigenetic mechanisms have been identified: DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing.",
              "Catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes, DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group directly to a cytosine nucleotide within a cytosine-guanine sequence (CpG), which are often surrounded by other CpG\u2019s forming a CpG island.",
              "CpG islands are common targets for epigenetic DNA methylation, notably the CpG islands within promoter regions.",
              "Indeed, it has been reported that around 70% of gene promotor regions lie within CpG islands.",
              "[13] Methylated cytosines within a promoter region recruit gene suppressor proteins and reduce interaction between the DNA and transcription factors.",
              "[14] Cytosine methylation also drives the formation of heterochromatin, so the nucleosome tightening prevents transcriptional machinery from interacting with the DNA.",
              "[15] As such, DNA methylation within promoter regions results in gene silencing.",
              "Cancers often show marked hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of proto-oncogenes, both of which contribute to tumor carcinogenesis.",
              "[15] This epigenetic mechanism also plays an important role in tissue-specific gene regulation, genomic imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation.",
              "[14] The second epigenetic mechanism is post-translational modifications to histone proteins.",
              "These modifications include enzyme-catalyzed acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, each of which alters the DNA-histone interactions in nucleosomes.",
              "[16] Histone acetylation often occurs at positively charged lysine residues which weakens the DNA-histone interactions, thus opening the chromatin and facilitating transcription.",
              "[17] For example, acetylation of lysine 9 and lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac, respectively) correlates with transcription activation.",
              "Histone methylation is more complex as it does not change the histone protein charge and can include the addition of 1-3 methyl groups to lysine and 1-2 methyl groups to arginine.",
              "[17] For example, methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me) is associated with transcription activation while trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) correlates with transcription repression.",
              "[18] Histone phosphorylation involves the addition of a negative phosphate group to the histone tail, but less is known of its function aside from phosphorylation of H2A(X) playing a role in the response to DNA damage and its subsequent repair.",
              "[19] Histone ubiquitylation involves the addition of a large ubiquitin molecule to lysine residues.",
              "Examples of histone ubiquitylation include H2AK119ub, which is associated with gene silencing, and H2BK123ub, which is involved in transcription.",
              "[17] Aside from the relatively straightforward effect of histone acetylation on gene expression, the effects of other histone modifications are complex and greatly influenced by the state of nearby DNA molecules.",
              "The most recently elucidated epigenetic mechanism is non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing.",
              "A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is transcribed but not translated into proteins.",
              "Once regarded as waste of the genome, recent insight suggests the ncRNA molecules harbor a crucial role in epigenetic gene expression and likely account for the great difference in phenotype between species and within human populations despite such similarity in encoded proteins.",
              "[6][18] Notable ncRNA molecules include microRNAs (miRNA) and short interfering RNAs (siRNA), which include less than 30 nucleotides, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which are 200 nucleotides or longer.",
              "Though the full extent of their role in epigenetics is still being determined, there is evidence suggesting that ncRNAs participate in DNA methylation and histone modifications in addition to gene silencing.",
              "[20] siRNAs and lncRNAs both have been shown to regulate gene expression by the formation of heterochromatin.",
              "[6][21] As people age, the largest influence on the epigenome is the environment.",
              "Direct influencers such as diet can affect one's epigenome, as determined by the Dutch famine studies.",
              "[22][23] Other environmental stressors include smoking and psychological stress.",
              "Epigenetic changes in utero are particularly sensitive as the epigenetic profile of the fetus is forming and developing rapidly during this time.",
              "[24] Indeed, teratogens like cigarette smoke, alcohol, and specific minerals have shown to induce in utero epigenetic changes.",
              "[24][25] Perhaps the most studied clinical application of epigenetic mechanisms is cancer.",
              "One of the first reports of epigenetics involved in cancer reported hypomethylation of DNA in cancer cell genomes, which caused overexpression of genes within that cell.",
              "[26] Since this report, great strides have been made toward understanding the role of epigenetics in carcinogenesis.",
              "For example, the degree of DNA methylation continues to decrease as a benign tumor cell progresses to invasive cancer.",
              "[27] Other studies have shown hypomethylation of pro-proliferative genes like BAX2 that are suppressed in normal cells.",
              "[28] Other reports show hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, like Rb, BCRA1, and CDKN2A, in cancer cells.",
              "[29][30][31] Despite the wealth of knowledge present on the relationship between epigenetics and carcinogenesis, treatment development is still very much in the preliminary phase for most cancers.",
              "Epigenetics is a promising field of research because of the potential to regulate gene expression without changing the DNA sequence, which may likely cause safety and ethical concerns if performed in humans.",
              "The most promising way to treat diseases through epigenetic regulation has been through pharmacology.",
              "Previous clinical trials for drugs formulated to block epigenetic modifications associated with cancers have proved successful.",
              "The FDA has approved a number of these drugs which target epigenetic regulators to treat various cancers including azacytidine and decitabine for myelodysplastic syndrome, panobinostat for multiple myeloma, and romidepsin for cutaneous T cell lymphoma.",
              "[32] More drugs are likely to be approved in the coming years as a number of clinical trials for DNA methylation inhibitors and histone modification inhibitors are underway.",
              "In addition to cancers, many conditions associated with genomic imprinting are the result of malfunctioning epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms can induce disease, but they are also necessary for normal cell function, specifically in imprinted genes where only one parental chromosome is expressed.",
              "For genomic imprinting to successfully occur, the other parental chromosome must be silenced, which occurs through DNA methylation.",
              "Noteworthy conditions associated with abnormalities in gene imprinting include Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, and Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome.",
              "[33][34] Recent studies have shown positive results for epigenetic-based therapies for imprinting disorders, which may be a field of increased focus in the coming years in search of better treatments.",

              "Epigenetic processes are essential for development and differentiation, but they can also arise in mature humans and mice, either by random change or under the influence of the environment2.",
              "Epigenetic mechanisms also guard against viral genomes that would otherwise hijack cellular functions for their own ends3.",

              "however, this gene is conserved in Drosophila, highly expressed during oogenesis and may be responsible for the small amount of non-CpG methylation seen in the fly embryo29,30.",
              "Genetic analysis of the various DNMTs has established that DNA methylation is essential for vertebrate development.",
              "Loss of methylation causes apoptosis in embryos31,32 and fibroblasts33, but not in embryonic stem (ES) cells20,21 or human cancer cells34, and leads to both widespread derepression of ectopic gene expression33 and transcriptional activation of transposable elements35.",
              "Deletion of Dnmt1 during brain development results in perinatal respiratory distress and causes the elimination of mutant neurons within 3 weeks of postnatal life36.",
              "Potential explanations for the evolution of DNA methylation invoke its ability to silence transposable elements37 or its function as a mediator of developmental gene regulation or transcriptional noise reduction11.",

              "In non-embryonic cells, methylated sites are distributed globally on about 80% of CpGs.",
              "Interrupting this relatively featureless sea of genomic methylation are the CpG islands\u2014short sequence domains that generally remain unmethylated at all times, regardless of gene expression38,39,40,41.",

              "In this way the reported interactions53,54 between DNMTs and histone deacetylases (HDACs) may allow genes that are already silenced by co-repressors to invite the de novo methylation that can make silencing permanent.",
              "Histone modifications other than deacetylation are also strongly implicated in triggering the de novo methylation of DNA.",
              "Most markedly, methylation of histone H3 at Lys9, which is clearly linked to gene silencing, has been shown to be essential for DNA methylation in the fungus Neurospora crassa55 and in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana56.",
              "Evidence for an equivalent dependence in mammalian systems is eagerly sought.",
              "In the case of methylation of Lys9 on histone H3, and in the PML-RAR example described above, the silent chromatin state provokes DNA methylation, supporting the view that DNA methylation is acting as a system of cellular memory that is not directly involved in initiating gene silencing but senses and propagates the silent state11.",
              "Biochemical evidence indicates that DNA methylation is just one component of a wider epigenetic program that includes other postsynthesis modifications of chromatin7,57,58.",
              "Several chromatin modification states are either mutually reinforcing or mutually inhibitory.",
              "The resulting feedback loops may function to ensure functional polarization of chromatin domains, stably committing them to either transcriptional activity or transcriptional silence.",
              "Under such a scheme (Fig.",
              "1a), uncommitted chromatin states would be unstable and therefore rare.",
              "Switching between active and inactive states would be unlikely to occur by chance, because several self-reinforcing steps would work against the transition, pulling a domain that is 'drifting' towards an alternative activity state back to the 'poles'.",
              "Current data offer support for such a scheme, because methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 can promote DNA methylation, and acetylation and methylation of lysine 9 are mutually exclusive (Fig.",

              "Given sets of reference epigenomes generated by performing various epigenomic assays in a set of cell-types, the epigenomic imputation task posed by ChromImpute is that of predicting epigenomic tracks representing combinations of cell-type and assay for which experimental data are not available, thereby \u2018completing\u2019 the epigenomic map.",
              "To solve this problem, ChromImpute adopts a regression-based approach, requiring the training of a separate ensemble of models for each target track.",
              "While ChromImpute has shown effective performance, it relies on the manual engineering of input feature sets and the training of thousands of separate models, preventing the effective sharing of information across the highly related tasks of the imputation of different tracks.",

              "Nonetheless, the performance of these approaches has only outstripped ChromImpute on a subset of metrics.",
              "Seeking to combine the strengths of prior approaches, we developed a deep learning model, eDICE (epigenomic Data Imputation via Contextualized Embeddings), based on framing the epigenomic imputation problem as one of masked input reconstruction.",
              "During training, a random subset of the observed signal values for a set of epigenomic tracks at a single genomic position is masked out, and the model is tasked with learning to impute the masked values given the remaining observed values.",
              "Unlike in standard masked input reconstruction applications, the epigenomic imputation problem requires models to be capable of predicting signal values for tracks never seen during training, representing novel combinations of cell type and assay.",
              "To achieve this combinatorial form of generalization, eDICE encodes the input signal at the genomic position of interest into separate latent representations summarizing the local epigenomic state of each cell type and the local activity profile of each assay.",
              "The signal value in a masked track is then reconstructed by concatenating the representations for the relevant cell type and assay and passing them through a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) decoder.",
              "At test time, predictions for new tracks can be generated in the same way, by feeding the model with the signal values of a set of observed tracks at a genomic location of interest, and decoding from the representations of the target cell type and assay.",
              "To implement the factorized encoding of local epigenomic signal, we developed a self-attentive neural network module (Fig.",
              "1), based on the Set Transformer architecture26.",
              "This module starts by independently encoding the signal in each cell type and each assay, then constructs \u2018contextualized\u2019 representations of each cell type and each assay by transferring information among related cell types and related assays using self-attention.",
              "By conditioning on observed signal values to build representations of the local epigenomic state, rather than learning location-specific embeddings, eDICE achieves the generalization capacity of tensor factorization models while offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and performance.",

              "In an attempt to provide a balanced view of model quality, we report performance on a selection of metrics designed to capture three desirable characteristics of imputations: (i) global similarity between imputations and ground truth values (ii) similarity between imputations and ground truth values focusing on foreground (Fg) and background (Bg) bins, as determined by MACS228 and (iii) discriminative accuracy for a peak vs non-peak classification task.",
              "The first two categories are assessed using mean-squared error and Pearson correlation on the arcsinh-transformed signal values, while in the latter category, we measure peak classification performance via the threshold-agnostic area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), as well as by precision and recall after calling peaks on the imputations using MACS2.",

              "However, the role of epigenetics in human diseases has been considered from a half of century ago.",
              "In the last decade, this subject has attracted many interests, especially in complicated disorders such as behavior plasticity, memory, cancer, autoimmune disease, and addiction as well as neurodegenerative and psychological disorders.",
              "This review first explains the history and classification of epigenetic modifications, and then the role of epigenetic in biology and connection between the epigenetics and environment are explained.",
              "Furthermore, the role of epigenetics in human diseases is considered by focusing on some diseases with some complicated features, and at the end, we have given the future perspective of this field.",
              "The present review article provides concepts with some examples to reveal a broad view of different aspects of epigenetics in biology and human diseases.",
              "Classical definition by Conrad Waddington in the 1950s states \u201can epigenetic trait is a stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence\u201d[1].",
              "Based on our understanding of epigenetics, actual epigenetic definitions express that the whole DNA content is exactly the same in somatic cells of one species, while gene expressions patterns have distinct differences in various cell types that can be clonally inherited[2].",
              "Epigenetic mechanisms can influence the gene activity at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and/or at the translation level and post-translational modifications.",
              "Such epigenetic mechanisms with a potentially vast spectrum of consequences could result in more varieties of cell differentiations, morphogenesis, variability, and adaptability of an organism, which can be affected by both genetic and environmental factors[3].",
              "Therefore, the field of epigenetics covers the modifications of DNA, DNA-binding proteins, and histones, which are important in making changes in chromatin structure without any change in the nucleotide sequence of a given DNA.",
              "Also, some of these alterations could be transferred between generations[4].",
              "Following Fleming\u2019s discovery of chromosome in 1879, Thomas Hunt Morgan demonstrated that there is a genetic linkage between several Drosophila genes and X chromosome.",

              "\u201d[2,5,6].",
              "In the past few decades, many investigations have shown that the epigenetic mechanisms are involved in regulation of all biological process in the body from conception to death.",
              "These functional mechanisms are involved in genome reorganization, early embryogenesis and gametogenesis, as well as cell differentiation.",
              "The interplay of DNA methylation and histone post-translational alterations, which cause as the result of regulatory proteins and non-coding RNAs, are key epigenetic players to rearrange chromatin into areas such as euchromatin, heterochromatin, and nuclear compartmentalization.",
              "Epigenetic signs may have long-term impressions, for instance, in learning and organizing memory or predispositions to different cancers.",
              "Incorrect epigenetic marks can result in birth defects, childhood diseases, or symptoms of diseases in other interims of life.",
              "Epigenetic mechanisms also regulate development and adaptations during the life of an organism, and their alterations may result in various disorders such as cancer.",
              "On the other hand, some epigenetic marks can be reversible, and this fact has encouraged many researchers to focus on epigenetic therapy[7].",
              "In recent years, it has been demonstrated that DNA methylation, in some cases, can be irreversible[7-9].",
              "This trait could be useful in complex features and challenging diseases such as memory function, psychological behaviors and injuries, addiction, cancer, and other diseases that could not be explained just by genetic factors or the environment.",
              "In a multicellular organism, the epigenetic changes enable different adult cells to express specific genes that are required for the existence of each cell type and transfer of information to the daughter cells.",

              "Three major epigenetic modification mechanisms are shown in Figure 1.",
              "Three major epigenetic modification mechanisms. A) DNA methylation.",
              "DNA methylation is mediated by DNA methyltransferase enzymes at CpG sites.",
              "It can also decrease gene expression by reducing the binding of transcription factors or increasing the binding of methyl-CpG binding proteins[11,12,59,100].",
              "B) Histone modification.",
              "Histone acetylation, particularly in lysine residues of histone tails, is an important histone modification that can accelerate binding transcription factors and then gene expression beside DNA demethylation[18,59].",
              "C) miRNA.",
              "The formation of miRNA begins in nucleus and continues in cytosol that can perform a mechanism to regulate gene expression in mRNA level[101].",
              "DNA methylation status has high stability and serves as a special epigenetic memory of specific cells throughout all periods in the cell cycle.",
              "It may also regulate the expression and the activity of histone codes.",
              "Acceleration of DNA methylation at CpG sites is mediated by DNA methyltransferase enzymes such as DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b.",
              "Inside the cells, S-adenosyl methionine act, as an important methyl group donor.",
              "In this sense folic acid and B12 play the determinant roles in re-methylation or the attraction of de-methylated form of S-adenosyl methionine through passive and active mechanisms[11,12].",
              "A number of studies have demonstrated that these effective factors could change DNA methylation patterns and alter the levels of gene expression[13,14].",
              "Studies have also confirmed that the nutritional status in the early years of life could affect DNA methylation pattern and gene expression levels in adulthood[15].",
              "Furthermore, the methylation patterns in CpG sequences at cytosine residues can be heritable and act as tissue- and species-specific features.",
              "It is interesting that 70% to 80% of human DNA in CpG sequences are usually methylated[9,16], and correlations between methylation and expression levels in cis and trans have been reported[17].",
              "Totally, DNA methylation, as a very impressive epigenetic agent, could influence the development of mutations, DNA faultless and durability, gene expressions, and chromatin modifications.",
              "Histone modification is one way of gene regulation through chromatin remodeling and includes acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ribosylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, and citrullination.",
              "Acetylation has been studied frequently in different investigations, and it has been shown to be mediated by five families of mammalian histone acetyltransferase enzymes[18].",
              "Another group of molecules, known to act as non-histone modifiers, is RNA transcripts, which are necessary to maintain the activity of genes (directly or indirectly).",
              "For example, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 increases the special gene transcription level, and MyoD has similar effects on muscle-specific genes[19].",
              "miRNAs are about 17 to 25 nucleotides and are considered as a member of the non-coding RNAs that can mediate a large number of biological activities[20].",
              "It has been demonstraed that the expression of miRNAs in a cell can regulate functions of about 200 messenger RNAs as their targets[21].",
              "miRNAs can also regulate about 60% of protein-coding genes in human[22], and many miRNAs are epigenetically adjusted by methylation in CpG islands or histone modifications or both of them[20,23].",
              "Structural inheritance is another non-histone mechanism of inheritance.",
              "Experimentally, it has been shown that altered cellular patterns are inherited to the next generation of cells, and it appears that the present structures act as templates for new structures[24].",
              "Also, evidence has confirmed the importance of positioning in addition to epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, which play an important role in structural inheritance[25].",
              "An important issue in interpreting epigenetic and genetic modifications is the concept of mitosis gene bookmarking.",
              "Mitosis can play an important role in remodeling the transcriptional landscape.",
              "This view confirms that bookmarking mechanisms provide flexibility to permit alteration in cellular fate or differentiation.",
              "The distinct kinetics of dissociation and re-association of factors during mitosis as well as varying stabilities of histone marks argue that multiple mechanisms control mitotic partitioning[26].",
              "Mitotic chromatin is transcriptionally inactive[27] and is excluded from most of the factors such as transcription agents and RNA polymerases[26,28-32].",
              "To correct and complete cell division, regulatory proteins should re-use their exact genomic targets to return gene transcription states appropriately[26,33-36].",
              "Studies have shown that the exact post-mitotic restoration of suitable transcriptional patterns is affected by epigenetic marking of mitotic chromatin to prevent tragic regulatory results[37,38].",
              "For example, certain histone and DNA modifications remain in mitotic chromatin [39-42].",
              "DNA methylation keeps transcription silent until the completion of mitosis[23,43], whereas specific histone modifications do not show such a clear effect on gene expression, and there are more elusive states and relations.",
              "After mitosis, to reactivate different sites of genes, transcription factors have to find their appropriate sites, which are located in transcriptionally silent chromatin through mitosis process[26].",
              "For instance, poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 creates stable epigenetic marks in metaphase chromatin at the transcription start sites of many genes that are necessary to restart transcription after mitosis[28].",
              "Epigenetic modifications are a dynamic process reflecting a complex interplay between an organism and its environment.",
              "For example, the acetylation of lysine residues in histone subunits usually can result in promoting gene transcription, or the methylation of Lys9 or Lys27 of histone H3 is correlated with gene repression.",
              "However, the methylation of Lys4, Lys36, or Lys79 of H3 is ordinarily associated with gene activity[44].",
              "The heritable quantity of gene expressions is about 30%, while this percentage is decreased to about 23% in cells grown in culture.",
              "Such associations between methylation levels and genetic variations have been demonstrated in several organisms, tissues, and populations[17,45,46].",
              "Animal studies in rats[7] have shown that hippocampal-dependent contextual learning can elicit a remarkably persistent fear-related memory, and this behavior is dependent on denovo DNA methylation.",
              "The inhibitors of DNMTs could abolish fear-related memory by preventing DNA methylation.",
              "Other studies have suggested that histone acetylation and DNA methylation influence memory formation, and DNA methylation has a key role in the storage of long-term memories in cortical brain regions[7,17].",
              "The role of methylation in biological clock has been an interesting discovery in recent years.",
              "Studies of 353 epigenetic markers (DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotide) in DNA have made it possible to predict the ageing of tissues[47].",
              "Also, the role of methylation and acetylation during differentiation has been demonstrated by studying Oct4 promoter regions[48].",
              "Epigenome generally comprises all epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as non-coding RNAs at any given point in time.",
              "The cell epigenome is dynamic and can be affected by genetic and environmental factors.",
              "Furthermore, epigenetic modifications can be reversible, which makes the genome flexible to respond to environment changes such as nutrition, stress, toxicity, exercise, and drugs[17].",
              "In the winter of 1944/45 during World War II, food supply was reduced due to blocked food transport by Germans, and food delivery by boat was impossible because water canals were frozen.",
              "Famine and lack of sufficient vitamins and proteins in diets affected the whole population, especially pregnant women.",
              "Since then studies have been carried out on the long-term effects of this incidence on newborn babies and individuals under such conditions.",
              "The results of these studies showed that individuals born after the famine had a higher susceptibility to a subset of diseases, including schizophrenia, stress sensitivity, and obesity[17].",
              "One of the nutritional components in food, which plays a major role in methylation, is folate.",
              "Folate can influence methionine production by homocysteine remethylation in the form of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.",
              "It has been reported that folate defect or shortage can enhance colorectal carcinogenesis through hypomethylation of genomic DNA[12].",
              "Stress is an important environmental factor.",
              "Recently, some studies have demonstrated that people with post-traumatic stress disorder, who were abused during childhood, exhibit different levels of DNA methylation and gene expressions in comparison to those who were not abused[49,50].",
              "Also, maternal stress during gestation has been indicated to be associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.",
              "Long-term studies on children exposing to stress in utero have shown to be predisposed to psychiatric disorders because of an increase in the promoter activities of glucocorticoid receptor[17,51,52].",
              "As a human, we are exposed to various environmental toxins on a daily basis, and this can affect our health through changes in our epigenome.",
              "Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and Streptococcus pneumonia have been shown to induce dramatic changes in acetylations of histones via the toxins they produce[53,54].",
              "Arsenic exposure studies have been demonstrated to result in global DNA alterations and gene promoters methylation levels, histone acetylation, histone phosphorylation, and miRNA expressions.",
              "Such influences of arsenic exposure have been linked to epigenetic dysregulation and carcinogenesis[55].",
              "One of the major effects of physical exercise is on epigenetic modifications that can be beneficial to health and cancer patients.",
              "Modifications in DNA methylation patterns as a result of physical exercise can increase the expression of genes involved in tumor suppression and decrease the expression levels of oncogenes.",
              "Studies have shown that DNA methylation patterns are different in cancer cells, and hypermethylations and hypomethylations have been observed in the promoter of tumor-suppressing genes and oncogenes.",
              "These modifications could result in uncontrollable growth leading to tumorigenesis[56,57].",
              "In patients with type II diabetes, several genes have been reported to be hypermethylated in muscle, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and coactivator 1-alpha[58,59].",

              "It has been shown to be correlated with many human diseases, including different cancers, autoimmune disorders, neurological disorders (Fragile X syndrome as well as Huntington, Alzheimer, and Parkinson diseases and schizophrenia).",
              "Also, it has been suggested that methylation can be considered for complicated diseases influenced by some secondary factors such as sex differences and age, which could change disorder severity[62].",

              "Of note, with regards to epigenetic drift, either the collective methylation drift rate (a first order process) or the increase in variance of CpG methylation levels with age (a second order process) may be used as a measure of tissue age (35, 41).",

              "The molecular mechanisms responsible for the epigenetic aging process remain to be confidently determined, but several putative candidate mechanisms have been identified.",
              "The first candidate mechanism is the error prone nature of the DNMT enzymes that do not copy with 100% fidelity the DNAm patterns from parent DNA strand to daughter DNA strand.",

              "e., CGIs) have been shown to undergo epigenetic drift because of sporadic de novo methylation errors that occur when tissue stem cells replicate their genome hundreds to thousands of times during an individual's lifetime (51\u201354).",
              "A second mechanism that is concurrently in operation and that leads to aberrant DNAm is related to the base excision repair DNA repair system.",
              "It is postulated that hypermethylated CpG regions may gradually or quickly lose their methylation marks, either passively when DNAm maintenance is compromised during DNA replication or actively via TET enzymes that oxidize 5-methylcytosines and promote the locus-specific reversal of DNAm through base excision repair (55).",
              "The relative contributions of passive and active processes on epigenetic aging are not known but both mechanisms likely lead to the aberrant DNAm of candidate tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes.",
              "Although DNMTs are generally active only during cell proliferation, epigenetic clocks show age-progression in nonproliferating tissues (37, 56), and recent studies provide evidence of dynamic DNA modifications in non-dividing neurons (57).",
              "These results strongly suggest processes involved in active demethylation in cancers (58, 59).",
              "However, despite the plausibility of TET affecting epigenetic clock behavior, there is little direct evidence demonstrating the role of active demethylation, other than through TET enzymes or base excision repair, in epigenetic aging processes (60, 61).",
              "Determining the mechanisms behind epigenetic clocks is of more than academic importance because it could inform us how they relate to other age-related cellular processes such as senescence, mutation accumulation, loss of mitochondrial function, and epigenetic silencing and cancer (62\u201364).",
              "For example, because DNA maintenance enzymes (DNMT) act in concert with the DNA replication fork (65\u201367), higher drift rates may either reflect higher rates of cell cycling or a higher rate of methylation errors.",
              "The importance of distinguishing the roles of cell-cycle frequency versus methylation error rates may be appreciated when one considers that the aberrant DNAm resulting from low fidelity DNMT activity can globally contribute to increased genomic alterations and epigenetic alterations, whereas in contrast, an increased rate of de novo methylation errors likely would mainly contribute to cancer formation via altering specific cancer driver genes, like MLH1, because these would require clonal expansion events to be detectable (68).",
              "Beyond intrinsic cellular mechanisms, a variety of studies in ex vivo tissue culture systems and animal models have demonstrated that repeated exposure to environmental factors, such as reactive oxygen species from oxidative stress, dietary factors (e.",
              "g. genestein, curcumin) can also induce DNAm alterations, raising the possibility that epigenetic aging may also result from cumulative lifetime exposures affecting these factors (69\u201371).",
              "Although the Horvath and Hannum clocks are highly correlated with the chronologic age of the individual, they also show considerable variability around the population mean, which suggests that they may also measure a component of the biological age of the individual (35, 36).",
              "This raises the question as to whether there is a mechanism underlying the epigenetic alterations that drive the divergence between chronologic age and biological age.",
              "If so, then it may be possible that inter-individual differences in susceptibility to cancer risk are significantly associated with differences in biological aging and the predicted biological age as measured by epigenetic clocks or epigenetic drift.",

              "It is plausible that the stochastic process inherent in epigenetic drift can induce aberrant methylation events that accumulate in normal cells and eventually induce cancer formation, as suggested by a common set of changes in the DNAm pattern during aging and in cancer (22).",
              "This process is akin to the role of random mutagenesis in age-related cancer.",
              "For those clones that acquire a cancer-promoting epigenetic alteration secondary to epigenetic drift or clock phenomenon, they outcompete other clones and contribute to the clonal evolution of the cancer.",
              "The concept that age-dependent DNAm could predispose normal cells to cancer is supported by the observations of abnormal epigenetic-drift\u2013related changes in various normal tissues at risk for cancer formation, such as the colon (54), the buccal mucosa of smokers (72), the hematopoietic stem cells of the elderly (73), and the skin (74).",

              "Recently, studies have found epigenetic age acceleration in the blood samples collected from patients who developed cancer at follow up, compared with cancer-free participants (33, 76\u201378).",
              "It is noteworthy that the association of epigenetic age acceleration in the blood samples with cancer risk likely reflects a systemic effect of DNAm changes on cancer predisposition, such as through immune system alterations captured in the leukocyte DNAm alterations, which is in distinct contrast with epigenetic drift in the tissue samples, which may predispose to cancer via altering tumor suppressor genes and/or oncogenes that drive the expansion of cancer-initiating clones.",
              "It is well accepted that the majority of human cancers develop via the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations over time (79).",
              "However, the vast majority of aberrant methylation events in cancers, even when affecting gene promoters, do not appear to effect gene expression because the majority of genes that undergo aberrant DNAm are not expressed in normal adult tissues (80, 81).",
              "This observation raises interesting questions of how epigenetic aging contributes to cancer formation and what leads to certain gene-associated CpGs or CGIs being selected for methylation in cancers.",
              "One possibility is that a time-dependent stochastic event process, like epigenetic drift, could lead to cancer formation through the accumulation of random epigenetic alterations that, through chance, eventually alter epigenetic driver gene expression, leading to a clone of cells destined to become cancer.",
              "Indeed, although the phenomenon of (epi)genetic drift is generally associated with phenotypic neutrality, it is possible that coordinated or collective drift at the CGI level may cease to be neutral as methylation levels exceed certain thresholds that correlate with the potential to alter tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes by interfering with the transcriptional regulation at gene promoters, insulators, and enhancers (51, 82).",
              "One concrete example demonstrating how age-related DNAm could promote cancer formation is HAND2, a gene encoding a member of the basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix family of transcription factors highly expressed in the endometrial stroma.",

              "This raises the possibility of heritable \u2018epimutations\u2019 contributing to heritable phenotypic variation and thus to evolution.",
              "Recent work has shed light on both the signals that underpin these epimutations, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, and the mechanisms by which they are transmitted across generations at the molecular level.",
              "These mechanisms can vary greatly among species and have a more limited effect in mammals than in plants and other animal species.",
              "Nevertheless, common principles are emerging, with transmission occurring either via direct replicative mechanisms or indirect reconstruction of the signal in subsequent generations.",

              "As the basis of genetic information, DNA sequence is the foundation of life on Earth.",
              "However, its proper implementation requires another level of information, in the form of regulatory signals.",
              "The study of these signals is known as \u2018epigenetics\u2019, a term originally coined by Conrad Waddington in 1942 that has since undergone several redefinitions.",
              "In this Review we consider epigenetics to denote \u201cthe study of molecules and mechanisms that can perpetuate alternative gene activity states in the context of the same DNA sequence\u201d1.",
              "This definition encompasses those molecular signals peripheral to the DNA that are generally referred to as epigenetic, such as DNA methylation or modification of histone proteins, as well as more recently discovered gene regulatory signals such as 3D genome organization.",
              "It also includes both mitotic inheritance of these signals and inheritance across generations, which is the focus of this Review.",
              "Examples of epigenetic inheritance across generations were reported in fungi and animals decades ago2,3,4,5, but whether this type of inheritance was widespread, particularly in mammals, remained unclear.",
              "When discussing epigenetic inheritance, it is important to distinguish between \u2018intergenerational\u2019 and \u2018transgenerational\u2019 inheritance6 (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "Intergenerational inheritance occurs when an organism in which a change is triggered, for instance by an environmental stimulus, passes this change on to its immediate offspring.",
              "However, apparent observations of such short-term inheritance do not necessarily entail the transmission of an epigenetic signal.",
              "In a first instance, an epigenetic change may be triggered in the parent only, having a different effect on its germline, which then manifests in the offspring but is subsequently lost.",
              "Alternatively, the change may be triggered directly but separately in both parent and offspring.",
              "Indeed, exposure of the parent entails exposure of the parent\u2019s germline, which includes the cells that will go on to produce the next generation.",
              "Thus, in a sense, the offspring were directly exposed to the stimulus as well.",
              "For an epigenetic change to be transgenerational it must be inherited past the point at which the individual that carries it had direct contact with the environmental cue, demonstrating that the epigenetic signal is being maintained in the absence of this stimulus.",
              "In mammals, this means inheritance starting from the F2 generation if the male parent was exposed, or the F3 if the female parent was exposed (given that exposure of a pregnant female results in exposure of the germline of her fetus also).",
              "Epigenetic change can arise in an individual sporadically or by exposure to some environmental stimulus.",
              "If this change is passed on to the next generation, it becomes a heritable epigenetic mark.",
              "Inheritance in the immediate offspring of the individual in which the change arose is termed \u2018intergenerational\u2019.",
              "In mice this corresponds to inheritance in the F1 generation for an exposed male parent or in the F1 and F2 generations for an exposed female.",
              "This is due to the exposure not only of the individual mouse but also its germline and potentially, in the case of the female, of its unborn offspring\u2019s germline.",
              "Beyond these first generations many epigenetic signals are lost, and inheritance does not proceed past the intergenerational stage.",
              "In some cases, however, the signal is maintained in the F2/F3 generations and beyond.",
              "Past this point, it is termed \u2018transgenerational\u2019 epigenetic inheritance, because the epigenetic signal is maintained even in the absence of the initial stimulus or epigenetic trigger.",
              "There is abundant evidence for intergenerational epigenetic inheritance7,8, but the relevance of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI), although proposed for a long time, has been more controversial, particularly in mammals9,10.",
              "This is in part due to the difficulty in proving that phenotypic differences are epigenetic in origin, not genetic.",
              "It is only relatively recently that technical advances coupled with carefully controlled studies, primarily in model organisms, have provided robust evidence for TEI and insight into its molecular mechanisms. While such comprehensive evidence remains scarce with regard to mammalian TEI, correlational studies continue to raise the possibility of an epigenetic component in several inherited phenotypes.",
              "The strong case for TEI in some other organisms may also open the door for a comparative approach, by which our newfound understanding of TEI in species such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster may be brought to bear on possible cases of TEI in mammals.",
              "However, care must be taken in such an approach not to draw too many similarities between such disparate organisms, as an increasing body of evidence shows that TEI mechanisms can vary greatly and, in many cases, are likely to have evolved independently.",
              "The implications of these findings are wide-ranging, and call for a re-evaluation of the relative contribution of epigenetics and genetics to phenotype.",
              "To this end, some studies have already revealed heritable epigenetic factors in diseases such as cancer11 and obesity12.",
              "A major tenet of evolutionary biology is that genetic information is the ultimate basis for selection.",
              "However, it has been proposed that \u2018epimutations\u2019 may contribute to short-term survival in a changing environment, or represent precursors to later genetic mutations13.",
              "These factors have been reviewed elsewhere and will not be the focus of our discussion.",
              "Several other reviews give an excellent overview of the field and the evidence for TEI in various organisms1,6,8,14.",
              "In this Review, we discuss our current understanding of the molecular underpinning of TEI: the mechanistic basis that makes all these implications possible.",
              "We first describe the molecular signals \u2014 that is, the non-DNA sequence-based carriers of epigenetic information that underpin epimutations \u2014 citing examples of TEI across many organisms in which such signals are implicated.",
              "We then look at the mechanisms by which these different signals are transmitted from one generation to the next.",
              "We see how knowledge of these molecular processes helps to bridge the gap between environment and phenotypic response, and also provides a better understanding of the role that epigenetic information may play in inheritance and fitness, areas long thought to be the sole domain of genetics.",
              "Before we discuss the mechanisms by which epigenetic information is transmitted across generations, we must first define the molecular signals that underpin this information.",
              "Although we will primarily deal with these signals individually, it is important to note that they by no means exist in isolation, and are indeed frequently in cooperation with each other within the context of the cell.",
              "Whenever possible or most relevant we will make every effort to highlight the interaction between these molecular signals.",
              "However, for the sake of clarity, we will frequently consider them independently to focus on one particular aspect of TEI.",
              "The covalent addition of a methyl group to a DNA nucleotide is a well known epigenetic mark.",
              "It can occur in several forms and in a variety of organisms, but the best studied, and most relevant to TEI owing to its mechanism of transmission, is the methylation of cytosine in CpG dinucleotides (Box 1).",
              "Although it is present in invertebrate and fungal species, it is in vertebrates and plants that DNA methylation has the most prominent role in transcriptional regulation and thus the greatest potential to contribute to transgenerationally inherited phenotypes.",
              "Because the mechanisms of deposition, transmission and action of CpG methylation are very well understood, it is often proposed to be the molecular basis for observed inheritance of epigenetic phenotypes in vertebrates.",
              "In particular, many studies have investigated changes in DNA methylation triggered by ancestral exposure to some environmental insult.",
              "However, these studies frequently limit themselves to parent-to-offspring transmission and proof of the inheritance of the phenotype to the F3 or beyond is rare.",
              "In Table 1 we present some of the more recent or compelling examples of TEI, for which a molecular mechanism is at least suggested.",
              "These include DNA methylation-associated cases of transgenerational adaptations of behaviour in birds15, sex determination in fish16 and pesticide-triggered pathologies in mammals17.",
              "Two classic examples of epigenetic inheritance in mice are the Agouti viable yellow (Avy) and Axin fused (AxinFu) alleles.",
              "Both are so-called metastable epialleles: alleles that are variably expressed in genetically identical individuals (reviewed in ref.",
              "18).",
              "The variable expression of both alleles results from the insertion of retrotransposons of the intracisternal A-particle (IAP) family adjacent to a gene, resulting in CpG methylation levels that vary considerably between individuals, while remaining relatively constant between tissues of a single individual.",
              "This variation leads to a coat colour phenotype in Avy mice and a \u2018tail-kink\u2019 phenotype in AxinFu mice, both of which can be inherited across generations.",
              "A comprehensive screen for other metastable epialleles similar to Avy and AxinFu identified 87 candidate variably methylated IAPs19.",
              "However, only one of the six experimentally validated candidates showed parental inheritance of the methylation pattern, raising the question of how widespread this phenomenon actually is.",
              "It is interesting to note that although these phenotypic differences result from epigenetic variation, this variation is dependent on a particular \u2018permissive\u2019 genetic framework, namely an IAP retrotransposon.",
              "Further work on the aforementioned library of variably methylated IAPs also demonstrated that their methylation state was highly susceptible to genetic background effects, linked to a cluster of Kru\u0308ppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger proteins20.",
              "These findings highlight the difficulty of separating genetic from epigenetic factors in inheritance.",
              "In contrast to the few confirmed examples in mammals, the involvement of CpG methylation in epigenetic inheritance in plants is more pervasive, and is in fact one of the clearest instances of TEI.",
              "Natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana for instance have been found to vary greatly in their cytosine methylation, with any two accessions differing from each other by between 90,000 and 500,000 differentially methylated positions21,22.",
              "Much of this natural variation is expected to be due to changes in the underlying DNA sequence variation, although some is thought to be truly epiallelic.",
              "In addition, artificially induced methylation differences have also been found to be maintained for many generations.",
              "Epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) have been generated by breeding parents from the same genetic background, one with a mutation in a DNA methylation gene and the other with the wild-type version of the gene.",
              "From this initial cross, further offspring are produced that recapitulate the parental wild-type background, eliminating the mutation.",
              "In this way, many genetically identical wild-type individuals are produced from a common ancestor that had DNA methylation defects.",
              "Interestingly, these individuals have drastically different methylation profiles, which can be maintained until at least the F8 generation23.",
              "Many striking instances of phenotypic variation in various plant species have been ascribed to heritable DNA methylation.",
              "Natural DNA methylation variation at the Lcyc locus in the toadflax species Linaria vulgaris was found to directly correlate with flower morphology, resulting in either bilateral or radial symmetry24.",
              "In tomatoes, methylation of the promoter of the LeSPL-CNR gene results in reduced expression and colourless, non-ripening fruits25.",
              "Additionally, methylation at the FWA promoter in A.",
              "thaliana results in a late-flowering phenotype26.",
              "Other examples are included in Table 1.",
              "However, owing to the complex and often redundant nature of plant genomes, the widespread but small methylation differences evoked above are more likely to produce frequent but subtle changes in gene expression patterns27.",
              "Thus, rather than underlying switch-like differences in phenotype at a single locus, the most important role of DNA methylation-based epialleles in plants is probably as a contributing factor to the broad spectrum of natural variation in quantitative trait loci (QTLs), governing such complex and frequently polygenic traits as plant size or flowering time.",
              "Indeed, DNA methylation was found to underlie several \u2018epiQTLs\u2019 in A.",
              "thaliana28, and four such loci were independently shown to confer partial resistance to a fungal pathogen29.",
              "In this way, DNA methylation and DNA sequence polymorphisms can accumulate and combine at several loci to produce variation in a single complex trait.",
              "This complexity once again raises an important question about considering the relative contribution of both genetic and epigenetic factors to phenotype, especially with regard to QTLs and polygenic phenotypes.",
              "While it is certainly true that epigenetics underlies more phenotypic variation than previously thought, it is also the case that studies on epigenetic responses to environmental stimuli rarely assess the potential impact of genetic variation on the observed phenotypes.",
              "Even environmental stimuli that are not historically thought to induce DNA mutations may in fact be triggering genomic instability and genetic changes that can be selected for.",
              "This has been found, for instance, in what has long been held up as a classic example of TEI, the so-called \u2018canalization\u2019 experiments performed by Conrad Waddington in D.",
              "melanogaster30.",
              "This type of analysis should be included more generally in TEI papers in order to fully parse the contribution of genetic and epigenetic factors to environmental responses.",
              "The examples provided by mouse metastable epialleles also illustrate the importance that genetic background can have on epigenetic variation20.",
              "Similarly, the formation of plant epiRILs shows that the initiation of an epigenetic change may require a genetic mutation, albeit a temporary one.",
              "These are themes that are relevant to cases of TEI in other organisms (see below)31,32.",
              "Examples like these raise the question of whether or not these phenomena can be said to be truly \u2018epigenetic\u2019 if underlying them are fundamentally genetic processes.",
              "Indeed, proteins, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and transposons are all encoded in the DNA sequence, which also contributes much of the regulatory information for genome function.",
              "Thus, many phenomena that appear epigenetic at first glance might ultimately be genetically determined.",
              "Nevertheless, claims for epigenetic inheritance can be made by demonstrating that other molecules carry heritable information to subsequent generations in addition to that carried by the DNA sequence.",
              "This is the case in several systems, including mouse IAPs and plant epiRILs, which represent cases of non-DNA sequence-based variation between genetically identical individuals across several generations, fitting comfortably within the definition of TEI.",
              "DNA is primarily methylated on the cytosines of CpG dinucleotides in most organisms, although methylation of CHG and CHH (where H is A, T or C) also occurs, most notably in plants152,153.",
              "This modification is initially catalysed by a \u2018de novo methyltransferase\u2019, which adds a methyl group to the cytosine at the 5\u2032 position of the pyrimidine ring85 (see the figure, part a).",
              "How and when this de novo methylation is targeted varies between organisms. In vertebrates the de novo DNA methyltransferase 3 (DNMT3) enzymes are most active during two key stages of development, gametogenesis and the pre-implantation stage152, to establish new patterns of methylation following reprogramming.",
              "In plants, de novo methylation occurs by an RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway in concert with the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway (see Box 3).",
              "Its timing in development is more complex and occurs at a variety of stages153.",
              "The symmetrical nature of the CpG dinucleotide provides a simple mechanism by which its methylation can be maintained across cell division.",
              "Upon replication the methylated parental strands are separated and new unmethylated daughter strands are synthesized from their template, such that the resultant double-stranded DNA molecules are asymmetrically methylated.",
              "A \u2018maintenance methyltransferase\u2019 (DNMT1 in vertebrates, MET1 in plants) recognizes this hemi-methylated DNA and methylates the unmodified cytosine85 (see the figure, part a).",
              "This mechanism makes CpG methylation the ideal candidate for a \u2018true\u2019 epigenetic mark, with the potential to maintain itself indefinitely unless interfered with.",
              "Methylation at non-CG sites is dependent on other maintenance methyltransferases, which rely more on factors external to the DNA methylation itself, including the local chromatin landscape153.",
              "In both plants and animals the most relevant function of DNA methylation to gene expression is to repress transcription initiation, which it achieves by blocking or promoting the binding of effector proteins to gene promoters152,153.",
              "Key among these are the methyl-binding domain (MBD) family of proteins, which bind to methylated CpG and recruit an array of histone modifiers (including the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase Suv39 and several histone deacetylases (HDACs)), chromatin remodellers (primarily of the SWI/SNF family such as Mi-2, BRM and ATRX) and more154 (see the figure, part b).",
              "CpG methylation is thus a key component of the transcriptional regulation machinery with a clear mechanism of transmission, and is therefore an attractive candidate for the underlying cause of epialleles.",

              "The chemical modifications that can be applied to histones are many and varied, as are their potential effects on the underlying DNA.",
              "In addition to their well known role in regulating the expression of genes, many histone modifications have properties that lend themselves well to TEI.",
              "These include the potential for self-propagation and spreading of the epigenetic signal by coupling \u2018reader\u2019 and \u2018writer\u2019 functions (Box 2).",
              "Two modifications frequently involved in TEI are the repressive marks histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and H3K27me3.",
              "In many cases these marks are inextricably linked to other epigenetic signals.",
              "H3K9me3, for instance, is strongly associated with DNA methylation in vertebrates33, and can thus be considered a factor in many of the examples alluded to in the previous section17,18,34.",
              "On the other hand, there are examples of TEI in which histone modifications appear to be the sole or primary epigenetic signal.",
              "In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where DNA methylation is absent, H3K9me has been shown to be heritable under certain conditions when deposited ectopically31 (where H3K9me refers collectively to H3K9me2 and H3K9me3).",
              "In addition to such artificial instances of H3K9me TEI, exposure of S.",
              "pombe to environmental insults such as caffeine and oxidative stress can also induce epimutations that can be inherited across generations35.",
              "In the case of caffeine exposure, several epimutant strains were generated, many of which were genetically identical to the wild type, in which caffeine resistance had arisen from heritable silencing of key genes by H3K9me.",
              "These epimutations were not tracked through meiosis, although in another study similar H3K9me-based epimutants were inherited through both mitosis and meiosis36.",
              "In this case, however, the modifications were coupled with small RNA silencing mechanisms, which will be discussed in other contexts below.",

              "elegans38, resulting in derepression of certain genes for several generations.",
              "These events were not linked to any other epigenetic signal and seem to arise more from the failure of the self-maintenance system of H3K9me3 to re-establish the lost histone mark than from any mechanism actively maintaining a derepressed state.",
              "Whether this lag in recovery is an evolutionary adaptation for plasticity or simply a flaw in the machinery is an interesting question with implications for the role of TEI in response to environmental stress.",

              "Although H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 are the most frequently found histone modifications in TEI, other marks are known to contribute to TEI (Table 1) and it is likely that others have gone unnoticed thus far.",

              "Thus, psychopathologies can be considered one of the most interesting and flourishing fields in the application of epigenetics.",
              "Initially, and for a long time, parental influences on an offspring\u2019s development were focused on two possible sources of variance: genes and the environment.",

              "This idea fits well with the Darwinian concept of adaptation as an all-or-nothing process, which can be recalled easily from the collective imaginary through such terms as \u201csurvival,\u201d \u201creproductive power,\u201d and \u201claw of large numbers.",

              "Conversely, an alternate perspective has focused on another form of adaptation, residing conceptually inside the lifespan of each individual: ontogenetic development.",
              "In the previous gene-centered model, ontogenesis was subordered to phylogenies and was considered a mechanistic unfolding of a predefined genetic program.",
              "This idea was progressively revisited when the central \u201cdogma\u201d of molecular biology (proposed by Crick, 1958) was redefined and complemented in light of the growing evidence on the complexity and bidirectionality of gene expression-related processes (Gottlieb, 2007).",

              "As we will see, experimental manipulation in animal models could overcome these problems. For this reason, we will attempt to unify and organize this potentially confusing terminological flowering in a coherent conceptual framework.",

              "The genes that encode for such crucial functional elements are called immediate-early genes, because a change in their expression is the first event that launches cascades of adaptive events, including the transcriptional aspects of other genes (Johnson, 2010), ultimately producing even long-lasting effects.",
              "As we will discuss, these factors regulate the expression of genes that encode for other functional proteins, as well as for different classes of regulatory elements, such as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), that can mediate epigenetic processes.",
              "Recently, some authors have highlighted the function of ncRNAs in regulating, more or less directly, several epigenetic processes in the development of an individual and in epigenetic inheritance (Peschansky and Wahlestedt, 2014;",

              "Chromosomal DNA is packaged around histone cores to form nucleosomes.",
              "Nucleosome spacing in open structure that is accessible to nuclear factors is maintained, in part, by post-translational modification of histone tails, including lysine acetylation and specific lysine methylation.",
              "CpG dinucleotides are unequally distributed throughout chromosomal DNA, and may be concentrated in regions called CpG islands that can overlap gene promoters.",
              "Methylation of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides is overall associated with inactive, condensed states of the chromosome.",
              "Inactive chromatin is also maintained by specific histone lysine modifications.",
              "Chromatin Domains In differentiated mammalian cells, the principal epigenetic tag found in DNA is that of covalent attachment of a methyl group to the C5 position of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotide sequences (referred to as CpG throughout this review)3.",
              "Recent findings suggest that in undifferentiated stem cells, cytosines, other than those in CpG, can be methylated, as well, 4 and that methylation of non-CpG cytosines is crucial for gene regulation in embryonic stem cells in particular.",
              "CpG methylation is, however, an important mechanism to ensure the repression of transcription of repeat elements and transposons, and also plays a crucial role in imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation 5.",
              "Transcriptional gene silencing by CpG methylation also restricts the expression of some tissue-specific genes during development and differentiation by repressing them in non-expressing cells.",
              "During development, the pattern of CpG methylation changes in a predictable manner.",
              "In early embryogenesis, methylation is erased throughout the genome and then reestablished in all but CpG islands (regions of the genome with a concentration of CpG residues).",
              "CpG islands remain hypomethylated until later in development when some of them become methylated 6, 7.",
              "Subsequent methylation of cytosines in CpG islands and at other CpG dinucleotides is associated with transcriptional repression 6, 8, especially when these methylated sites involve promoter or other gene regulatory regions 3.",
              "DNA methylation may, however, be activating if it prevents binding or limits expression of transcriptional repressors.",
              "Recent studies defining the degree of methylation in mammalian promoters indicate that methylation occurs at only a small percentage of CpG dinucleotides and inhibits transcription of only a small subset of genes in differentiated cells.",
              "Many of these repressed genes are germline-specific 8, including pluripotency genes, suggesting that methylation is a crucial mechanism by which to suppress key genes during differentiation 8.",
              "CpG methylation can supress transcription by several mechanisms. First, the presence of the methyl group at a specific CpG may directly block DNA recognition and binding by some transcription factors.",
              "For example, several studies have shown that transcriptional activation at GC-boxes is inhibited by methylation, which excludes binding of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors, at least in some promoter contexts 9, 10.",
              "Methylation has also been shown to block the ability of the nuclear factor, Hif1, from inducing erythropoietin transcription under hypoxic conditions 11.",
              "Alternatively, other factors may preferentially bind to methylated DNA, blocking transcription factor access.",
              "For example MeCP2 and other family members 12 bind to methyl CpG and contribute to transcriptional repression by the recruitment of histone-modifying proteins, such as histone deacetylases (HDAC).",
              "Subsequently, histone deacetylation promotes chromatin condensation, further repressing transcription 13, 14.",
              "This sequence of events illustrates how DNA methylation and certain histone modifications function together to contribute to the transcriptional on or off state of genes subject to epigenetic modification (Figure 1).",
              "A family of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs) is involved in de novo DNA methylation and its maintenance.",
              "During embryogenesis, de novo methylation is carried out by DNMT3A and DNMT3B 15.",
              "Although some studies suggest an ongoing role for DNMT3A and DNMT3B in maintaining methylation status in some cell types 16, 17, the ubiquitously expressed DNMT1 is predominantly responsible for maintaining cellular levels of CpG methylation.",
              "Interestingly, transcription from alternative promoters results in expression of a truncated oocyte-specific DNMT1 isoform, DNMT1o, that is essential for early embryogenesis 18.",
              "DNMT1 functions in a complex to recognize hemi-methylated DNA and to add methyl groups to the non-methylated daughter strand formed during replication 19.",
              "The base pairing of CpG allows for the reciprocal maintenance of methylation during subsequent replication cycles.",
              "In this manner, a non-genetic trait (DNA methylation) can be passed from cell to cell and, with it, the contextual effects on gene expression.",
              "Thus, methylation can be considered a long-term, relatively stable, epigenetic trait, the effects of which can contribute to maintaining the cellular phenotype.",
              "Owing to its heritability, DNA methylation is a powerful means by which to suppress the expression of unwanted or excess genes.",
              "Several basic questions remain unanswered, such as the mechanisms that promote targeting of specific CpG sites for methylation or prevent their modification.",
              "Many of the insights into the mechanistic aspects of targeting CpG methylation come from studies of imprinting and X-inactivation, where CpG methylation represses gene expression in chromosomal regions.",
              "X-inactivation occurs in somatic cells of females to limit the expression of most X-chromosome genes to those from one chromosome.",
              "Given the random nature of X-chromosome inactivation, female carriers may display a wide variation in phenotypic expression of X-linked disorders 20.",
              "Similarly, imprinting regulates autosomal gene expression to genes from only one parental allele in males and females.",
              "The importance of imprinting and gene dosage regulation in normal development can be appreciated by the consequences of imprinting disturbances that cause a number of human syndromic disorders, such as Prader-Willi, Angleman, Silver-Russell, and Beckwith\u2013Wiedermann (reviewed in 21, 22).",
              "In imprinting, clusters of genes in a chromosomal region are coordinately inhibited by methylation of an imprinting center;",
              "these centers are also referred to as differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and DMRs often overlap CpG islands.",
              "Recent studies suggest that transcription of DMRs in the oocyte may target them for subsequent CpG modification by maintaining an open chromatin structure accessible to de novo methylation 23.",
              "In both imprinting and X-inactivation, the expression of long non-coding RNAs 24, such as the Xist transcript in X-chromosome inactivation 25, may also play a regulatory role.",
              "Chromatin conformation is apparently essential for the imprinting of some maternally determined imprinted genes.",
              "In particular, histone H3-lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase, LSD1, has been found to be essential for these processes, and deficiency of this enzyme results in embryonic stem cell lethality during early differentiation 26, 27.",
              "To date, the mechanisms involved in specifying methylation of DMRs during imprinting include recognition of specific DNA sequence motifs in imprinting centers, the expression of factors that are oocyte-specific to mark maternal chromosomes, chromatin remodeling, and/or combinations of these events.",
              "Similar mechanisms may also target methylation of specific gene promoters during differentiation.",
              "CpG methylation is erased in a predictable manner during gametogeneis and following zygote fertilization.",
              "Recent findings suggest that these processes require the action of cytidine deaminases, such as AID, as well as DNA repair mechanisms 28, 29.",
              "Thus, enzymatic deamination of 5-methylcytosine leads to formation of thymine and T:G base-pair mismatches: base excision repair mechanisms subsequently delete thymine and restore C:G base pairing during epigenetic reprogramming.",
              "Spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine also requires base excision repair mechanisms to repair base pairing mismatch, a process that is highly inefficient in most differentiated cells.",
              "Thus, spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine has resulted in an overall depletion of CpG dinucleotide sequences in mammalian genomes (over evolutionary time)30.",
              "In differentiated, adult cells, CpG methylation is considered long-lasting and refractory to elimination, except by alterations in the expression or activity of DNTM1 (Figure 2) (or following spontaneous deamination and mismatch repair).",
              "Recently, however, a novel mechanism involving specific DNA demethylation in response to hormone stimulation has been discovered 31.",
              "In this system, the cytochrome p45027B1 (CYP27B1) gene is repressed by vitamin D-interacting repressor (VDIR)-mediated recruitment of DNA methylases and MBD4, a methyl DNA binding protein.",
              "Transcriptional suppression can be relieved by parathyroid hormone (PTH)-induced demethylation of promoter CpGs.",
              "Apparently, in the presence of PTH-induced phosphorylation, MBD4 can mediate demethylation of promoter CpGs through a base-excision repair mechanism that removes methylcytosine, apparently without deamination.",
              "This hormone-induced mechanism contrasts with excision-repair mechanisms described above in that it is targeted to a specific promoter by hormone action and it does not require deamination 32 (Figure 2).",
              "Other recent studies suggest a role for DNMT3 in active demethylation at estrogen receptor-\u03b1-responsive promoters that also exhibit hormone-induced alterations in CpG methylation status 33, 34.",
              "Although further studies are needed to confirm these mechanisms, the concept of hormone-induced methylation switching adds a new twist to epigenetic regulation.",
              "It remains to be seen whether other genes can be similarly regulated by methylation switching utilizing these or other, as yet, unknown mechanisms. DNA methylation at the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides is initiated de novo by the DNA methyl transferases (DNMT) 3A and 3B.",
              "Following replication, DNMT1 plays a primary role in maintaining the methylation state in the daughter strands.",
              "Demethylation is thought to occur by reduction of DNMT1 activity or by excision repair mechanisms following deamidation of methyl cytosine (meC) to create a T:G mismatch.",
              "Recent findings (discussed further in the text) suggest that the methyl-DNA binding protein 4 (MBD4) may mediate demethylation by an hormonally regulated mechanism that does not involve deamination of meC, rather it involves the DNA glycosylase activity of MBD4 followed by a base-excision repair mechanism.",
              "DNA methylation tags promote the persistence of certain histone states, such as deacetylation, thus providing a mechanism for perpetuating post-translational histone modifications.",
              "Histones can be post-translationally modified to restructure chromatin in many ways, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and methylation35, 36.",
              "In fact, the \u2018Histone Code Hypothesis\u2019 suggests that different combinations of histone modifications may regulate chromatin structure and transcriptional status 37, 38.",
              "Details, such as the location of nucleosomes relative to the transcriptional start site of a gene, together with specific combinations of sites, types, and extents of histone modifications, add to the complexity of the histone code (reviewed in 1, 39).",
              "Nonetheless, efforts have been made to characterize patterns of histone modifications that contribute to cell-type specific regulation of genes in differentiated cells, such as those associated with smooth muscle-specific genes regulated by serum response factor binding to the CArG box 40.",
              "Of the many described histone modifications, histone acetylation, at the \u03b5-amino group of lysine residues in H3 and H4 tails, is most consistently associated with promoting transcription.",
              "However, this description oversimplifies a complex process, as acetylated, open-chromatin structure may also allow access of transcriptional repressors.",
              "For example, some bromodomain-containing factors, such as BRG1 and Brd4, target to acetylated histones where they can mediate the formation of repressor (or activator) complexes 41, 42.",
              "Acetylation is targeted to regions of chromatin by the recognition and binding of DNA sequence-specific transcription factors that recruit one of a growing family of histone acetyl transferase (HAT) cofactors such as CREB binding protein (CBP), and p300, MYST, and GNAT (see Table 2 for a list of histone modifying enzymes) 43.",
              "Disruption of the normal acetylation activity of CBP/p300 family members is associated with Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome, an autosomal dominant syndrome 44, 45, highlighting the importance of these cofactors in regulating the proper expression of gene combinations important in development and differentiation.",
              "Histone Modifying Enzymes Deacetylation of histones correlates with CpG methylation and the inactive state of chromatin.",
              "There are 4 classes of histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs), with members capable of deacetylation of histones and/or other protein targets 46.",
              "These regulatory proteins are themselves subject to regulation by acetylation, phosphorylation, and sumoylation 47, which can affect their function, subcellular distribution, and protein-protein associations 48.",
              "Several studies suggest that interactions with sequence-specific DNA binding proteins and co-repressor complexes can target certain HDAC proteins to histones in a gene-specific manner 49, 50.",
              "Histone lysine methylation patterns and their effects on transcription are more complex than acetylation, in that some methylation sites are associated with transcriptionally permissive chromatin (euchromatin) and some are repressive, fostering heterochromatin formation.",
              "In addition, \u03b5-amino groups of lysine residues can be mono-, di-, or tri-methylated.",
              "Overall, the H3K27me3 and H3K9me states are associated with silencing, whereas the H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 states are transcriptionally permissive modifications (see Table 3 for a list of histone methylation sites).",
              "Importantly, methylation marks recruit effector proteins that play essential roles in maintaining the transcriptional state of the chromatin, for example H3K9me recruits HP1, contributing to heterochromatin formation.",
              "Histone methylation sites Most histone lysine methyltransferases have a SET homology domain, a vast family of proteins that can be grouped into 7 subfamilies based on their structural similarities 39.",
              "SET1 family members specifically foster active chromatin by methylating H3K4.",
              "Other histone lysine methyltransferase families can methylate several histone targets.",
              "In addition, some of these methyl transferases have additional domains that specify binding to methylated DNA or to other proteins, such as CBP 39.",
              "Until recently, histone methylation was considered a long-term epigenetic marker as the only mechanism for its removal was histone turnover;",
              "however, recent studies confirm the existence of multiple histone demethylases capable of demethylating histone lysine methyl groups.",
              "These enzymes include lysine-specific demethylase 1-(LSD1), which removes mono- or di-methyl groups from H3K4.",
              "The tri-methylated modification is targeted for removal by the Jumonji C-(JmjC) domain-containing demethylases 51 (see Table 2).",
              "Similar to histone methylases, LSD1 and JmjC family proteins may demethylate histones in a gene-specific manner, directed, in part, by interactions between demethylases and DNA sequence-specific nuclear factor complexes.",
              "In addition, recent studies show that specific histone demethylases may regulate androgen-mediated transcriptional responses and osteoblast differentiation 52\u201354.",
              "As discussed above, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an essential role in imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation.",
              "The gene silencing effects of these lncRNAs and other lncRNAs, such as HOTAIR in the human homeobox loci, are due, in part, to their recruitment of remodeling complexes such as the polycomb complex that foster histone methylation (notably the inhibitory H3K27me3) 55\u201357.",
              "In addition, lncRNAs can also suppress transcription by other mechanisms, such as the recruitment of RNA-binding proteins that interfere with histone deacetylation or exclude TFIID promoter association 58, 59.",
              "There is also a growing literature on the role of small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) and their effects on transcriptional gene silencing.",
              "This group of RNAs includes the dicer-dependent microRNAs (miRNAs) and small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) formed by RNA-interference pathways, as well as the piRNAs, that are formed in a dicer-independent manner and specifically associate with the PIWI subfamily of argonaute proteins.",
              "Although each of these classes of sncRNAs have been shown to mediate epigenetic DNA and histone modifications, the piRNAs appear to have a distinct function of repressing transposon expression in germline cells by fostering de novo DNA methylation 60.",
              "A role for siRNA in RNA-mediating DNA methylation and transcriptional gene silencing was first discovered in plants 61 and has been found to exist in many species, including mammals 62.",
              "Recent findings in mammalian cells suggest that synthetic siRNAs and endogenous miRNAs that target gene promoters may direct transcriptional gene silencing by recruiting specific argonaute proteins and forming epigenetic remodeling complexes that suppress gene expression by fostering histone deacetylation, histone methylation (H3K9 and H3K27), and DNA methylation 63\u201365.",
              "In fact, although the mechanism has not been completely elucidated, dicer-deficient ES cells exhibit defects in differentiation that correlate with a loss of de novo DNA methylation and loss of miRNAs66, suggesting a role for endogenous miRNAs in regulating necessary epigenetic changes during differentiation.",
              "Other studies indicate that some siRNAs targeted to TATA-box sequences may block transcriptional inititation without causing epigenetic modifications to histones and DNA 67.",
              "Overall, these studies illustrate the important role of ncRNAs in modulating gene transcriptional silencing.",
              "It has been suggested that epigenetic changes may account for the missing heritability determinants of complex diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, that, to date, have not been accounted for by genetic studies of sequence variation 68, 69.",
              "In a recent study, the influence of parental origin on disease association was examined by following the inheritance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near known imprinted genes.",
              "These results identified 6 SNPs in which parental origin of a gene alters risk 70.",
              "One of these SNPs that was associated with type 2 diabetes correlated directly with methylation status, as well.",
              "Thus, these findings suggest that additional, nonsequence-dependent variations may contribute to heritable traits.",
              "Below we review the relationships between epigenetics and genetics, epigenetics and nutrition, and how these relationships may influence cardiovascular disease.",
              "Theoretically, SNPs that create CpG sites may be targets for epigenetic modifications, just as loss of these sites will prevent DNA methylation.",
              "The consequences of a polymorphism resulting in a CpG in the promoter region of the NDUFB6 gene illustrates this intersection between genetic and epigenetic regulation.",
              "NDUFB6 is a respiratory chain protein with diminished expression in type 2 diabetes.",
              "In muscle biopsies from elderly patients, NDUFB6 expression inversely correlates with the degree of DNA methylation, suggesting that the presence of a CpG site confers more risk for decreased expression (and potentially disease risk) than not having the site 71.",
              "Taken together, these findings support the concept that epigenetic modifications can influence risk in complex diseases.",
              "Barker and colleagues hypothesized that environmental factors in crucial periods of early life (during fetal development, for instance) can influence risks for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases later in life.",
              "This concept is supported by a number of studies that have associated low birth weight in human populations with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (see for instance reviews 72, 73).",
              "For example, individuals prenatally exposed to famine during the Dutch Hunger Winter (1944\u201345) experienced higher prevalence of obesity and coronary heart disease as adults, when compared to adults born before or conceived after that period 74.",
              "In Barker\u2019s seminal work, it was found that low birth-weight babies who survived infancy had an increased risk of coronary heart disease later in life, and that increasing birth weight was associated with a graded decrease in risk 75.",
              "In addition, in utero exposure to hypercholesterolemia has been associated with higher incidence and accelerated progression of lesions in humans, rabbits, and mice 76, 77.",
              "Exposure to different behavioral patterns during early postnatal life has also been shown to influence epigenetic modifications in experimental animal models 78.",
              "Thus, it has been suggested that these long-lasting changes arise, at least in part, from epigenetically mediated alterations in gene expression that occur very early in life 79.",
              "Applying these concepts to human populations, it has recently been proposed that social and environmental stresses during development may influence epigenetic processes that contribute to the adult race-based US health disparities in diseases like hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and coronary heart disease 80.",
              "More recent studies in animal models have begun to characterize epigenetic modifications that are influenced by the intrauterine environment.",

              "Although two later reports failed to confirm these observations regarding global hypomethylation in patients with renal failure 111, 112, Ingrosso and colleagues work represents the first human study that causally linked Hcy with altered gene expression via DNA hypomethylation.",

              "Subsequent studies suggested a role for transcriptional suppression of cyclin A in mediating Hcy-induced endothelial cell growth inhibition 117, 118, and found that Hcy triggers transcriptional inhibition of cyclin A through demethylation of a specific CpG site located in the core promoter, viz.",
              ", on the cell-cycle dependent element (CDE).",
              "In addition, cyclin A promoter demethylation eliminates MeCP2 binding, which, in turn, impairs HDAC association, leading to an accumulation of acetylated H3 and H4.",
              "The authors concluded that the loss of DNA methylation in the CDE repressor site and the resulting chromatin remodeling increases chromatin accessibility to repressors, resulting in inhibition of cyclin A gene transcription.",
              "Of additional interest was the observation that a physiological concentration of plasma Hcy inhibits DNMT1 activity in this cell system, providing evidence that Hcy can directly modulate specific DNA methylation reactions.",
              "In other studies, Hcy was also shown to disrupt the growth of endothelial cells by downregulating fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) via an epigenetic mechanism involving transcriptional repression 119.",
              "Apparently, the FGF2 gene promoter encompasses a CpG island and, in contrast with the cyclin A example, the FGF2 gene was heavily methylatedat cytosine residues despite significant AdoHcy accumulation.",
              "Normal levels of FGF2 transcription were restored when the cells were simultaneouslyexposed to a DNA demethylating agent and Hcy.",
              "Taken together with other examples in the literature 108, 120\u2013122, these findings suggest that Hcy and AdoHcy accumulation can have complex effects on DNA methylation targets and their transcriptional potential.",
              "Increasing evidence indicates that alterations in lipid metabolism may play a role in vascular pathology associated with hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) 123\u2013126, and many studies suggest that epigenetics may play a role in these processes.",
              "For example, changes in DNA methylation have been suggested as a potential mechanism for altered apoA-I and apoA-IV gene expression in mice with HHcy 127, 128.",
              "In mice, both apoA-I and apoA-IV genes are contained within the apolipoprotein gene cluster on chromosome 9, and, notably, the cluster contains a CpG-rich regioncorresponding to the 3\u2032 flanking region of the apoA-I gene andthe 5\u2032 flanking region of the apoA-IV gene.",
              "Similarly, it has been shown that Hcy is significantly and inversely correlated with HDL-bound cholesterol and apoA-I in both human and murine models of HHcy 129.",
              "In murine primary hepatocyte cultures, cellular hypomethylation, induced by AdoHcy accumulation, was suggested as an explanation for the Hcy-induced inhibition of apoA-I protein synthesis 130;",
              "however, additional analysis indicated that Hcy regulation of apoA-I synthesis may also involve other, nonepigenetic mechanisms. Additional evidence for regulation of lipid biosynthesis by the epigenetic effects of Hcy was reported by Devlin and colleagues, who showed that a reduced methylation capacity (assessed by AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio) in liver from mice with mild or moderate HHcy was associated with hepatic changes in phospholipid species and impaired long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism that could be attributed, in part, to differential CpG methylation of genes involved in these pathways 131, 132.",
              "Taken together, these findings indicate that Hcy may influence gene expression by modulating epigenetic pathways.",
              "As discussed above, the list of potential modifiers of methylation is long, suggesting that there are still many questions yet unresolved about Hcy\u2019s effects on methylation, gene expression, and cardiovascular disease risk.",
              "The plasticity of certain epigenetic modifications can be followed throughout development and differentiation and in response to environmental stimuli.",
              "The fact that modifications can accumulate in aging is supported by studies in genetically identical monozygotic twins: younger twins were far more concordant in terms of the patterns of DNA methylation and histone acetylation than older twins, suggesting that these tags are acquired or modified over time 133.",
              "Thus, it seems possible that epigenetic modifications may be amenable to pharmacological interventions.",
              "For example, 5-azacytidine, a DNMT inhibitor, has been used to increase fetal hemoglobin production by causing hypomethylation of \u03b3-globin genes in sickle cell disease patients 134, and, as discussed above, methyl donor treatments (folate, glycine and betaine) can increase DNA methylation, altering gene expression.",
              "Recent studies have also reported a microRNA (microRNA-29b) that can cause global hypomethylation, by reducing the expression of DNMT enzymes 135.",
              "These approaches, however, are not specific and may have undesirable consequences on the expression of genes distinct from those of primary interest.",

              "To date, most epigenetic therapies have focused on modulating chromatin structure.",
              "For example, there has been a surge in the development of many class and isoform-selective HDAC-inhibitors 136, some of which may have utility in cancer, Huntingtons disease, sickle cell disease, or cardiovascular diseases 137, 138.",
              "The usefulness of these approaches, again, may depend on the ability of a target HDAC to modulate subsets of genes, rather than cause global changes.",
              "This goal may not be that unrealistic: sirt6, a sirtuin deacetylase, apparently coordinately regulates the expression of multiple glycolytic genes 139, suggesting a possible target through which to regulate cellular metabolism.",
              "In addition, the specific methylation/demethylation of CYP27B1 31 discussed above suggests novel mechanisms of regulating epigenetic tags at the DNA level by modulating proteins that mediate methylation switching.",
              "In addition siRNA-based methods may provide a targeted means to transcriptionally silence genes.",
              "Recent findings also suggest that this method may be adapted to provide long term (with epigenetic changes) or short term (without epigenetic changes) regulation of gene transcription, depending on the targeting site in the promoter;",
