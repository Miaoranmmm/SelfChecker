    "query": "What is the most effective way for individuals and society to address the issue of antibiotic resistance, and what are the potential consequences if this problem is not addressed?",
    "response": "That's a very important question. Antibiotic resistance is a serious global health threat that occurs when bacteria develop the ability to survive antibiotic treatment. This can make infections harder to treat and increase the risk of complications and death. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), antibiotic resistance is driven by several factors, such as misuse and overuse of antibiotics, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, poor infection prevention and control, and lack of awareness and knowledge[^4^].\n\nSome possible solutions to address antibiotic resistance include:\n\n- Using antibiotics only when prescribed by a doctor and following the instructions carefully.\n- Not sharing or using leftover antibiotics.\n- Practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently, covering coughs and sneezes, and avoiding contact with sick people.\n- Getting vaccinated against preventable diseases.\n- Supporting policies and programs that promote rational use of antibiotics and infection prevention and control.\n- Raising awareness and educating others about the dangers of antibiotic resistance.\n\nIf antibiotic resistance is not addressed, it could have devastating consequences for human health and society. Some of these consequences include:\n\n- More infections that are difficult or impossible to treat, such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, gonorrhea, and sepsis.\n- Increased risk of complications and death from common infections and minor injuries.\n- Longer hospital stays and higher healthcare costs.\n- Reduced effectiveness of other medical treatments that rely on antibiotics, such as surgery, chemotherapy, organ transplants, and dialysis.\n- Increased burden on the economy and development due to lost productivity and increased poverty.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial that everyone takes action to prevent and combat antibiotic resistance. Together, we can preserve the power of antibiotics for future generations.\ud83d\udc4f",

              "When used appropriately to treat bacterial infections, antibiotics generate private (individual) benefits by expediting infection clearance and recovery from associated illness, whilst also generating public benefits by reducing the spread of infection across the rest of the population (positive externalities).",
              "However, these public benefits are usually outweighed by the costs that fall on others who do not use them (negative externalities) \u2014 their use can select for bacteria with more resistance, hence eroding the effectiveness of future antibiotic use.",
              "In other words, using antibiotics consumes the global stock of antibiotic effectiveness, making antibiotics less beneficial to everyone who uses them.",
              "Additionally, antibiotics confer no benefits against viral infections (and indeed bacterial infections that are resistant to that antibiotic).",
              "Since there is usually uncertainty about the aetiology and susceptibility of an infection, patients may demand antibiotic prescriptions and their prescribers are often incentivised to respond to this demand whether it be for a bacterial or viral infection.",
              "Because self-interested antibiotic consumers have little motivation to conserve the global stock of antibiotic effectiveness, most of the recommended interventions to combat ABR are unlikely to succeed without government intervention at the national and international levels.",
              "Indeed, even when prescribers act as custodians for antibiotic consumption, they are predicted to prescribe antibiotics to patients even when they only have a small chance of benefit [8].",
              "To correct these market failures and align individual and societal interests, governments (and other healthcare funders such as donors and private insurers) may incentivise prudent antibiotic use through taxes, subsidies and regulations, and fund research in antibiotics and other technologies [9].",
              "However, the scale of these interventions needs to be calibrated to the size of the negative externality, such that it reflects the social value of prolonging antibiotic effectiveness.",

              "this heterogeneity is present even when restricting comparisons to studies of a particular organism within the hospital setting [18].",
              "Despite these issues in interpreting and quantifying the costs of ABR, none of the reviews provided detailed proposals of how the evidence gaps and study heterogeneities could be addressed in future studies.",
              "Indeed, a lack of certainty on the current and potential future economic burden of ABR, especially in low- and middle-income countries, has been recognised to have hindered international action [4].",
              "Several estimates have recently been made of the global ABR burden to present the case for investing in measures to combat ABR [7, 19, 20].",
              "These global estimates were performed largely independently of the hospital-based literature, relying instead on international surveillance databases that have been noted to suffer from representativeness issues, confounding and biasedness around attributable mortality and ABR prevalence as well as contestable costing assumptions [21].",
              "Furthermore, quantifying the economic burden of ABR on its own is of little value for decision-making unless it can inform estimates of the impact that different interventions can have on this burden.",
              "To overcome these evidence gaps, we present a conceptual framework that can act as a roadmap for future studies to describe how they can reduce bias and be extended in time, perspective, scope and space.",

              "Previous reviews [11,12,13,14,15] have highlighted methodological shortcomings in the ABR cost literature, including heterogeneity in methodological choices [11, 14, 15], biases in study design and analysis [11, 14], lack of evidence outside high-income [12, 15] and hospital [12, 13] settings, and failure to consider the future consequences of ABR [13].",
              "We used these critiques to develop a conceptual framework of how current studies could be strengthened and extended to address these shortcomings.",
              "This was supplemented by additional deductive epidemiological and economic reasoning.",
              "The deductive reasoning was guided by the literature on causal inference [14, 22,23,24,25,26], perspective and scope of economic impact [27], and opportunity costs [28].",

              "Similar to previous reviews [12,13,14,15, 22], we found that most studies focused solely on treatment costs incurred by hospital patients with antibiotic-resistant infections, using one of two designs: A matched cohort design, where patients with antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-susceptible infections (or no infection at all) are matched and their cost outcomes compared.",
              "Matching is based on patient characteristics and differs widely across studies;",
              "some have matched only on patient age and gender, while others have used diagnostic codes, severity-of-illness scores or length of stay from admission to infection onset.",

              "Regression on a patient cohort to link the presence of an antibiotic-resistant infection with cost-related explanatory variables.",
              "In both cases, the outcome variable is treatment costs (calculated using hospital charges and/or standard reimbursement tariffs) or an intermediate outcome such as length of stay, which is then used to calculate costs.",
              "The latter approach may underestimate costs by ignoring other cost elements that may be greater for antibiotic-resistant infections such as testing and prescription costs, management of complications, and isolation ward and intensive care stays [18].",
              "Many studies suffer from methodological shortcomings that may either underestimate or overestimate of the actual cost of ABR, as has been pointed out previously [14, 17, 23].",
              "These shortcomings include (1) unmeasured baseline confounding (not adjusting for differences in the characteristics of patients with antibiotic-resistant, antibiotic-susceptible or no infection that affect their clinical outcomes or treatment costs), (2) time-dependent confounding (patients with antibiotic-resistant, antibiotic-susceptible or no infections have different changes to their characteristics such as health between the time of admission and acquiring an infection) [24, 25], (3) time-dependent bias (patients with longer stays being more likely to acquire antibiotic-resistant infections) [25], and (4) model misspecification (use of inappropriate models to relate variables to outcomes, such as the use of Cox regression models even though the proportional hazards assumption is rarely valid for cost outcomes) [26].",
              "The literature in this area has shown methodological improvements over time, with greater use of techniques that can correct for time-dependent biases, such as survival models incorporating infection as a time-dependent predictor and multi-state models [29].",
              "However, few studies adjust for potential time-varying confounding when focusing on hospital-acquired cases, using g-methods such as marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting [25] or nested g-formulae [24].",
              "In contrast to standard regression methods and multistate models, g-methods can provide unbiased estimates of an exposure if there is time-varying confounding that is also affected by the exposure, provided that confounding is accurately measured.",
              "The use of regression and propensity score matching rather than paired cohorts has also increased, which should reduce residual confounding since paired cohorts can only control for a limited selection of variables.",
              "Instrumental variable approaches may offer a more powerful approach to correct for observable and unobservable confounders [22].",
              "However, none of the reviewed studies used suitable instruments.",
              "It may be possible to use rapid policy shifts, such as changes to hospital cleaning regimens, as instruments, but these shifts would need to be sufficiently large and may be confounded by other time trends.",
              "A major limitation of hospital-based studies is that, on their own, they are insufficient to fully capture ABR economic burden on a national or global level or to assess the impact of interventions against the development of ABR.",

              "A few studies have taken scenario-based approaches by (1) assuming that future ABR prevalence and/or disease prevalence will increase by arbitrary amounts simply to explore what the consequences of such scenarios would be [7, 19, 20], (2) assuming that all currently susceptible bacterial strains will acquire ABR in the future [33], or (3) linearly projecting past data on disease incidence and ABR prevalence [31, 32].",
              "Even the most extreme scenarios may not represent the worst case, because these projections do not account for new resistances that bacteria may acquire, including resistance to current last-resort antibiotics.",
              "If this happens, then the cost of developing new antibiotics or antibiotic classes needs to be incorporated.",
              "Otherwise, some analysts have speculated that hospital procedures, such as organ transplantation and cancer chemotherapy, will become risky to perform because of untreatable infections.",
              "Approaches to costing such scenarios have been discussed [16, 19, 34], but no study has presented quantitative results of such calculations.",

              "One such perspective is that of the patient\u2019s household.",
              "If ABR results in longer hospital stays and more complex procedures, then this may increase household out-of-pocket costs such as co-payments for treatment, transport costs, caregiver accommodation costs and childcare costs.",

              "none of the reviewed papers considered these distributional perspectives.",
              "Such distributional concerns should also be considered in the use of interventions to correct for market failures in antibiotic use.",
              "For instance, taxing antibiotics may particularly burden the poor since the demand for antibiotics is relatively income inelastic [36];",
              "therefore, compensatory measures may be appropriate such as funding healthcare services and improvements in infection prevention strategies that will reduce the overall need for antibiotics [10].",
              "A further dimension of household economic burden is the value of avoiding pain, suffering and worry to patients and caregivers, including the value of avoiding premature mortality.",
              "In economic evaluations, this is usually done by either (1) monetising this value by eliciting people\u2019s willingness to pay to avoid morbidity and mortality or (2) valuing it using a separate metric such as quality- or disability-adjusted life years.",
              "As an example, Phelps [37] costed each avoided death as having a value of US$1 m (2 m in 2017 I$).",
              "Capturing household and psychosocial aspects of ABR burden is especially important in low- and middle-income settings where treatment costs and hospitalisation rates may be lower (due to low labour costs and poor healthcare access, respectively), but the human cost of ABR remains high.",

              "These effects can be translated into costs [16], although no paper we reviewed has done this explicitly.",
              "By considering only the incremental cost of treating antibiotic-resistant infections compared to antibiotic-susceptible infections, most studies imply that, even if ABR was eliminated, patients would still be infected by a susceptible infection.",
              "However, bacterial transmission is often driven by the ineffectiveness or slow effectiveness of antibiotic treatment, causing antibiotic-susceptible strains to spread more slowly;",

              "Game-theoretic analyses suggest that optimal antibiotic allocation requires cooperation between countries rather than allowing individual patients or even countries to act in their own self-interest [44].",
              "Only 18/110 of the reviewed studies (of which only 7 were published before 2018) and a further 4 studies found in the grey literature extrapolated findings from study sites to countries or multi-country groupings (Table 1).",
              "The most common approach is to multiply incremental costs in study sites by the total number of antibiotic-resistant cases across the entire geography.",
              "The shortcoming of this approach is that data from a single hospital or even several hospitals often lack external validity [32].",
              "Quantitative comparisons of the literature have found substantial differences in costs between studies [11, 17, 22].",
              "Another approach is to synthesise information from multiple studies as was done in cross-European analyses [6].",

              "A separate approach has been to rely on national [48, 52, 53, 55] or global [19, 20] surveillance databases rather than individual sites.",
              "This offers greater external validity but may only be accurate in countries with representative patient data on healthcare utilisation, prescribing and antibiotic susceptibility, ideally linked to account for dependencies in these variables.",
              "The validity of global antibiotic use databases has been questioned, particularly in resource-poor settings, given the difficulty of capturing antibiotic supply from informal providers [58, 59].",
              "Furthermore, cultures are less frequently taken in resource-poor settings and often only when patients do not seem to respond to empirical antibiotic therapy, leading to inflated estimates of ABR prevalence [59].",
              "A better approach may be to estimate ABR costs using large prospective population-based or multi-centre studies where antibiotic susceptibility is tested in all patients seeking healthcare for acute infections.",
              "When patient-level data are not available, studies have related ABR with costs on an ecological level (by subnational region [60, 61] or country [35]).",
              "The usual approach is to linearly regress the proportion of isolates that are resistant with healthcare expenditure (alongside other explanatory variables) [35, 60].",
              "In some cases, an intermediate outcome, such as overall pathogen prevalence [61], is the primary outcome variable, which is then converted into costs.",
              "While most studies have focused on the overall ABR economic burden, some have examined the impact and cost-effectiveness of interventions that could potentially affect ABR.",
              "Most of these consider ABR alone as an exogeneous factor affecting the cost-effectiveness of an intervention but not itself influenced by the intervention.",
              "For instance, many cost-effectiveness evaluations of antibiotics have incorporated the effect of ABR on the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment [62] or the types of antibiotics that can be used [63].",
              "Similarly, cost-effectiveness studies of interventions to reduce antibiotic consumption (such as stewardship programmes and rapid diagnostic tests) have typically considered intervention impact on antibiotic volume and costs.",
              "However, few studies have considered the potential impact of antibiotic consumption on (1) reducing ABR by preventing onward transmission of a bacteria susceptible to the antibiotic (positive externality) and/or (2) inducing ABR by increasing selective pressure (negative externality).",
              "Some studies have captured these externalities using descriptive statistical approaches such as (1) using empirical data to evaluate the impact of a discrete intervention affecting antibiotic consumption (such as introduction of a stewardship programme) on ABR prevalence or treatment cost [64];",
              "(2) estimating a fixed ratio between antibiotic consumption and ABR costs (or an intermediate proxy such as ABR prevalence or hospital bed-days used to treat infection with a particular pathogen) [54];",
              "or (3) fitting a statistical model, such as linear correlation between antibiotic consumption and ABR costs (or an intermediate proxy), using data sampled over several countries and/or years [52].",
              "These methods require an estimate of ABR costs.",
              "In hospital studies, this can be estimated as the cost of treating resistant infections in the hospital [64].",
              "In ecological studies, ABR costs are often regarded as the cost of all antibiotics consumed in a single country and year [50, 65].",
              "The most sophisticated methods derive from work by Phelps [37], who explicitly modelled market dynamics between antibiotic producers and consumers as well as the relationship between antibiotic consumption and the emergence of ABR.",
              "This was then used to estimate the total negative externality of annual antibiotic use in the USA, defined as the welfare loss due to ABR minus the welfare benefits that come from using antibiotics.",
              "This model was independently extended by Elbasha [47] and Kaier [66,67,68].",
              "All the above methods make major simplifying assumptions, as described below: Some models assume that resistance against a particular antibiotic is only affected by the use of antibiotics of the same class.",
              "In practice, antibiotic use can affect ABR against an antibiotic of a different class.",
              "For instance, amoxicillin, which is typically prescribed for respiratory tract infections, is associated with increased trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin resistance in Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections [69, 70].",
              "Conversely, higher nitrofurantoin use was found to be associated with lower levels of trimethoprim and amoxicillin resistance, potentially due to collateral sensitivity or a negative correlation between resistance genes [69].",
              "Models relating (human) antibiotic consumption to ABR assume that the relationship is not confounded by between-country differences such as in infection prevention and control measures and agricultural antibiotics use.",
              "Reverse causality could play a role in cross-sectional data since physicians may avoid a particular antibiotic if ABR to that antibiotic is known to be high in that population [71].",
              "In some cases, the potential role of reverse causality could be assessed using structural equation models or instrumental variables.",
              "Some models assume that the relationship is instantaneous, i.",
              "e. that a given level of antibiotic use will immediately result in some level of ABR.",
              "In practice, bacteria take time to acquire resistant genes and reach a new equilibrium prevalence in a population.",
              "Indeed, high levels of ABR may be the cumulative effect of years of antibiotic use, i.",
              "e. present antibiotic use may be depleting the health and wellbeing of future generations [72].",
              "Furthermore, future changes in ABR can be unpredictable.",
              "While the emergence of mutations conferring ABR to certain antibiotics is predictable to some extent, the timing and impact of the introduction of new ABR genes into mobile genetic elements or widespread bacterial strains is not [10, 73].",
              "Models often assume that the relationship between antibiotic use and ABR is linear (or can be described with a simple function);",
              "this has some basis in ecological observations at the national level [74].",
              "However, investigators using non-linear models suggest that the relationship is more complex and dynamic [3, 75, 76].",
              "Advanced modelling approaches may circumvent some but not all of these limitations.",
              "Time-series approaches to modelling the relationship between population antibiotic use and ABR in hospitals suggest that this relationship is indeed non-linear [77].",
              "Furthermore, machine learning approaches, such as boosted regression trees, can also be used, allowing flexibility in the functional relationship [70].",
              "Dynamic effects, such as time delays and feedback loops, can be captured with transmission dynamic models [45, 78], dynamic Bayesian Markov models [79] or by including lagged covariates into regression analysis.",
              "Transmission dynamic models capture the effect of interventions on onward transmission and competition between susceptible and resistant bacterial strains, and can be used to track changes in ABR prevalence over time.",
              "Transmission dynamic models with strain competition that incorporate economic outcomes are rare [45, 78, 80];",
              "one reason is that such models require data on antibiotic use in different settings, acquisition and carriage (duration) of antibiotic resistant bacteria, environmental swabs, movement of patients and contact patterns, rates of infection, and the associated current and future impact on patient outcomes and costs in order to predict the impact of interventions on ABR and the associated costs.",
              "However, some of them note that predictions about optimal policy may differ when economic considerations are incorporated into purely epidemiological/ecological models [3].",
              "A key issue around all models is the reversibility of ABR, i.",
              "e. whether susceptible strains will eventually outcompete resistant strains when reducing selective pressure from antibiotic use.",
              "Most ABR mechanisms come with fitness costs that reduce the competitiveness of resistant strains compared to susceptible strains in the absence of antibiotic exposure [68].",
              "However, reductions in antibiotic prescribing have not always led to reductions in ABR prevalence, potentially due to a lack of fitness costs, compensatory mutations that reduce fitness costs, and co-selection of ABR genes by other antibiotics.",
              "The reversibility of ABR likely depends on the setting, the bacterial species and on whether overall antibiotic use is reduced or one antibiotic is simply replaced by another [81].",
              "Models that assume that ABR is not reversible effectively model antibiotic effectiveness as a non-renewable resource [3, 78];",
              "these models aim to find strategies that obtain the greatest value from antibiotics before their effectiveness in exhausted.",
              "While the number of studies that estimate the cost of ABR is rapidly accumulating, the majority of published studies still ignore several biases and have too narrow a focus to estimate the true cost of ABR.",
              "For example, we found no studies that adjusted for time-dependent confounding using an appropriate methodology when estimating the costs attributable to hospital-onset resistant infections nor any studies that examined the impact that future levels of ABR may have on clinical pathways.",
              "Completely ignoring time-dependent confounding likely leads to overestimation of the impact of ABR in the hospital setting given that patients that develop an ABR infection have likely deteriorated further between admission and acquisition than patients who remain infection free [23].",
              "Attempting to correct for time-varying confounding using inappropriate methodology, such as standard regression techniques or multi-state models, may only partly remove the indirect effects of early infection that are mediated through the considered confounders, and may also introduce collider-stratification bias, which can lead to either an over- or underestimation of the true effect [14, 23, 26].",
              "We also found few studies capturing wider costs beyond hospital treatment costs (such as productivity costs, out-of-pocket expenses, opportunity costs of lost bed days and inability to use antibiotics, and costs associated with the value of avoiding suffering), and few studies in low- and middle-income settings.",
              "Consequently, it is likely that most studies have overestimated current ABR costs in the hospital setting (because of incomplete control for biases and confounding) but underestimated total ABR costs (because of failure to account for wider societal costs and future consequences of ABR).",
              "Lastly, we found a variety of approaches to costing, in line with previous reviews that concluded that heterogeneities in the quality of applied methods in ABR cost studies prevented meaningful comparisons [11, 14, 16,17,18].",
              "To address the limitations of existing studies, we have developed a conceptual framework to highlight the ideal scope and approaches for ABR cost estimations (Fig.",
              "2).",
              "We recognise that an analysis that is robust and comprehensive according to this framework likely cannot be conducted at this time due to limitations in both data and analytical methods.",
              "Hence, our framework points to the need for better primary studies and surveillance to inform the development of more methodologically robust models of ABR costs.",
              "In Table 2, we outline some recommendations for the field.",
              "The framework was informed by a narrative review of approaches and limitations that studies have taken to costing ABR.",
              "A narrative review aims to interpret and critique a large body of literature on a broad question, rather than summarise or synthesise literature on a narrowly focused topic [82].",
              "In this case, it was appropriate because the question we are addressing is wide ranging, approaches to it are still being developed and the literature we reviewed is varied, including commentaries, primary data collection studies, economic evaluations and conceptual models.",
              "The narrative review was informed by a rapid literature search to obtain a broad overview of the methods used by relevant papers, combined with a review of references from previous reviews.",
              "The rapid methodological review found 110 relevant studies, far more than any other review of the topic in the literature.",
              "Nevertheless, the review methodology we used was not as exhaustive or unbiased as a full systematic review.",
              "In particular, the search terms and range of databases we searched were relatively limited because of the large number of relevant articles.",
              "Our conceptual framework builds on gaps identified in current ABR estimates as well as on issues that have been previously discussed or that were considered important based on our own experience.",
              "Therefore, it is not an exhaustive list of all issues that could be encountered when estimating the costs of ABR.",
              "There is a clear need for more accurate estimates of the current and future costs attributable to ABR to inform decision-making around justified levels of investment in interventions that address the challenge of increasing ABR.",
              "Substantial improvements in methodological rigour and extension in time, perspective, scope and space are needed to capture the true costs of ABR in future studies.",
              "Furthermore, because better models cannot overcome data limitations, investment in prospective data collection is needed, including measurement of all relevant potential (time-varying) confounders as well as data on ABR infections and their associated costs and health consequences.",
              "This is particularly true in low-income settings where there is currently a clear lack of reliable data.",
              "Such studies need careful a priori consideration of potential confounders and biases.",
