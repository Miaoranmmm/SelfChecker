    "query": "What is the process and criteria for selecting which books are banned in certain countries, and how do these decisions reflect the political and social values of the governing bodies?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and complex question. Book censorship is the act of banning a publication in the form of a book resulting from content that is perceived to be objectionable, incendiary, illicit, or immoral by the presiding governmental body of a specific country or nation[^4^]. A book can be banned for one or more of the following reasons: racial issues, encouragement of \u201cdamaging\u201d lifestyles, blasphemous dialog, sexual situations or dialog, violence or negativity, presence of witchcraft, religious affiliations (unpopular religions), political bias, or age inappropriateness[^1^]. Book banning is the most widespread form of censorship in the United States, with children\u2019s literature being the primary target[^2^]. The process and criteria for selecting which books are banned may vary depending on the country, the level of government, the type of institution (such as school or library), and the nature of the challenge. In some cases, there may be formal procedures and guidelines for reviewing and deciding on book bans, while in other cases, there may be arbitrary or subjective decisions made by individuals or groups. The decisions may reflect the political and social values of the governing bodies, but they may also be influenced by external factors such as public opinion, media attention, pressure groups, or legal challenges. Book bans may have different impacts on different communities and individuals, depending on their access to alternative sources of information and their ability to exercise their right to free expression and critical inquiry[^2^].",

              "Though book banning as we know it today primarily focuses on attempts to keep certain works of fiction out of the hands of impressionable children and young adults, the first recorded instances of this censorship practice in Colonial America centered on objections to religious and political texts deemed too dangerous for the general public.",
              "Early examples include New English Canaan by Thomas Morton (1637), The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption by William Pynchon (1650) and The Christian Commonwealth by John Eliot (1659).",
              "This form of censorship continued throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, perhaps most famously as a reaction to the publication of Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s 1852 novel about the cruelties of slavery and the first American work of fiction to become an international bestseller.",
              "Widely banned in the American South for being \u201cabolitionist propaganda\u201d at the time of its release, Stowe\u2019s book continues to be challenged in the United States today for other reasons, like its inclusion of racial slurs.",
              "Roughly two decades after the controversy surrounding Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, Congress passed the Comstock Act of 1873, which made it illegal for anyone to possess, sell, give away, exhibit or send obscene books, pamphlets, pictures, drawings or advertisements through the mail, along with anything else considered lewd, lascivious, immoral or indecent.",
              "Between 1874 and 1915, an estimated 3,500 people were prosecuted under this law, although only about 350 were convicted.",

              "There has been significant pushback from individuals, publications and groups like the ALA and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), all with the view that book banning is a violation of our First Amendment rights.",
              "And many argue that whether they\u2019re classic books or more modern works, banned books are actually some of the best books for people to read, because they offer new perspectives and insights from people with life experiences different from our own.",

              "Or are there parts of the country where once a book is targeted, it's sort of forever targeted?",

              "But we definitely see some that kind of fall out and become kind of laughing stock.",
              "So the classic example is \"Harry Potter.\"",
              "You know, \"Harry Potter\" from probably about '98 to 2002 was the most challenged book series in the country.",
              "And today there's still some people who hold those views, but \"Harry Potter\" is still enormously popular.",
              "But, you know, we don't see that many challenges because the arguments look a little goofy to a lot of us.",
              "So the arguments were things like it's promoting paganism.",
              "But most of the time, I would say books kind of fall off, not because they get acceptance with the people who challenge them or even mainstream society, but because something else comes along.",
              "And so the one of the things I stress when people ask me about the change from 2019 to 2020 is, well, does that mean, you know, LGBT-inclusive books are becoming more accepted?",
              "I was like, no (laughter).",

              "This report offers an update on the count in PEN America\u2019s previous report, Banned in the USA: Rising School Book Bans Threaten Free Expression and Students\u2019 First Amendment Rights (April 2022), which covered the first nine months of the school year (July 2021 to March 2022).",
              "It also sheds light on the role of organized efforts to drive many of the bans.",
              "Many Americans may conceive of challenges to books in schools in terms of reactive parents, or those simply concerned after thumbing through a paperback in their child\u2019s knapsack or hearing a surprising question about a novel raised by their child at the dinner table.",
              "However, the large majority of book bans underway today are not spontaneous, organic expressions of citizen concern.",
              "Rather, they reflect the work of a growing number of advocacy organizations that have made demanding censorship of certain books and ideas in schools part of their mission.",
              "The numbers in this report represent documented cases of book bans reported directly to PEN America and/or covered in the media;",
              "there are likely additional bans that have not been reported.",
              "1In August, the Houston Chronicle released a report on the partisan nature of book bans in Texas between 2018 and 2021.",
              "The newspaper reported finding more than 1,000 bans in Texas during that time frame, which overlaps only in part with the time period covered by this report.",
              "That data was not available to review for inclusion in this report in advance of publication.",
              "PEN America estimates that at least 40 percent of bans listed in the Index (1,109 bans) are connected to either proposed or enacted legislation, or to political pressure exerted by state officials or elected lawmakers to restrict the teaching or presence of certain books or concepts.",
              "PEN America has identified at least 50 groups involved in pushing for book bans across the country operating at the national, state or local levels.",
              "Of those 50 groups, eight have local or regional chapters that, between them, number at least 300 in total;",
              "some of these operate predominantly through social media.",
              "Most of these groups (including chapters) appear to have formed since 2021 (73 percent, or 262).",
              "These parent and community groups have played a role in at least half of the book bans enacted across the country during the 2021\u201322 school year.",
              "At least 20 percent of the book bans enacted in the 2021-22 school year could be directly linked to the actions of these groups, with many more likely influenced by them;",
              "in an additional approximately 30 percent of bans, there is some evidence of the groups\u2019 likely influence, including the use of common language or tactics.",
              "Over the 2021\u201322 school year, what started as modest school-level activity to challenge and remove books in schools grew into a full-fledged social and political movement, powered by local, state, and national groups.",
              "The vast majority of the books targeted by these groups for removal feature LGBTQ+ characters or characters of color, and/or cover race and racism in American history, LGBTQ+ identities, or sex education.",
              "This movement to ban books is deeply undemocratic, in that it often seeks to impose restrictions on all students and families based on the preferences of those calling for the bans and notwithstanding polls that consistently show that Americans of all political persuasions oppose book bans.",
              "And it is having multifaceted, harmful impacts: on students who have a right to access a diverse range of stories and perspectives, and especially on those from historically marginalized backgrounds who are watching their library shelves emptied of books that reflect and speak to them;",
              "on educators and librarians who are operating in some states in an increasingly punitive and surveillance-oriented environment with a chilling effect on teaching and learning;",
              "on the authors whose works are being targeted;",
              "and on parents who want to raise students in schools that remain open to curiosity, discovery, and the freedom to read.",
              "PEN America has identified at least 50 groups involved in pushing for book bans at the national, state, or local levels.",
              "This includes eight groups that have among them at least 300 local or regional chapters.",
              "PEN America has identified these chapters based on the national groups\u2019 own listings, by chapter or regional websites, and by their official chapter and regional group pages on Facebook.",
              "Insofar as we have been able to establish, there are at least another 38 state, regional, or community groups that do not appear to have formal affiliations with national organizations or with one another.",
              "These groups share lists of books to challenge, and they employ tactics such as swarming school board meetings, demanding newfangled rating systems for libraries, using inflammatory language about \u201cgrooming\u201d and \u201cpornography,\u201d and even filing criminal complaints against school officials, teachers, and librarians.",
              "The majority of these groups appear to have formed in 2021, and many of the banned books counted by PEN America can be linked in some way to their activities.",
              "Some of the groups espouse Christian nationalist political views, while many have mission statements oriented toward reforming public schools, in some cases to offer more religious education.",
              "In at least a few documented cases (for example, in Texas, Florida, and Pennsylvania), the individuals lodging complaints about books did not have children attending public schools when at the time they raised objections.",
              "This evolving censorship movement has grown in size and routinely finds new targets and tactics, homing in on the books encompassed in district book purchases or digital library apps.",
              "A parallel but connected movement is also targeting public libraries, with calls to ban books;",
              "efforts to intimidate, harass, or fire librarians;",
              "and even attempts to suspend or defund entire libraries.",
              "PEN America defines a school book ban as any action taken against a book based on its content and as a result of parent or community challenges, administrative decisions, or in response to direct or threatened action by lawmakers or other governmental officials, that leads to a previously accessible book being either completely removed from availability to students, or where access to a book is restricted or diminished.",
              "It is important to recognize that books available in schools, whether in a school or classroom library, or as part of a curriculum, were selected by librarians and educators as part of the educational offerings to students.",
              "Book bans occur when those choices are overridden by school boards, administrators, teachers, or even politicians, on the basis of a particular book\u2019s content.",
              "School book bans take varied forms, and can include prohibitions on books in libraries or classrooms, as well as a range of other restrictions, some of which may be temporary.",
              "Book removals that follow established processes may still improperly target books on the basis of content pertaining to race, gender, or sexual orientation, invoking concerns of equal protection in education.",
              "For more details, please see the first edition of Banned in the USA (April 2022).",
              "Since PEN America published our initial Banned in the USA: Rising School Book Bans Threaten Free Expression and Students\u2019 First Amendment Rights (April 2022) report, tracking 1,586 book bans during the nine-month period from July 2021 to March 2022, details about 671 additional banned books during that period have come to light.",
              "A further 275 more banned books followed from April through June, bringing the total for the 2021-22 school year to 2,532 bans.",
              "This book-banning effort is continuing as the 2022\u201323 school year begins too, with at least 139 additional bans taking effect since July 2022.",
              "In addition to the role played in book banning by local, state, and national groups, efforts to restrict access to books were also advanced in the past year by government officials and enabled by both state-level legislation and district-level policy changes.",
              "PEN America estimates that at least 40 percent of the bans counted in the Index of School Book Bans for the 2021\u201322 school year are connected to political pressure exerted by state officials or elected lawmakers.",
              "Some officials for example sent letters specifically inquiring into the availability of certain books in schools, such as occurred in Texas, Wisconsin, and South Carolina.",
              "Since March 2022, we have also seen for the first time educational gag orders passed that implicate restrictions on books, most notably in Florida, as well as a range of other new laws that have put pressure on schools to censor their libraries.",
              "The Alpine School District in Utah responded to a new law, HB 374 (\u201cSensitive Materials in Schools\u201d), by announcing the removal of 52 titles in July, but then opted to keep the books on shelves with some restrictions after national pushback.",
              "In August, some school districts in St.",
              "Louis, Missouri began to pull books from shelves in response to a law that made it a class A misdemeanor to provide visually explicit sexual material to students.",
              "These trends are unfortunately likely to continue, as the chilling effect of these legislative measures spreads.",
              "Altogether, this report paints a deeply concerning picture for access to literature, and diverse literature in particular, in schools in the coming school year.",
              "Book banning and educational gag orders are two fronts in an all-out war on education and the open discussion and debate of ideas in America.",
              "Students have First Amendment rights to access information and ideas in schools, and these bans and legislative shifts pose clear threats to those rights.",
              "This climate is also increasingly undermining the professional discretion of educators and librarians when it comes to matters of public education, and disrupting the potential for effective relationships between parents, teachers and administrators that can actually serve to advance student learning and civic engagement.",
              "Students retain their First Amendment rights in schools.",

              "What does this mean for districts who receive a request to reconsider a library holding?",
              "Legal precedent and expert best practices demand that committee members, and principals, superintendents, and school boards act with the constitutional rights of students in mind, and using established processes, cognizant of the harm in eliminating access for all based on the concerns of any individual or faction.",

              "PEN America CEO Suzanne Nossel on book bans for PBS NewsHour, March 10, 2022.",
              "In total, PEN America\u2019s Index of School Book Bans tracked 2,532 decisions to ban books between July 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022.",
              "This includes bans on 1,648 unique banned book titles.",
              "The banning of a single book title could mean anywhere from one to hundreds of copies are pulled from libraries or classrooms in a school district, and often, the same title is banned in libraries, classrooms, or both in a district.",
              "PEN America does not count these duplicate book bans in its unique title tally, but does acknowledge each separate ban in its overall count.",
              "In some cases, books are removed from shelves pending investigations or reviews, and they may be only temporarily restricted, but their restriction is recorded in the Index as a ban since such restrictions are counter to procedural best practices for book challenges from the American Library Association (ALA) and the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC).",
              "Detailed definitions can be found in the first edition of Banned in the USA (April 2022).",
              "PEN America\u2019s recent findings on each type of ban for the 2021-22 school year are listed below.",
              "Beginning in 2021, a range of individuals and groups sought to remove from schools books focused on issues of race or the history of slavery and racism, mirroring a campaign pushed by some legislators to pass educational gag orders\u2014bills restricting discussion of these and other concepts in school classrooms and curricula.",
              "Although the campaign to enact educational gag orders initially focused on misapplications of the academic term \u201ccritical race theory\u201d to censor discussions of race and racism, over the past year, it morphed to include a heightened focus on LGBTQ+ issues and identities.",
              "Similar trends \u2014 and similar rhetoric and reasoning \u2014 have been evident in efforts to ban books in schools as they have expanded since 2021, too.",
              "Complaints about diversity and inclusion efforts have accompanied calls to remove books with protagonists of color, and numerous banned books have been targeted for simply featuring LGBTQ+ characters.",
              "Nonfiction histories of civil rights movements and biographies of people of color have been swept up in these campaigns.",
              "For example, many volumes in the popular Who Was?",
              "chapter book series and several biographies of Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor were banned in Central York School District in Pennsylvania.",
              "That ban also impacted hundreds of books with protagonists of color, including the Caldecott Honor\u2013winning A Big Mooncake for Little Star.",
              "In a similar example, Duval County Public Schools in Florida opted not to distribute sets of the Essential Voices Classroom Libraries collection of books after they had been purchased, flagged for concern over their content.",
              "This collection of 176 unique titles has been effectively banned from classrooms while it is being reviewed and reportedly remains in storage.",
              "Books in the collection include Fry Bread: A Native American Family Story by Kevin Noble Maillard, Dim Sum for Everyone by Grace Lin, and Pink Is For Boys by Robb Perlman, among other titles designed to make classroom libraries more diverse and inclusive.",

              "In other cases, districts followed policies that failed to afford full protection for freedom of expression\u2014for example, by restricting student access to books while they are under review, by failing to convene a committee to review the complaint, or by not having the complainant complete the paperwork or read the whole book to which they were objecting as required by the stated policies.",
              "In some communities where existing procedures are more aligned with the standards set forth in the ALA and NCAC guidelines, or where advocates for book banning have been stifled in their efforts, there have been new efforts to alter those policies and make the removal of books easier.",
              "Such efforts often include a drive to change the \u201cobscenity\u201d determination used to ban books\u2014usually without regard for the relevant legal standard.",
              "These changes have taken place in nearly a dozen districts, such as Frisco ISD in Texas, which in June revised its book policies to remove the existing standards of obscenity for materials and replace them with more stringent standards taken from the Texas Penal Code.",
              "In practice, this means that a sentence or image may be enough to get a book banned\u2014and that book content will be evaluated without proper context.",
              "The inevitable result of the Frisco ISD and similar changes will be increased policing of content in books for young people, as well as the continued erosion of their right to access these materials.",
              "Some policy changes have been advanced at the state level as well, with Texas leading the way.",
              "In April, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) announced new standards for how school districts should handle all content in their libraries.",
              "The Texas standards follow state representative Matt Krause\u2019s October 2021 public letter \u201cinitiating an inquiry into Texas school district content,\u201d as well as a public letter to the Texas Association of School Boards (TASB) from Gov.",
              "Greg Abbott in November 2021, asking schools to investigate why their libraries contained allegedly \u201cobscene\u201d and \u201cpornographic\u201d content in schools.",
              "Abbott did not provide any specific content examples.",
              "(It is worth noting that TASB has no power to change or even to recommend district policies.)",
              "The policy recommendations from the TEA, compiled in response to the public letter from Governor Abbott, implemented four significant process changes of note, none of which comport with accepted best practices.",
              "The changes include the following: While Texas has not made this policy mandatory for its school districts, the policy has begun to shape school library policies.",
              "By July 2022, at least two Texas school districts in Tarrant County had changed their acquisition policies based on the TEA\u2019s model policy.",
              "For example, now if a book is challenged and removed in Carroll ISD, Texas, that book cannot be requested again for students for five years.",
              "In Keller ISD, this provision was changed to ten years.",
              "The trend of district-level policy changes, which largely began in Texas, has picked up steam in other places too.",
              "For example, the school board in Hamilton County, Tennessee, accepted board policy recommendations from a special book review committee in March 2022, which removed a statement on the principles of intellectual freedom from the ALA\u2019s \u201cLibrary Bill of Rights.",
              "\u201d This was a striking departure from the norm, as up until this year, it was a generally accepted standard that school board policies concerning acquisitions management and curricular development would reference or otherwise incorporate principles put forth by the Office for Intellectual Freedom of the ALA.",
              "In another instance, Central Bucks County School District in Pennsylvania voted in July 2022 to reassign oversight of library collections from library and education professionals to a committee of the \u201csuperintendents designees\u201d\u2014politicizing a task previously performed by library and education professionals well versed in sound acquisition principles and policies.",
              "The district further undermined its education professionals by moving to refocus collection acquisition strategies away from instructional needs\u2014as determined by teachers, librarians, and other education professionals\u2014toward potentially politicized decisions, such as evaluating books for sexual content using vague standards to determine whether a book should be placed in the library.",
              "In so doing, the district ran afoul of NCAC guidelines to ensure practices that \u201cadvance fundamental pedagogical goals and not subjective interests.",
              "\u201d From Kansas to Illinois, Indiana to Virginia, North Carolina to Florida, myriad efforts to implement and enforce censorious practices are effectively allowing some parents and citizens to constrain the availability of books for all students in their and other school communities.",
              "A raft of changes are making it easier to ban more books more quickly, undermining educators\u2019 and librarians\u2019 work and ultimately students\u2019 rights to access information.",
              "Dozens of people read books on the lawn of the Nampa School District office at the same time as a meeting takes place inside to determine the disposal of books on its banned books list on Thursday, June 16, 2022, in Nampa, Idaho.",
              "The Nampa school board voted last month to remove several books from its libraries.",
              "(Sarah A.",
              "Miller/Idaho Statesman via AP) The unrelenting wave of challenges to the inclusion of certain books in school libraries\u2014whether promulgated at the urging of an individual community member, grassroots organization, or government official\u2014has spurred another phenomenon: preemptive book banning.",
              "In April, May, and June 2022, PEN America tracked several cases where school administrators have banned books in the absence of any challenge in their own district, seemingly in a preemptive response to potential bills, threats from state officials, or challenges in other districts.",
              "The most significant ban of this type occurred in Collierville, Tennessee, where a school district removed 327 books from shelves in anticipation of a state law that ultimately did not pass.",
              "Administrators sorted the books into tiers based on how much the books focus on LGBTQ+ characters or story lines;",
              "tier 3, for instance, reflected that \u201cthe main character of the book is part of the LGBTQ community, and their sexual identity forms a key component of the plot.",
              "The book may contain suggestive language and/or implied sexual interactions.",
              "\u201d If a book reached tier 5, according to the sorting guidelines, \u201cthe books are being pulled.",
              "\u201d Other preemptive bans were responses to actions at the state level or in neighboring districts.",
              "For example, according to Texas media reports, bans in Katy ISD, Clear Creek ISD, and Cypress-Fairbanks ISD were the result of administrators responding either to what was happening in other districts or to an 850-book list compiled and circulated to education officials by Texas state representative Matt Krause.",
              "Finally, PEN America has tracked other instances of books included in banned book displays, or other disputed materials, being quietly removed to avoid controversy.",
              "Books are also being labeled or marked in some way as \u201cinappropriate\u201d both in online catalogs and on physical titles themselves.",
              "In the Collier County School District in Florida, for instance, warning labels were attached to a group of more than 100 books that disproportionately included stories featuring LGBTQ+ characters and characters of color.",
              "While these cases are not included in the Index because they do not meet PEN America\u2019s definition of school book bans, these types of actions could have a chilling effect\u2014applying a stigma to the books in question and the topics they cover\u2014and they merit further study.",
              "While several stories of preemptive and silent book bans have made it into the news or to the attention of PEN America, it is clear that mounting censorship and the punitive approach being taken to the enforcement of book bans is having wide ripple effects.",
              "The Supreme Court has sharply restricted viewpoint- and subject-matter-based restrictions on speech precisely because in addition to rendering certain ideas, stories, and opinions off-limits, such measures cast a wider chilling effect on expression.",
              "Given the rapid spread of book bans across the country, it seems inevitable that the resulting climate of caution and fear will result in a reluctance among teachers, administrators, and librarians to take risks that could affect their own employment, their budgets, their reputations, and even their personal safety.",
              "Emerging data, like a recent survey of school librarians by the School Library Journal in which 97% said they \u201calways,\u201d \u201coften,\u201d or \u201csometimes\u201d weigh how controversial subject matter might be when deciding on book purchases is pointing clearly to these alarming trends.",
              "Beyond formal book bans, there have also been efforts to keep books out of the hands of children even if they remain in circulation.",
              "One prominent example of such activity was \u201cHide the Pride,\u201d an initiative of CatholicVote.",
              "org in June 2022.",
              "CatholicVote encouraged members to check out books from the Pride 2022 displays in children\u2019s sections of public libraries and to take pictures of the empty shelves.",
              "Although the group instructed participants to \u201creturn your library books on time\u201d and to follow the \u201cletter of the law, so to speak,\u201d Hide the Pride was an attempt to remove library materials from availability and to limit students\u2019 access to LGBTQ+-affirming books.",
              "In the same month, there were efforts to ban displays of LGBTQ+ materials entirely in some public libraries, such as in Smithtown, New York, and Lafayette Parish, Louisiana.",
              "The latter resulted in an effort to terminate a librarian for allegedly violating the prohibition.",
              "The unprecedented flood of book bans in the 2021\u201322 school year reflects the increasing organization of groups involved in advocating for such bans, the increased involvement of state officials in book-banning debates, and the introduction of new laws and policies.",
              "More often than not, current challenges to books originate not from concerned parents acting individually but from political and advocacy groups working in concert to achieve the goal of limiting what books students can access and read in public schools.",
              "As noted previously, the resulting harm is widespread, affecting pedagogy and intellectual freedom and placing limits on the professional autonomy of school librarians and teachers.",
              "The repercussions extend further, however, to the well-being of the students affected by these bans.",
              "Children deserve to see themselves in books, and they deserve access to a diversity of stories and perspectives that help them understand and navigate the world around them.",
              "Public schools that ban books reflecting diverse identities risk creating an environment in which students feel excluded, with potentially profound effects on how students learn and become informed citizens in a pluralistic and diverse society.",
              "Book challenges impede free expression rights, which must be the bedrock of public schools in an open, inclusive, and democratic society.",
              "These bans pose a dangerous precedent to those in and out of schools, intersecting with other movements to block or curtail the advances in civil rights for historically marginalized people.",
              "Against the backdrop of other efforts to roll back civil liberties and erode democratic norms, the dynamics surrounding school book bans are a canary in the coal mine for the future of American democracy, public education, and free expression.",
              "We should heed this warning.",

              "View All posts by Kelly Jensen A crucial tool for library workers is a strong, updated collection development policy.",
              "If it\u2019s been several years since visiting whatever is in place, it is more than worth it to pull it out and update it as your library continues to grow and evolve.",
              "It\u2019s vital to keep this updated all the time, but especially during a censorship friendly era, as a collection development policy lays the groundwork for the materials being selected and de-selected and offers patrons a guide to what they can or should expect.",
              "But in addition to a strong and current collection development policy, something each and every library needs is an up-to-date, solid challenge policy (also known as a reconsideration policy)/book challenge form.",
              "For decades, the American Library Association (ALA) has provided a reconsideration form template.",
              "It offers all of the basics, and gives those who wish to exercise their rights to contest material to do so.",
              "This is a good thing, not a bad thing.",
              "A healthy democracy encourages input from an array of individuals.",
              "But in an era of increased censorship with no anticipated cooling in sight, it\u2019s time that challenge forms and policies are overhauled across the country.",
              "The purpose of a challenge policy is to protect the professionals within an institution and to protect the rights of those whose tax money funds those institutions.",
              "Challenge policies uphold the First Amendment rights of all individuals while providing a formal avenue to address concerns in a uniform manner.",
              "This uniformity and consistency is important, as the leading reason for book bans in school libraries right now is a district either choosing not to follow or ignoring their policies for challenges all together.",
              "PEN America reports that only 11 school districts have followed their own policies consistently and that doing so reduced the number of books banned in those institutions.",
              "One of the weaknesses in ALA\u2019s template policy and discussion of book challenge policies more broadly is that it allows informal complaints.",
              "Informal complaints could be anything from showing up to a board meeting to read offending passages out loud to a parent telling a librarian they are disgusted by a particular title being available.",
              "These informal complaints are to be treated the same as a formal complaint.",
              "That leaves the door wide open to interpretation from individuals, as well as for administrative overreach (as has been seen again and again).",
              "All book challenges should require a formal complaint.",
              "These complaint forms should be easy to find and readily available to those who\u2019d like to use them.",
              "A good collection development policy portends a good challenge policy, and making both easily accessible shows confidence in not only those frameworks but also in upholding First Amendment rights.",
              "In a recent presentation, New Jersey librarian Martha Hickson highlighted the weaknesses in ALA\u2019s template reconsideration policy.",
              "She points out specifically that the template policy is nearly identical across some of the most high-profile book challenges in the US.",
              "And, for the most part, these forms don\u2019t expect much from those who file them.",
              "As we\u2019ve seen over and over, because so many of these challenges are coming from social media pushes or through book lists distributed to right-wing groups and organizations, all that\u2019s needed to do to file a form is print the images that have been shared, point to \u201cobscenity\u201d laws (or something similar), and demand the book be removed.",
              "Without updating their template form, ALA has not kept up with the current realities in school and public libraries.",
              "What should be included in a good challenge policy?",
              "Once you can articulate those things, then it\u2019s on to developing a formal challenge form.",
              "The form should include two parts \u2014 the first of which primarily follows ALA\u2019s template, while the second offers a deeper level of insight into what constitutes a problem with the material.",
              "Here\u2019s what that might look like: Begin with a short explanation of what the procedure is for challenging a book, the estimated cost of a challenge, and the timeline from form submission to decision.",
              "Be clear that only one form from a household is accepted at a time, and that material being challenged must be read in full.",
              "The form must also be completed in full.",
              "Include a line about the purpose of the library collection and its commitment to the rights of individuals to read and access materials they would like to is a fundamental principle of the institution.",
              "Part 1: The basic information.",
              "This looks like ALA\u2019s reconsideration request form with some adjustments.",
              "For \u201cno\u201d responses on the final question, no further action is needed.",
              "The resolution is simply that the material in question was not considered in full and therefore cannot be put through the reconsideration process.",
              "Part 2: Understanding the material being challenged.",
              "Much of this is adapted from librarian Martha Hickson\u2019s suggestions.",
              "Note here that incomplete responses or no responses to questions will void the form.",
              "All forms should require a signature at the bottom, indicating that the person who has filed the form understands the purpose of the library and that parents always have the right to educate their own children about the books that may be best for them.",
              "This book challenge form template is available to save, download, and modify.",
              "If you work in a library, update your challenge forms. If you aren\u2019t in a position to make those decisions, seek out those who are.",

              "People\u2019s perception of offensive content is not limited to the written word.",
              "Censorship beyond books can happen anywhere\u2014in private and public institutions, large school districts and small public libraries, rural universities, state prisons, and urban government buildings.",
              "The variety of resources and services challenged is just as broad, including films, videos, music, magazines, newspapers, games, internet access, databases, programs, use of meeting rooms, exhibits, displays, artwork, reading lists, and online resources.",
              "Here are three examples of censorship beyond books that could happen at your library.",
              "Almost every library has at least one database subscription that offers curated content published by reputable sources.",
              "The target audience and content vary widely among databases, and because databases are digital resources, users can access the content in various settings\u2014in the library, at school, and at home.",
              "These factors can cause confusion in determining whether content is appropriate and to whom concerns should be addressed.",
              "Does responsibility for content rest with the library, the library\u2019s parent organization (for example, the school district), or the database vendor?",
              "While most parents have directed their concerns to the school district, in some cases complaints are elevated to the level of elected officials, statewide systems, and even the courts.",
              "In September 2018, a parent in Tooele, Utah, claimed to have found inappropriate content in EBSCO\u2019s K\u201312 databases and complained directly to the Utah Education Network (UEN).",
              "UEN connects all Utah school districts, schools, and higher-education institutions with the goal of providing high-quality educational resources.",
              "After receiving the complaint, the network\u2019s board quickly voted to remove access to the K\u201312 EBSCO databases for every public school district in the state, potentially affecting more than 700,000 students.",
              "When trying to connect to the databases, users received this message: \u201cOngoing concerns about content prompted action.",
              "The Utah Education and Telehealth Network places a high priority on the safety and well-being of students and is taking additional action to address concerns about inappropriate content within EBSCO services for K\u201312 students.",
              "\u201d Many teachers did not know about the decision until students tried to use the databases for homework assignments.",
              "Teachers, librarians, and parents, with strategic assistance from multiple organizations, sent thousands of email messages and petition signatures to protest the ban and urge UEN\u2019s board to restore access to EBSCO.",
              "Then\u2013American Library Association (ALA) President Loida Garcia-Febo issued a letter, cosigned by the leadership of the American Association of School Librarians, the Association of College and Research Libraries, the Utah Educational Library Media Association, the National Council of Teachers of English, and the National Coalition against Censorship.",
              "Garcia-Febo wrote: \u201cBy committing to statewide access to EBSCO databases for all students, UEN [would be] committing to a quality, equitable education for all Utah students.",
              "\u201d At the board meeting and in the press, opponents of EBSCO\u2019s database continued to suggest that if the board reinstated access, it would be \u201cintentionally and knowingly\u201d distributing pornography to minors, though UEN could not substantiate their claims. Almost a month later, after public feedback, collaboration with EBSCO staff, and statements by multiple educational organizations, the board voted unanimously to restore the school districts\u2019 access to the K\u201312 databases.",
              "People raise concerns about library displays and programs for the same reasons they raise concerns about other types of library resources: objections to LGBTQ+ content, profanity, political viewpoints, sexual content, and religious content.",
              "In June, during ALA\u2019s Rainbow Book Month (formerly known as GLBT Book Month), libraries often receive complaints about displays that celebrate Pride Month or recognize LGBTQ+ history, or programs that acknowledge gender fluidity and diverse perspectives.",
              "Sometimes the request to dismantle a display comes from an administrator in a preemptive attempt to avoid controversy or to placate informal concerns raised by someone with power or influence.",
              "In Leander, Texas, a drag queen story hour was canceled by the city, and a local church used meeting space in the library to host its own Leander Family Pride Festival and Storytime.",
              "The security costs and a public outcry led to a review of the library\u2019s meeting room policy.",
              "The city council then changed the policy to limit meeting room use to city departments.",
              "During the policy review, another program was canceled: Leander Public Library had scheduled author Lilah Sturges to speak about writing and publishing her series Lumberjanes.",
              "The library administration told the transgender author that the event was canceled because she had not undergone a background check, but several other youth events were held in library meeting rooms without review by city officials.",
              "Community members have questioned whether this cancellation is another example of discrimination and censorship.",
              "The Selection and Reconsideration Policy Toolkit for Public, School, and Academic Libraries is an online resource that provides descriptions of and rationale for the basic components of a selection policy and provides detailed information about the informal and formal reconsideration of library resources.",
              "Each section includes brief explanations of specific factors to be considered for the library type.",
              "The toolkit is intended as guidance, and its policy language examples should be adapted to local situations and state laws.",
              "Sometimes the principal or library director does not follow policy and removes the challenged resource or cancels the event.",
              "If the administration refuses to follow the reconsideration process, even after discussing the legal and ethical reasons for doing so, how far should library workers go to defend the challenged item?",
              "This is a personal, ethical decision, and library workers must weigh all factors.",
              "If the director or principal is adamant, library workers may be forced to evaluate the risk of retaliation from their supervisor or losing a job against the merits of continuing to oppose the censorship attempt.",

              "If it\u2019s been several years since visiting whatever is in place, it is more than worth it to pull it out and update it as your library continues to grow and evolve.",
              "It\u2019s vital to keep this updated all the time, but especially during a censorship friendly era, as a collection development policy lays the groundwork for the materials being selected and de-selected and offers patrons a guide to what they can or should expect.",
              "But in addition to a strong and current collection development policy, something each and every library needs is an up-to-date, solid challenge policy (also known as a reconsideration policy)/book challenge form.",
              "For decades, the American Library Association (ALA) has provided a reconsideration form template.",
              "It offers all of the basics, and gives those who wish to exercise their rights to contest material to do so.",
              "This is a good thing, not a bad thing.",
              "A healthy democracy encourages input from an array of individuals.",
              "But in an era of increased censorship with no anticipated cooling in sight, it\u2019s time that challenge forms and policies are overhauled across the country.",
              "The purpose of a challenge policy is to protect the professionals within an institution and to protect the rights of those whose tax money funds those institutions.",
              "Challenge policies uphold the First Amendment rights of all individuals while providing a formal avenue to address concerns in a uniform manner.",
              "This uniformity and consistency is important, as the leading reason for book bans in school libraries right now is a district either choosing not to follow or ignoring their policies for challenges all together.",
              "PEN America reports that only 11 school districts have followed their own policies consistently and that doing so reduced the number of books banned in those institutions.",
              "One of the weaknesses in ALA\u2019s template policy and discussion of book challenge policies more broadly is that it allows informal complaints.",
              "Informal complaints could be anything from showing up to a board meeting to read offending passages out loud to a parent telling a librarian they are disgusted by a particular title being available.",
              "These informal complaints are to be treated the same as a formal complaint.",
              "That leaves the door wide open to interpretation from individuals, as well as for administrative overreach (as has been seen again and again).",
              "All book challenges should require a formal complaint.",

              "It also sheds light on the role of organized efforts to drive many of the bans.",
              "Many Americans may conceive of challenges to books in schools in terms of reactive parents, or those simply concerned after thumbing through a paperback in their child\u2019s knapsack or hearing a surprising question about a novel raised by their child at the dinner table.",
              "However, the large majority of book bans underway today are not spontaneous, organic expressions of citizen concern.",
              "Rather, they reflect the work of a growing number of advocacy organizations that have made demanding censorship of certain books and ideas in schools part of their mission.",
              "The numbers in this report represent documented cases of book bans reported directly to PEN America and/or covered in the media;",
              "there are likely additional bans that have not been reported.",

              "The newspaper reported finding more than 1,000 bans in Texas during that time frame, which overlaps only in part with the time period covered by this report.",
              "That data was not available to review for inclusion in this report in advance of publication.",
              "PEN America estimates that at least 40 percent of bans listed in the Index (1,109 bans) are connected to either proposed or enacted legislation, or to political pressure exerted by state officials or elected lawmakers to restrict the teaching or presence of certain books or concepts.",
              "PEN America has identified at least 50 groups involved in pushing for book bans across the country operating at the national, state or local levels.",
              "Of those 50 groups, eight have local or regional chapters that, between them, number at least 300 in total;",
              "some of these operate predominantly through social media.",
              "Most of these groups (including chapters) appear to have formed since 2021 (73 percent, or 262).",
              "These parent and community groups have played a role in at least half of the book bans enacted across the country during the 2021\u201322 school year.",
              "At least 20 percent of the book bans enacted in the 2021-22 school year could be directly linked to the actions of these groups, with many more likely influenced by them;",
              "in an additional approximately 30 percent of bans, there is some evidence of the groups\u2019 likely influence, including the use of common language or tactics.",
              "Over the 2021\u201322 school year, what started as modest school-level activity to challenge and remove books in schools grew into a full-fledged social and political movement, powered by local, state, and national groups.",
              "The vast majority of the books targeted by these groups for removal feature LGBTQ+ characters or characters of color, and/or cover race and racism in American history, LGBTQ+ identities, or sex education.",
              "This movement to ban books is deeply undemocratic, in that it often seeks to impose restrictions on all students and families based on the preferences of those calling for the bans and notwithstanding polls that consistently show that Americans of all political persuasions oppose book bans.",
              "And it is having multifaceted, harmful impacts: on students who have a right to access a diverse range of stories and perspectives, and especially on those from historically marginalized backgrounds who are watching their library shelves emptied of books that reflect and speak to them;",
              "on educators and librarians who are operating in some states in an increasingly punitive and surveillance-oriented environment with a chilling effect on teaching and learning;",
              "on the authors whose works are being targeted;",
              "and on parents who want to raise students in schools that remain open to curiosity, discovery, and the freedom to read.",
              "PEN America has identified at least 50 groups involved in pushing for book bans at the national, state, or local levels.",
              "This includes eight groups that have among them at least 300 local or regional chapters.",
              "PEN America has identified these chapters based on the national groups\u2019 own listings, by chapter or regional websites, and by their official chapter and regional group pages on Facebook.",
              "Insofar as we have been able to establish, there are at least another 38 state, regional, or community groups that do not appear to have formal affiliations with national organizations or with one another.",
              "These groups share lists of books to challenge, and they employ tactics such as swarming school board meetings, demanding newfangled rating systems for libraries, using inflammatory language about \u201cgrooming\u201d and \u201cpornography,\u201d and even filing criminal complaints against school officials, teachers, and librarians.",
              "The majority of these groups appear to have formed in 2021, and many of the banned books counted by PEN America can be linked in some way to their activities.",
              "Some of the groups espouse Christian nationalist political views, while many have mission statements oriented toward reforming public schools, in some cases to offer more religious education.",
              "In at least a few documented cases (for example, in Texas, Florida, and Pennsylvania), the individuals lodging complaints about books did not have children attending public schools when at the time they raised objections.",
              "This evolving censorship movement has grown in size and routinely finds new targets and tactics, homing in on the books encompassed in district book purchases or digital library apps.",
              "A parallel but connected movement is also targeting public libraries, with calls to ban books;",
              "efforts to intimidate, harass, or fire librarians;",
              "and even attempts to suspend or defund entire libraries.",
              "PEN America defines a school book ban as any action taken against a book based on its content and as a result of parent or community challenges, administrative decisions, or in response to direct or threatened action by lawmakers or other governmental officials, that leads to a previously accessible book being either completely removed from availability to students, or where access to a book is restricted or diminished.",
              "It is important to recognize that books available in schools, whether in a school or classroom library, or as part of a curriculum, were selected by librarians and educators as part of the educational offerings to students.",
              "Book bans occur when those choices are overridden by school boards, administrators, teachers, or even politicians, on the basis of a particular book\u2019s content.",
              "School book bans take varied forms, and can include prohibitions on books in libraries or classrooms, as well as a range of other restrictions, some of which may be temporary.",
              "Book removals that follow established processes may still improperly target books on the basis of content pertaining to race, gender, or sexual orientation, invoking concerns of equal protection in education.",

              "A further 275 more banned books followed from April through June, bringing the total for the 2021-22 school year to 2,532 bans.",
              "This book-banning effort is continuing as the 2022\u201323 school year begins too, with at least 139 additional bans taking effect since July 2022.",
              "In addition to the role played in book banning by local, state, and national groups, efforts to restrict access to books were also advanced in the past year by government officials and enabled by both state-level legislation and district-level policy changes.",
              "PEN America estimates that at least 40 percent of the bans counted in the Index of School Book Bans for the 2021\u201322 school year are connected to political pressure exerted by state officials or elected lawmakers.",
              "Some officials for example sent letters specifically inquiring into the availability of certain books in schools, such as occurred in Texas, Wisconsin, and South Carolina.",
              "Since March 2022, we have also seen for the first time educational gag orders passed that implicate restrictions on books, most notably in Florida, as well as a range of other new laws that have put pressure on schools to censor their libraries.",
              "The Alpine School District in Utah responded to a new law, HB 374 (\u201cSensitive Materials in Schools\u201d), by announcing the removal of 52 titles in July, but then opted to keep the books on shelves with some restrictions after national pushback.",

              "Altogether, this report paints a deeply concerning picture for access to literature, and diverse literature in particular, in schools in the coming school year.",
              "Book banning and educational gag orders are two fronts in an all-out war on education and the open discussion and debate of ideas in America.",
              "Students have First Amendment rights to access information and ideas in schools, and these bans and legislative shifts pose clear threats to those rights.",
              "This climate is also increasingly undermining the professional discretion of educators and librarians when it comes to matters of public education, and disrupting the potential for effective relationships between parents, teachers and administrators that can actually serve to advance student learning and civic engagement.",

              "PEN America does not count these duplicate book bans in its unique title tally, but does acknowledge each separate ban in its overall count.",
              "In some cases, books are removed from shelves pending investigations or reviews, and they may be only temporarily restricted, but their restriction is recorded in the Index as a ban since such restrictions are counter to procedural best practices for book challenges from the American Library Association (ALA) and the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC).",
              "Detailed definitions can be found in the first edition of Banned in the USA (April 2022).",
              "PEN America\u2019s recent findings on each type of ban for the 2021-22 school year are listed below.",
              "Beginning in 2021, a range of individuals and groups sought to remove from schools books focused on issues of race or the history of slavery and racism, mirroring a campaign pushed by some legislators to pass educational gag orders\u2014bills restricting discussion of these and other concepts in school classrooms and curricula.",
              "Although the campaign to enact educational gag orders initially focused on misapplications of the academic term \u201ccritical race theory\u201d to censor discussions of race and racism, over the past year, it morphed to include a heightened focus on LGBTQ+ issues and identities.",
              "Similar trends \u2014 and similar rhetoric and reasoning \u2014 have been evident in efforts to ban books in schools as they have expanded since 2021, too.",

              "In other cases, districts followed policies that failed to afford full protection for freedom of expression\u2014for example, by restricting student access to books while they are under review, by failing to convene a committee to review the complaint, or by not having the complainant complete the paperwork or read the whole book to which they were objecting as required by the stated policies.",
              "In some communities where existing procedures are more aligned with the standards set forth in the ALA and NCAC guidelines, or where advocates for book banning have been stifled in their efforts, there have been new efforts to alter those policies and make the removal of books easier.",

              "In April, May, and June 2022, PEN America tracked several cases where school administrators have banned books in the absence of any challenge in their own district, seemingly in a preemptive response to potential bills, threats from state officials, or challenges in other districts.",
              "The most significant ban of this type occurred in Collierville, Tennessee, where a school district removed 327 books from shelves in anticipation of a state law that ultimately did not pass.",

              "tier 3, for instance, reflected that \u201cthe main character of the book is part of the LGBTQ community, and their sexual identity forms a key component of the plot.",

              "\u201d If a book reached tier 5, according to the sorting guidelines, \u201cthe books are being pulled.",
              "\u201d Other preemptive bans were responses to actions at the state level or in neighboring districts.",
              "For example, according to Texas media reports, bans in Katy ISD, Clear Creek ISD, and Cypress-Fairbanks ISD were the result of administrators responding either to what was happening in other districts or to an 850-book list compiled and circulated to education officials by Texas state representative Matt Krause.",
              "Finally, PEN America has tracked other instances of books included in banned book displays, or other disputed materials, being quietly removed to avoid controversy.",
              "Books are also being labeled or marked in some way as \u201cinappropriate\u201d both in online catalogs and on physical titles themselves.",
              "In the Collier County School District in Florida, for instance, warning labels were attached to a group of more than 100 books that disproportionately included stories featuring LGBTQ+ characters and characters of color.",
              "While these cases are not included in the Index because they do not meet PEN America\u2019s definition of school book bans, these types of actions could have a chilling effect\u2014applying a stigma to the books in question and the topics they cover\u2014and they merit further study.",
              "While several stories of preemptive and silent book bans have made it into the news or to the attention of PEN America, it is clear that mounting censorship and the punitive approach being taken to the enforcement of book bans is having wide ripple effects.",
              "The Supreme Court has sharply restricted viewpoint- and subject-matter-based restrictions on speech precisely because in addition to rendering certain ideas, stories, and opinions off-limits, such measures cast a wider chilling effect on expression.",
              "Given the rapid spread of book bans across the country, it seems inevitable that the resulting climate of caution and fear will result in a reluctance among teachers, administrators, and librarians to take risks that could affect their own employment, their budgets, their reputations, and even their personal safety.",

              "In the same month, there were efforts to ban displays of LGBTQ+ materials entirely in some public libraries, such as in Smithtown, New York, and Lafayette Parish, Louisiana.",

              "The unprecedented flood of book bans in the 2021\u201322 school year reflects the increasing organization of groups involved in advocating for such bans, the increased involvement of state officials in book-banning debates, and the introduction of new laws and policies.",
              "More often than not, current challenges to books originate not from concerned parents acting individually but from political and advocacy groups working in concert to achieve the goal of limiting what books students can access and read in public schools.",
