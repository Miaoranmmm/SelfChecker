    "query": "What is the most compelling evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial life, and what ongoing research is being conducted to explore and better understand this possibility?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and complex question. The answer depends on how you define extraterrestrial life, what kind of evidence you are looking for, and where you are looking for it. There is no definitive answer, but I can share some of the findings and research that have been done on this topic.\n\nOne of the most controversial claims of evidence for extraterrestrial life is the detection of **phosphine** gas in the clouds of **Venus**[^2^]. Phosphine is a rare and often poisonous gas that, on Earth, is almost always associated with living organisms. Some scientists have suggested that phosphine could be produced by microbial life in the upper atmosphere of Venus, where the temperature and pressure are more hospitable than on the surface[^2^]. However, other scientists have challenged this interpretation and argued that phosphine could have non-biological origins, such as volcanic activity, lightning, or meteorites[^2^]. The debate is still ongoing and more observations are needed to confirm or refute the presence of phosphine and its possible sources on Venus[^2^].\n\nAnother possible source of evidence for extraterrestrial life is the detection of **radio signals** from nearby stars that could indicate intelligent civilizations. One such signal was reported in December 2020 from **Proxima Centauri**, the closest star to our own[^2^]. The signal was captured by a radio telescope in Australia and had a frequency of 980 megahertz, which is not used by human technology or natural sources[^2^]. The signal also shifted slightly while it was being observed, in a way that resembled the shift caused by the movement of a planet[^2^]. However, the signal has not been verified or repeated by other telescopes, and it could still be explained by human interference or other phenomena[^2^]. The researchers who detected the signal are cautious and do not claim it as evidence of alien life, but they are continuing to monitor Proxima Centauri for more clues[^2^].\n\nThere are many other ways to search for evidence of extraterrestrial life, such as looking for **biosignatures** (chemical or physical indicators of life) in the atmospheres of **exoplanets** (planets outside our solar system), searching for **microbial fossils** or **organic molecules** in **meteorites** or on other bodies in our solar system (such as Mars, Europa, Enceladus, or Titan), or sending **space probes** or **rovers** to explore potential habitable environments in our cosmic neighborhood. All these methods have their advantages and limitations, and none has yet provided conclusive proof of life beyond Earth[^1^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^] [^6^].\n\nHowever, many scientists are optimistic that we will find evidence of extraterrestrial life in the near future, given the vastness and diversity of the universe and the rapid advances in technology and exploration. Some estimate that there could be billions of Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone, and that some of them could host simple or complex forms of life[^3^] [^5^]. Others argue that we should not limit our imagination to what we know about life on Earth, and that there could be many different types of life forms that we have not yet conceived or encountered[^3^] [^5^].\n\nThe search for extraterrestrial life is one of the most fascinating and challenging endeavors in science. It encompasses many fundamental questions about our origins, our place in the universe, and our future. It also requires collaboration and cooperation among various disciplines and institutions around the world. It is a quest that may never end, but may also lead to some of the most profound discoveries ever made.",

              "Some of those launched probes into the atmosphere and even landed craft safely on the surface.",

              "And so my colleagues told me I had to figure out how life could survive.",
              "If it all just rains out, it couldn\u2019t stay in the atmosphere for billions of years, or hundreds of millions of years.",
              "How did you solve this?",
              "So I came up with this life cycle idea: as the droplets fall, they evaporate, and we\u2019re left with a dried, spore-like life form.",

              "It\u2019s very stable and long-lived.",
              "So the concept is that this haze layer is populated by dried-out spores, which can stay there for days, weeks, months years \u2014 and eventually they get updrafted back up to the region that has the right temperature for life, where it can attract liquid, hydrate it, and start their life cycle again.",
              "It\u2019s like a living rain, of sorts.",
              "Right.",

              "We have examples on Earth of dried-out spore living a long time.",
              "Why is it important to do this type of exercise, to be so speculative, and imagine life in a world so seemingly hostile to life?",
              "If we think about it and couldn\u2019t find any possible way for life to be in the atmosphere indefinitely, that would be bad news for the enthusiasts for life on Venus.",
              "Does that make sense?",
              "Yeah, if you can\u2019t think of any hypothetical that allows life to survive, it\u2019s hard to make a case to go look for it.",
              "Does the life you imagined fit in with in the new discovery of the phosphine gas?",
              "Yes.",
              "Well, it was motivated by the phosphine work.",
              "What would it mean to find life on Venus?",
              "I think it would mean that if there\u2019s life there, it has to be so different from Earth, and that we could show that it had a unique origin.",
              "It would just give us confidence that life can originate almost anywhere.",

              "That something seeded life on both Earth and Venus?",
              "We\u2019d have to figure it out.",
              "What are the next steps, ideally?",
              "Our ideal next step would be to send a spacecraft or spacecrafts, plural, to Venus, that could involve a probe going into the atmosphere and measuring gases confirming phosphine, looking for other gases, looking for complex molecules that might indicate life, and maybe even searching for life itself.",
              "Anyone working on that?",
              "Rocket Lab had mentioned about a month ago that they were planning to send a rocket to Venus.",

              "Venus seems to be neglected in terms of big NASA missions.",

              "But when it comes to what we\u2019re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple reasons that we can't rely only on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.",
              "First, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy.",
              "We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.",
              "Second, we\u2019re not in the subscriptions business.",
              "Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world \u2014 not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription.",

              "Some ideas included sunlight, minerals blown upwards from the surface, volcanoes, or lightning, but none of these could make anywhere near enough of it.",
              "These kinds of sources could only make, at most, one ten thousandth of the amount of phosphine that the telescopes saw.",

              "Since Venus is much too hot at its surface for any known earthly microbes, they must be in its atmosphere.",
              "There is a temperate region, between 48 and 60 kilometers (about 30 to 37 miles) above the surface, where temperatures range from 30 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (roughly 0 to 90 degrees Celsius).",

              "Scientists also think that Venus used to be much more habitable a few billion years ago, and even had oceans before the runaway greenhouse effect took hold.",
              "According to Sousa-Silva: A long time ago, Venus is thought to have had oceans, and was probably habitable like Earth.",
              "As Venus became less hospitable, life would have had to adapt, and they could now be in this narrow envelope of the atmosphere where they can still survive.",
              "This could show that even a planet at the edge of the habitable zone could have an atmosphere with a local aerial habitable envelope.",
              "This habitable zone in the cloud decks might be the last refuge for Venusian microorganisms. That\u2019s an incredible \u2013 if difficult to believe \u2013 thought, but if the scientists are right, then it is one of the most amazing discoveries in history.",
              "How amazing would it be to know that not only are we not alone, but that we had neighbors on the closest planet to Earth all this time?",

              "Earth alone has given rise to billions of species.",

              "On the other hand, the residents of these planets would probably find us disgusting too (a problem for interplanetary diplomacy to overcome).",
              "Nonetheless, if we find phosphine on a rocky planet in the habitable zone, where it has no false positives, we will have found life.",
              "There, she is talking about finding phosphine in the atmosphere of an exoplanet orbiting another star.",

              "They would cycle through different layers of the atmosphere, never reaching the ground, and survive the most extreme conditions by transitioning into a temporary dormant state.",
              "While the discovery is surprising, scientists have speculated for years that microbial life might exist in Venus\u2019 atmosphere.",
              "It might even explain, as postulated by some scientists, the unusual dark streaks that somehow absorb ultraviolet light, called \u201cunknown absorbers.",

              "The discovery puts a spotlight on the prospect of life in the venusian clouds, which was once considered a fringe idea.",
              "In addition to igniting much debate, the detection of unexplained phosphine in the clouds of Venus has already spurred more research and unofficial proposals about how future Venus missions could hunt for more signs of alien life.",
              "\u201cWhat\u2019s exciting about the phosphine discovery is that it demands follow-up,\u201d Bethany Ehlmann, a planetary scientist at Caltech who was not part of the discovery team, tells Astronomy.",
              "\u201cThe top three destinations to look for life in the solar system are Mars, Enceladus, and Europa \u2014 and now we should perhaps add Venus to the list.",
              "\u201d The thick clouds that obscure Venus\u2019 surface are visible in this artist\u2019s concept.",
              "Although the surface of Venus is hot enough to melt lead \u2014 nearly 900 degrees Fahrenheit, or 480 Celsius \u2014 Carl Sagan and Harold Morowitz proposed in 1967 that life could thrive in its clouds.",
              "After all, tens of miles above the surface, temperatures and pressures are much more Earth-like.",
              "But that was before scientists discovered just how extreme Venus is.",
              "The planet\u2019s clouds are made of at least 80 percent sulfuric acid \u2014 a corrosive, deadly compound that\u2019s thousands of times more acidic than battery acid.",
              "The idea that life could persist in those conditions, which many have doubted in the past, fell even further out of favor, astrobiologist David Grinspoon of the Planetary Science Institute tells Astronomy.",
              "In fact, he adds, \u201cit had kind of almost been forgotten about\u201d But in recent years, the notion of venusian life has made something of a comeback.",
              "In the early 1990s, NASA\u2019s Magellan probe mapped the surface of Venus with radar, revealing belching volcanoes that feed the world\u2019s sulfuric clouds.",
              "These clouds also interact with sunlight, linking the surface, the atmosphere, and the Sun through chemistry and creating a rich cycle of activity that has no other analog in the solar system except Earth.",
              "The energy and minerals stirred up in these clouds could provide a temperate niche that\u2019s rich in the nutrients necessary for life, says Grinspoon, who advanced this argument in his 1997 book Venus Revealed.",
              "\u201cThe clouds are like the ocean of Venus,\u201d he says.",
              "More recently, scientists have also learned that microbes are more adaptable than once thought.",
              "So-called extremophiles can survive and thrive in environments previously considered uninhabitable.",

              "\u201cYou get this picture where these two habitable \u2014 and maybe inhabited \u2014 worlds [Earth and Venus] are right next door to each other for billions of years, who knows, exchanging life or evolving in parallel,\u201d says Grinspoon.",
              "So, when a runaway greenhouse effect finally overcame Venus and sterilized its surface, perhaps life took refuge in the clouds.",
              "In a paper published last month, Seager and her colleagues proposed a hypothetical life cycle that would allow venusian microbes to survive at altitudes between 30 to 37 miles (48 to 60 kilometers) above the surface.",
              "The idea depends on the microbes hibernating as \u201cspores\u201d cocooned inside sulfuric acid cloud droplets, episodically falling to lower cloud layers as acid rain, before later surfing back skyward on updrafts of air.",
              "The proposed life cycle for microbes surviving in the acid clouds of Venus is seen in this illustration.",
              "(1) Dehydrated microbes survive in a vegetative state in Venus\u2019 lower haze layer.",

              "(5) The droplets grow large enough that they sink through the atmosphere, where they begin to evaporate due to higher temperatures, prompting microbes to transform into spores that float in the lower haze layer.",
              "Intrigued by the potential for cloud-dwelling life on Venus, in 2016, Greaves set out to search for evidence.",
              "She began her quest by researching what chemicals could be detected by radio telescopes.",

              "The amount of phosphine that has been detected is relatively large.",
              "On Earth, phosphine can result from natural processes such as lightning and volcanic activity, but only in small amounts.",
              "The only known processes that produce phosphine on Earth in similar quantities are biological in origin.",
              "No.",
              "What's exciting is that this is the first detection of a possible sign of life for which we have no plausible alternative explanation.",
              "That doesn't mean that there definitely is life, as we could be missing some other method of producing phosphine in the required amounts, but it's a very exciting possibility which needs more investigation.",
              "Observations of the light passing through the atmosphere of Venus were made using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in Hawaii.",
              "Atoms and molecules absorb light at very specific and unique wavelengths, and the resulting 'absorption spectrum\u2019 revealed a gap at the wavelength of phosphine.",
              "This implied that phosphine was present, and absorbing light as it passed through the atmosphere.",
              "Yes \u2013 confirmation was obtained by making further observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile.",
              "This confirmed the initial detection, and no other known molecule can explain the observed features.",
              "Processes such as lightning or volcanic activity can produce small amounts of phosphine on Earth.",
              "The molecule can also be delivered by meteorites, or generated by exotic processes such as interaction with the solar wind.",
              "However these only produce very small amounts, far less than would be necessary to explain the observations.",
              "A series of probes were sent to Venus during the 60s, 70s and 80s.",
              "Some of those launched probes into the atmosphere and even landed craft safely on the surface.",
              "The possibility of contamination is there, but it is highly unlikely they could produce the amount of phosphine we see in these observations.",
              "Very few organisms on Earth produce phosphine, and very few if any are capable of surviving in the extreme conditions in the Venusian cloud decks.",
              "This makes it highly unlikely that this is biological contamination from Earth.",
              "The best way of doing this would be to directly detect life itself.",
              "Ultimately this would involve re-visiting Venus with probes, which would make measurements in the planet\u2019s atmosphere, and potentially bring back samples to Earth for further analysis.",
              "Mercury has no atmosphere, and is simultaneously very hot (on the side facing the Sun) and very cold (on the side facing away).",
              "Life here is highly unlikely.",
              "Life on Mars is a possibility, at least historically, because it is now fairly clear that Mars went through a warm wet period.",
              "The search for signs of life on Mars is already under way.",
              "Jupiter is very different since it is a gas giant planet whose atmosphere is dominated by hydrogen, rather than carbon dioxide.",
              "This makes life in the atmosphere of Jupiter highly unlikely.",
              "However the moons of Jupiter, such as Europa and Ganymede, have liquid water oceans beneath ice caps kilometres thick, and so life there is more of a possibility.",

              "Phosphine, a toxic gas made up of one phosphorus and three hydrogen atoms (PH3), commonly produced by organic life forms but otherwise difficult to make on rocky planets, was discovered in the middle layer of the Venus atmosphere.",
              "This raises the tantalizing possibility that something is alive on our planetary neighbor.",
              "With this discovery, Venus joins the exalted ranks of Mars and the icy moons Enceladus and Europa among planetary bodies where life may once have existed, or perhaps might even still do so today.",

              "Atmospheric mysteries First, it\u2019s critical to point out that this detection does not mean that astronomers have found alien life in the clouds of Venus.",
              "Far from it, in fact.",
              "Although the discovery team identified phosphine at Venus with two different telescopes, helping to confirm the initial detection, phosphine gas can result from several processes that are unrelated to life, such as lightning, meteor impacts or even volcanic activity.",
              "However, the quantity of phosphine detected in the Venusian clouds seems to be far greater than those processes are capable of generating, allowing the team to rule out numerous inorganic possibilities.",
              "But our understanding of the chemistry of Venus\u2019 atmosphere is sorely lacking: Only a handful of missions have plunged through the inhospitable, carbon dioxide-dominated atmosphere to take samples among the global layer of sulfuric acid clouds.",
              "So we planetary scientists are faced with two possibilities: Either there is some sort of life in the Venus clouds, generating phosphine, or there is unexplained and unexpected chemistry taking place there.",
              "How do we find out which it is?",
              "First and foremost, we need more information about the abundance of PH3 in the Venus atmosphere, and we can learn something about this from Earth.",
              "Just as the discovery team did, existing telescopes capable of detecting phosphine around Venus can be used for follow-up observations, to both definitively confirm the initial finding and figure out if the amount of PH3 in the atmosphere changes with time.",
              "In parallel, there is now a huge opportunity to carry out lab work to better understand the types of chemical reactions that might be possible on Venus \u2014 for which we have very limited information at present.",
              "Once more into the breach But measurements on and from Earth can take us only so far.",
              "To really get to the heart of this mystery, we need to go back to Venus.",
              "Spacecraft equipped with spectrometers that can detect phosphine from orbit could be dispatched to the second planet with the express purpose of characterizing where, and how much, of this gas is there.",
              "Because spacecraft can survive for many years in Venus\u2019 orbit, we could obtain continuous observations with a dedicated orbiter over a much longer period than with telescopes on Earth.",
              "But even orbital data can\u2019t tell us the whole story.",
              "To fully get a handle on what\u2019s happening at Venus, we have to actually get into the atmosphere.",
              "And that\u2019s where aerial platforms come in.",
              "Capable of operating above much of the acidic cloud layer \u2013 where the temperature and pressure are almost Earthlike \u2013 for potentially months at a time, balloons or flying wings could take detailed atmospheric composition measurements there.",
              "These craft could even carry the kinds of instruments being developed to look for life on Europa.",
              "At that point, humanity might finally be able to definitively tell if we share our Solar System with Venusian life.",
              "A new dawn for Venus exploration?",
              "Thirty-one years have elapsed since the United States last sent a dedicated mission to Venus.",
              "That could soon change as NASA considers two of four missions in the late 2020s targeting Venus.",
              "One, called VERITAS, would carry a powerful radar to peer through the thick clouds and return unprecedented high-resolution images of the surface.",
              "The other, DAVINCI+, would plunge through the atmosphere, sampling the air as it descended, perhaps even able to sniff any phosphine present.",
              "NASA plans to pick at least one mission in April 2021.",
              "I have argued before for a return to Venus, and will continue to do so.",
              "Even without this latest scientific discovery, Venus is a compelling exploration target, with tantalizing evidence that the planet once had oceans and perhaps even suffered a hellish fate at the hands of its own volcanic eruptions.",

              "Another point to note is that the signal apparently came from the direction of Proxima Centauri, but it\u2019s not a slam-dunk that the star really is the source.",

              "Located in Austrailia, the CSIRO Parkes Radio Telescope picked up the strange signal stemming from Proxima Centauri.",
              "On 29 April 2019, the Parkes Radio Telescope in New South Wales, Australia, picked up an unusual signal while searching for signs of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.",
              "The telescope was observing Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the sun and host to a number of exoplanets that are potentially habitable.",
              "The search was part of a project called Breakthrough Listen, which is hunting for technosignatures from other civilizations.",
              "These searches gather vast amounts of data.",
              "So the first task is to filter the interesting signals from the background.",
              "In theory, a technosignature must have two important properties.",
              "The first is that it must be confined to a narrowband of frequencies with high information content, just like radio broadcasts on Earth.",
              "No known natural process can produce signals like this.",
              "The second is that the frequency of the signal must drift in a way that is consistent with the motion of an exoplanet relative to the Earth.",
              "The drift is the result of the relative accelerations which causes a slight Doppler shift.",
              "So Sofia Sheikh at the University of California, Berkeley and colleagues created a filter that automatically separates signals with these properties from all the others the telescope picks up.",
              "They found over 4 million of them.",
              "To help pick out false alarms, the telescope regularly switches from its target to point in other directions.",
              "That allowed Sheikh and co to discount any signals that continued in both periods.",
              "That left just 5160 hits.",
              "The team further filtered out any signals in the range of known radio transmitters and any with a drift that corresponds to the motion of satellites.",
              "That left a single unexplained event.",
              "The team describe it as a narrowband signal with characteristics broadly consistent with a technosignature, which appeared during a 2.",
              "5 hour period of observation but only when the telescope was pointing towards Proxima Centauri.",
              "\u201cThe event does not lie within the frequency range of any known local radio-frequency interference, and has many characteristics consistent with a putative transmitter located in another stellar system,\u201d say Sheikh and co.",
              "\u201d They called this signal of interest Breakthrough Listen Candidate 1 or BLC1 and it has been the subject of an extraordinary investigation.",
              "Attributing a signal to an alien civilization is the hypothesis of last resort.",
              "Before that, every conventional explanation has to be explored and refuted.",
              "So Sheikh and co undertook a remarkable investigation into the possibility of complex but conventional explanations.",
              "They began by re-observing Proxima Centauri earlier this year, exactly two years after the first observation, to replicate as far as possible the initial observing conditions.",
              "During these observations, they found no evidence of a signal similar to BLC1.",
              "They then re-examined the possibility that a moving transmitter nearby could be the source\u2014a car, train, helicopter, plane, balloon etc.",
              "Perhaps such a moving transmitter could reproduce the observed drift on BLC1.",
              "The problem with this explanation is that BLC1 appeared for several hours.",
              "The team could find no reasonable trajectory that reproduced the drift for such a long period of time.",
              "\u201cIt is extremely difficult to construct a continual motion path that could persist as exhibited by the measured signal, even by varying the speed along the route,\u201d they concluded.",
              "They came to a similar conclusion that satellites could not be the source.",
              "Low Earth Orbit satellites move too quickly to be observed over such a long period.",
              "And geostationary satellites do not drift.",
              "Neither could have produced BLC1.",
              "Then there are deep space probes in distant parts of the Solar System.",
              "But the team were able to rule them out because none are in line with the telescope and Proxima Centauri and so could not be the source.",
              "Next, the team looked for drifting signals, similar to BLC1, in data that had been originally rejected by their filtering algorithm.",
              "This required the researchers to visually inspect the data, looking for patterns similar to BLC1.",
              "Amazingly, they found four examples of BLC1-like signals with a signal-to-noise ration so low that they had failed to reach the detection threshold of their algorithm.",
              "They then looked for similar signals in the data gathered from other stars, some 7000 observations in total.",
              "Again, amazingly, they found 1 example of a signal similar to BLC1.",
              "\u201cAll five of these 982 MHz signals from different days are fainter than BLC1;",
              "three of them conclusively appear in the off-sources, while two of them are inconclusive,\u201d say Sheikh and co.",
              "These five signals point to an alternative explanation\u2014that BLC1 Is a complex form of radio interference that just happened to appear at the time the team were observing Proxima Centauri.",
              "If this were true, thought the researchers, there ought to be other examples of similar patterns at other frequencies.",
              "So again they went back to the original data and found 36 signals at other frequencies that looked like BLC1 but that had been filtered out by the search algorithm as obvious radio interference.",
              "These signals had \u201cstrikingly similar morphology to blc1\u201d.",
              "Finally, the team looked for mirror images of the BLC1 signal\u2014in other words signals with negative drift rates.",
              "Sure enough, they found 27 mirrored lookalikes.",
              "All these appeared in data from observations when the telescope was pointing away from Proxima Centauri.",
              "To determine the possible origin of these signals, the team looked at their common properties, whether they could be part of a harmonic sequence from a parent signal or had a more complex relationship.",
              "That\u2019s when the origin became clear.",
              "They all appeared to be multiples of frequencies used in common clock oscillators.",
              "That meant the signals were almost certainly generated by the interaction of ordinary digital electronic devices, probably from the radio frequency environment of the telescope facility itself.",
              "In other words, the telescope was probably picking up its own radio frequency interference, albeit a complex and rare example of it.",
              "The team have yet to identify the precise origin but say that should be possible with future studies.",
              "That\u2019s interesting work that reveals just how challenging the search of extraterrestrial technosignatures will be.",
              "BLC1 will contribute in its own way to future research.",
              "As a result of this work, Sheikh and co have produced a checklist of steps that astronomers will have to work through whenever they find a signal of interest, to rule out the possibility of this kind of complex interference.",
              "It also raises important questions about data storage.",
              "A feature part of this work was the ability to reanalyze data that had originally been discarded as noise.",
              "That\u2019s a significant amount of data that is hard to store.",
              "Just how much of this should be stored in future, in what format and for how long is up for debate.",
              "But Sheikh and co have shown how important it can be: \u201cHere we have learned that neglecting to consider the entire operable bandwidth of a receiver can have serious consequences.",

              "Such answers could come by the end of the 2030s from any of a number of initiatives ardently seeking alien life.",
              "By then, samples from Mars will have arrived back on Earth, perhaps containing concrete proof that the Red Planet once harbored organisms or still does today.",
              "Spacecraft at Jupiter\u2019s Europa and Saturn\u2019s Titan will be scouring both moons for signs of life residing in each world\u2019s subsurface ocean or, in the case of Titan, on the surface itself.",
              "And advanced telescopes on the ground and in space should be probing the atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets around nearby stars, looking for any that share the same biology-infused cocktail of gases as our own living Earth.",
              "As confident as astrobiologists may be that their quest will soon bear fruit, however, they are far less certain of how to communicate that success if and when it occurs.",
              "How should they go about informing the world that we are truly not alone in this universe\u2014especially given their field\u2019s long, troubled history of dubious claims and false alarms?",
              "They have been fooled before, after all.",
              "In an October 2021 article published in Nature, a group of scientists came to grips with the problem.",
              "Led by NASA\u2019s chief scientist James Green, the researchers proposed a new framework to help verify and then communicate the detection of biosignatures beyond Earth, like the Torino scale for assessing the danger of asteroids.",
              "Their idea is to use a scale, from level 1 to level 7, that will allow confidence in any given case to be gradually increased.",
              "Known as the \u201cconfidence of life detection,\u201d or CoLD, scale, it calls initially for simple confirmation that a result is not linked to contamination or some obviously abiotic origin, whereas its final levels would represent robust follow-up observations solidifying a link to life.",
              "\u201cThese things are complex,\u201d Green says.",
              "\u201cBut we really need to be able to communicate it simply.",
              "\u201d There is no shortage of cautionary tales from previous efforts to publicize apparent breakthroughs.",
              "In 1996 President Bill Clinton heralded the discovery of a meteorite from Mars, ALH84001, that appeared to contain signs of life.",

              "The finding was not confirmed: later analysis poured cold water on the tentative evidence of Martian life.",
              "Luckily, astrobiology\u2019s positive public perception emerged relatively unscathed.",
              "Yet a repeat of that incident could now have disastrous consequences.",

              "\u201c[It\u2019s] all the more reason to communicate effectively.",
              "\u201d More recently, the supposed detection on Venus of atmospheric phosphine, a possible biosignature gas, had many suggesting a biological origin, but that detection has itself since been called into question.",
              "More outlandish ideas, such as the suggestion that the interstellar object \u2018Oumuamua found in our solar system in 2017 may have been an alien spacecraft rather than an asteroid or comet, have been met with widespread disdain from scientists and have the potential to dampen confidence in genuine detections of life.",
              "The CoLD scale could prevent scientists from \u201ccrying wolf\u201d in this manner, Green says, because any overly cavalier claims would not pass the more stringent tests required to progress up the scale.",
              "\u201cLife-detection measurements can be sensationalized,\u201d he says.",
              "Deciding how to approach actual detections of biosignatures is a topic other scientists have been considering, too.",

              "Hundreds of scientists took part, with many in favor of more rigorous communications protocols.",
              "\u201cThe potential for us to actually have some sort of interesting life-detection event on another world is becoming greater,\u201d says the workshop\u2019s co-chair Heather Graham of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.",

              "\u201d If scientists were to adopt the CoLD scale, the first of its seven steps, or levels, would be the actual detection of a potential biosignature.",
              "Next, scientists would need to rule out contamination before demonstrating how the signal could be biological in origin.",
              "Nonbiological sources would then need to be ruled out, followed by an independent additional detection of a similar biosignature.",
              "Further observations would need to rule out nonbiological ideas before, finally, follow-up observations showed other examples of biological activity in the same environment, making a detection a level 7\u2014essentially, proof of alien life.",
              "Part of the hope is that the scientific community at large would agree to use such a scale.",
              "Agencies such as NASA might also agree to do so, which would also help dictate future missions.",
              "\u201cIf we\u2019re stuck at level 4, and we think we can go to level 6 with a mission, I want to fund that,\u201d Green says.",

              "\u201d The call for such a step-based approach is driven by the unescapable likelihood that any initial detection of alien life is likely to be ambiguous rather than a smoking gun: any glaringly obvious indication of alien life would have been clear by now, decades into the hunt.",
