    "response": "That's a great question. Plastic pollution in our oceans is a serious and growing problem that affects marine life, human health, and the environment. There is no single solution to this complex issue, but there are some steps that can be taken to reduce plastic waste and its impact on the ocean. According to various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^6^], some of these steps are:\n\n- Reducing our use of single-use plastics, such as bags, bottles, straws, cups, utensils, and wrappers, and replacing them with reusable alternatives.\n- Supporting legislation that curbs plastic production and waste, improves waste management, and makes plastic producers responsible for the waste they generate.\n- Boycotting products that contain microbeads, which are tiny plastic particles that can be ingested by marine animals and accumulate in the food chain.\n- Cooking more at home and avoiding takeout containers and plastic cutlery when eating out or ordering in.\n- Purchasing items secondhand or choosing products with minimal or recyclable packaging.\n- Recycling properly and disposing of trash responsibly. Never litter or dump anything into the ocean or waterways.\n- Participating in beach cleanups or supporting organizations that work to remove plastic from the ocean, such as Ocean Cleanup[^5^], which aims to eliminate 90% of floating plastic pollution in the ocean with its collection systems.\n\nThese are some of the ways we can help solve the ocean's plastic problem. However, to implement them on a global scale, we need more awareness, education, innovation, collaboration, and action from individuals, communities, businesses, governments, and international organizations.

              "Back in the lab, they would confirm what Thompson had first suspected: the particles were all pieces of plastic, no larger than grains of sand, and ubiquitous along the UK coastline.",
              "It was pollution on a whole new scale.",
              "\u201cI started studying marine biology because it was going to be all about turtles, dolphins, and coral reefs,\u201d he says.",
              "Instead, those minuscule particles became his main fascination.",
              "In a short study in 2004, co-authored with Prof Andrea Russell at Southampton University, Thompson first described the particles as \u201cmicroplastics\u201d.",
              "He hypothesised that as plastic entered the sea, it slowly fragmented into small but persistent pieces that spread even farther afield.",
              "He did not expect much reaction from his modest one-page article.",
              "\u201cIt had been a May bank holiday weekend, and we\u2019d been away camping.",
              "I came back in and every email that morning was from a journalist, and the phone was ringing continuously.",
              "\u201d The story was picked up instantly by networks in the UK, Europe and Asia.",
              "\u201cShortly after it was published, it was being discussed in the Canadian parliament,\u201d says Russell, whose experiments had confirmed that the particles were plastic.",
              "The discovery helped spawn an entire field of microplastics research, and would be instrumental in plastic bag taxes and bans on plastic microbeads in rinse-off cosmetics in countries including the US, New Zealand and Canada.",
              "Researchers now look at even tinier fragments called nanoplastics that infiltrate our blood, wombs and breastmilk.",
              "As for Thompson, he would go on to be named the \u201cgodfather of microplastics\u201d by a British politician, establish the International Marine Litter Research Unit at Plymouth and become a frequent guest at the House of Commons to discuss the dangers of marine litter.",
              "Most recently, he has been catapulted into the heart of international negotiations to draw up a global treaty to curb plastic pollution, which had its most recent talks in Paris in June.",
              "A UN-led plastics treaty is a \u201conce-in-a-planet opportunity\u201d, Thompson says, but on some of the supposed solutions being put forth, he is very clear.",
              "He is adamant that biodegradable plastic cannot save us.",
              "Neither can any amount of \u201ccleanups\u201d, like his own fateful expedition in 1993.",
              "What\u2019s worse, he thinks, is that if the plastics treaty sends the world chasing the wrong ideas, microplastics pollution will only worsen.",
              "\u201cThere\u2019s a real risk that worries me,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cThat if we guess at this, we\u2019ll get it wrong.",
              "\u201d A tall figure who speaks with an infectious enthusiasm despite the subject of his work, Thompson often starts conversations by checking his watch \u2013 knowing that once he gets started on plastics, time can quickly run away.",
              "He describes his discovery as the result of a solution gone awry.",
              "Plastic was invented as a sustainable alternative to ivory, then became indispensable in fields such as engineering and medicine.",
              "But the problem began in the 1950s when the industry\u2019s ambitions turned to single-use packaging, which now accounts for 40% of the more than 400m tonnes of plastic produced each year \u2013 at least 8m tonnes of which finds its way to the ocean.",
              "Meanwhile, production is only increasing.",
              "The other side to this coin is plastic\u2019s persistence in nature.",
              "Thompson\u2019s hypothesis was correct: microplastics result from the lengthy breakdown of larger items, and they will linger for decades more thanks to plastic\u2019s inherent durability, all the while absorbing harmful toxins and pathogens that end up in the bodies of marine animals.",
              "It was known that plastic waste floated in the ocean, but it was not until Thompson gave the tiny versions a name that the world finally recognised the scale of this new pollution.",
              "\u201cI saw [Thompson\u2019s 2004] paper and said: \u2018This is really important.",
              "Maybe people are going to wake up to the widespread abundance of plastics in the ocean,\u2019\u201d says Edward Carpenter, a retired marine scientist who was the first to describe floating plastic fragments on the surface of the Sargasso Sea in 1972 \u2013 particles that are probably still at sea to this day.",
              "Thompson went on to provide the first evidence that sea creatures ingest these particles.",
              "He also showed their global distribution, including in the Arctic and in every sample of sand taken from dozens of beaches worldwide.",
              "The plastics treaty would be a shot at stemming this flow, he notes.",
              "Much depends on the treaty\u2019s scope, on questions such as whether it should ban some types of plastic, or regulate the array of 13,000 chemicals in everyday packaging.",
              "What concerns Thompson is that policymakers may be led astray by much-hyped approaches that are already being used \u2013 for instance, hi-tech initiatives to remove plastic from the sea, such as the Ocean Cleanup.",
              "Thompson stresses that he is an ardent believer in cleanups for coastal pollution, but that it is \u201cnaive to expect that [cleanups] can be a systemic solution\u201d to the vast threat of microplastics.",
              "\u201cThe psychologists would call it \u2018techno-optimism\u2019,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cIf we\u2019re not careful, the public gets convinced that a big gadget whizzing around in the middle of the Pacific gyre is going to mop it all up for us, and that\u2019s the end of the story.",
              "Sign up to Global Dispatch Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion \u201cIt\u2019s an attractive story \u2013 from the point of view of not having to change anything we do.",

              "\u201d Thompson says.",
              "But, although they are a partial improvement on the fossil-fuel footprint of conventional plastics, and may have some legitimate uses, most biodegradable plastics do not melt away into nature \u2013 a fact Thompson first realised when, early in his research career, he visited a government trade fair and brought home a bag marked biodegradable.",
              "\u201cI\u2019ve still got it here somewhere!",
              "\u201d he says, gesturing at shelves stacked with folders.",
              "We now know \u2013 again, thanks to experiments by Thompson and colleagues \u2013 that many biodegradables need controlled industrial conditions to degrade, and take years to disappear in soil and sea.",
              "\u201cIf we keep the nearly 300-400m tonnes of plastic we\u2019re making every year, and all we\u2019re doing is chucking biosource plastics [which are biodegradable] to fill the gap, it doesn\u2019t fix the problem of litter, it doesn\u2019t fix the problem of waste, it doesn\u2019t fix the problem of chemicals,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s just substituting the carbon source.",
              "\u201d None of these kinds of actions change what he thinks is the real danger: the linear relationship we have with plastic \u2013 produce, consume, dispose \u2013 which created the problem.",
              "After two decades describing that problem, he is now focused on the cause.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s very much coming back to the land, my research, because the problem isn\u2019t made in the ocean: it\u2019s made by practices on land.",
              "\u201d He said as much at the Paris talks.",
              "\u201cLet\u2019s turn to the solutions, which lie upstream,\u201d he told an audience of delegates from 58 countries, explaining that in order to slow the flowing river of plastic, we first need to narrow its source.",
              "\u201cWe can\u2019t carry on [producing] at the rate we are.",
              "It\u2019s overwhelming any ability to cope with it.",
              "\u201d He agrees with new calls among treaty negotiators to curb \u201cunnecessary, avoidable or problematic\u201d plastics, which could include the deluge of single-use items. \u201cI mean, surely we want to buy the product, not the packaging it\u2019s in,\u201d Thompson says.",
              "\u201cI think that\u2019s a key place to start: the most important [type of plastic] accumulating in the oceans and escaping waste-management systems is packaging.",
              "\u201d But while items sheathed in Russian-doll-like layers of plastic are obvious candidates for cuts, certain plastics do bring legitimate value to our lives and are likely to remain with us, Thompson says.",
              "\u201cI\u2019m not saying we can carry on with business as usual.",
              "Reduce has to be the first action,\u201d he stresses \u2013 but for the plastic that remains in use, he believes the challenge is to redesign it.",
              "Just 10% of plastic is recycled globally, a staggeringly low figure that is partly due to the thousands of chemicals that give plastic its diverse qualities, colours and forms and make it almost impossible to remix.",
              "\u201cWe do a really bad job of designing stuff for circularity.",
              "So when people say that it\u2019s clearly failed because we\u2019re only recycling 10%, I think the root cause of the error is at the design stage,\u201d Thompson says.",
              "\u201cWhen I talk to product designers, they say they were asked to design a product that was attractive \u2013 they weren\u2019t asked to consider end-of-life.",

              "He cites PET bottles as a good example of how simpler construction makes it possible to recycle some products up to 10 times.",
              "Redesign can also soften the impact of plastic during its lifecycle.",

              "Several countries now require filters on washing machines to capture these threads.",
              "Yet Thompson and his team have found that half the shedding happens, not during washing, but while people are wearing clothes.",
              "Redesigning fabric for longer wear reduces shedding by a striking 80%.",
              "\u201cSo the systemic answer would work for the planet,\u201d he says.",

              "Growing scientific consensus on these and other issues could soon be crucial in guiding nations towards solutions, so as a scientist, Thompson is frustrated that there is no UN-level mechanism to communicate the most up-to-date plastics research to governments.",
              "In its absence, he helped establish the Scientists Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty, an independent, voluntary group of 200 multidisciplinary researchers from 40 countries who are filling the gap by providing scientific advice to treaty negotiators.",

              "The report, produced by ocean advocacy group Oceana, shows that just a 10-percentage point increase in reusable beverage packaging by 2030 could eliminate over 1 trillion single-use plastic bottles and cups and prevent up to 153 billion of these containers from entering our world\u2019s oceans and waterways.",
              "Stacked on top of each other, the avoided 1 trillion bottles and cups could reach to the moon and back over 300 times.",
              "Global beverage leaders, including The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo, have enormous existing reusable systems in place around the world and have pledged to increase the volume of beverages they sell in reusable packaging by 10 percentage points or more by 2030.",
              "Oceana notes that these companies must meet these pledges and that the entire sector needs to fully commit to reuse over single-use to address the plastic pollution crisis facing our seas.",
              "Reusable packaging is a proven circular solution that can dramatically and quickly reduce the amount of plastic bottles and cups that are produced and that will reach the oceans.",
              "Other ideas more heavily promoted by beverage companies \u2013 such as adding more recycled content to plastic bottles are not, by design, geared toward reducing single-use plastic containers, and therefore cannot match the impact of reuse.",

              "By switching to this real circular solution, we can drastically reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in our oceans, in the bellies of whales and turtles, and washed up on our beaches.",
              "\u201d The report reveals the significant presence of large-scale reusable packaging systems around the world \u2013 including in the Philippines where 40% of the volume of all packaged non-alcoholic beverages sold are in reusable bottles.",

              "The UN Environment Programme estimated the global damage to marine environments from plastic pollution to be a minimum of $13 billion per year.",
              "And there are a whole host of non-plastic pollutants such as nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous that fuel harmful algal blooms, antibiotics, heavy metals, pesticides, oil and gas, and other debris.",
              "These pollutants enter the ocean directly, through rivers, stormwater or the wind.",
              "These substances have been damaging the environment, human health and the economy long before plastics became so prevalent.",
              "Protecting human and marine health and harnessing the full benefits of a sustainable ocean economy will require not only reducing plastic waste, but all ocean pollutants.",
              "The sundry pollutants making their way into the ocean often share common pathways and root causes, such as a lack of access to sanitation and wastewater processing or inefficient use of natural resources.",
              "Tackling these root causes can have a compounding effect.",
              "For example, improving wastewater management at scale in a city or region can reduce plastic entering the ocean while also reducing nutrient pollution, which in turn improves the health of fisheries and coral reefs.",
              "This means that there is an opportunity to capitalize on the attention being paid to plastic pollution in order to tackle multiple ocean pollutants at once.",

              "It can pose a severe risk to human and environmental health through toxic exposure, vector-borne diseases and eutrophication.",
              "Improve stormwater management by implementing stormwater and storm drain filtration and river mouth trash collection.",
              "This can prevent wastes such as macroplastics (littered items), microplastics (tire dust), and chemicals on roadways from flowing into rivers, and eventually, the ocean.",
              "Regulating the use of nutrients and pesticides and shifting behaviors \u2014 for example, the cultural norm around having a manicured lawn, which can increase the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers \u2014 can also ensure that these pollutants do not enter the ocean through stormwater.",
              "For example, a toxic algal bloom caused by nutrient pollution in the western Lake Erie basin in 2011 disrupted water supplies for 400,000 people.",
              "Adopt green chemistry practices and new materials.",
              "This includes banning hard-to-manage substances like expanded polystyrene (commonly packaging material), limiting the use of chemicals of concern like phthalates, and supporting materials research.",
              "Developing new materials that maintain the desirable performance characteristics of plastics but not the problematic ones, such as true biodegradables, could prevent plastics from causing as much harm if they do enter the ocean.",
              "Practice radical resource efficiency through plastic-use reduction.",
              "This includes imposing fees on single-use plastics, encouraging voluntary industry standards to reduce fossil-fuel-based plastics ,and shifting cultural norms around waste generation, consumption and reuse.",
              "For example, introducing carrier bag charges in the UK reduced the number of plastic bags used there by 80%, with 9 billion fewer plastic bags used since the legislation was introduced in 2015.",
              "Recover and recycle the materials we use in both formal and informal sectors by implementing extended producer responsibility laws, providing incentives for waste segregation and recycling, strengthening markets for recycled plastics and implementing \u201cFishing for Litter\u201d programs. Only 9% of all plastic ever discarded since 1950 has been recycled, while another 12% has been incinerated and the remaining 79% accumulated in landfills or the natural environment.",
              "Implement coastal zone improvements by, for example, restricting open ocean aquaculture.",
              "Shifting to sustainable land-based aquaculture systems could reduce a number of pollutants associated with coastal aquaculture, such as plastic pollution from lost or discarded gear and untreated waste with high levels of nitrogen and phosphorous.",
              "Encouraging participation in Adopt-a-Beach programs and clean beach certifications such as Blue Flag and Project Aware can reduce litter on beaches and make people more aware of pollution.",
              "Build local systems for safe food and water by establishing drinking water treatment systems where needed, and ensuring adequate drinking water standards.",
              "This solution can not only reduce pollutants entering the ocean from the reduction in single-use plastic bottles, but also help the 1 in 3 people worldwide who lack access to clean drinking water.",
              "These tactics can\u2019t be done on a small scale or by a single entity.",
              "In order to be successful, it is essential that solutions include cross-sectoral public-private partnerships, innovative financing arrangements and capital from a range of sources.",
              "For example, in Muncar, a small village in East Java, Indonesia, public private partnership organizers built a waste management system and strategy to optimize waste collection and processing for both inorganic and organic wastes, change behaviors, set regulations, and build institutional capacity.",
              "In December 2019, 47,500 people received waste collection services, mostly for the first time, from two facilities established by the project.",
              "These facilities employ 80 local people and have collected 3,000 tons of waste that would have otherwise potentially ended up in the ocean.",
              "By taking bold, integrated actions that address pollution across sectors, we can help build a sustainable ocean economy that can expand economic opportunities and improve the health and prosperity of millions of people.",
              "But our road to recovery must include the development of a circular economy.",

              "Plastic has been found in hundreds of marine species, from whales to sea birds, and in some of the most remote places on Earth, from the Galapagos Islands to the Mariana trench and to the Arctic and Antarctic.",
              "And the problem is only getting worse.",
              "Projected growth in plastic production and a growing global population are set to significantly increase the already-large flow of plastic into our oceans in the coming years.",
              "The Pew Charitable Trusts is working on solutions to this mounting problem and will release a new analysis in the coming months with the goal of helping inform government and industry actions to address this immense challenge.",
              "In partnership with SYSTEMIQ, the University of Oxford, the University of Leeds, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and Common Seas, Pew will present evidence-based pathways to reduce the flow of plastics in the ocean.",
              "Achieving that will not be easy and will require major shifts by many, from producers to waste managers, along with significant new investments and policy changes from government.",
              "But, as our analysis will show, by working together societies can significantly reduce the amount of plastic flowing into the ocean.",
              "Plastic products come in a variety of forms that make some easier to eliminate, substitute, or recycle than others.",
              "Solving the plastic pollution problem requires knowing what kinds of plastic are being produced and why.",
              "Below we look at several different categories of plastic, and how likely they are to be recycled.",
              "Rigid monomaterial items are made from a single plastic polymer that holds its shape.",
              "The most popular products include: The good news is that the volume of rigid monomaterial items, many of which end up in the ocean, can be significantly reduced through elimination, reuse, new delivery models, or substitution with alternative materials, such as paper.",
              "Rigid monomaterial plastics also tend to be easier to recycle and, therefore, are the most commonly recycled plastic type today.",
              "These products are also made from a single polymer, but they don\u2019t hold their shape.",
              "Some examples of flexible monomaterial plastic products are: Flexible monomaterial plastic is often hard to recycle, partly because its low weight makes cost-effective collection and recycling difficult and partly because the plastic is often contaminated.",
              "However, reduction\u2014through bans, incentives, packaging redesign, and reuse models\u2014and substitution with alternative materials, such as paper, can help reduce flexible monomaterial plastic waste.",
              "These items, primarily used for packaging, are typically made of a mix of plastic and nonplastic materials such as laminated paper and aluminum or different types of polymers.",
              "Examples include: Some of these products could be eliminated and replaced by new delivery models or alternative packaging materials, while others could be redesigned using monomaterial plastics so that they can be more readily recycled.",
              "The plastic economy is complex, diverse, and wasteful, contributing mightily to ocean pollution.",
              "Simplifying and changing this economy\u2014from production and supply chains to point-of-sale options and recycling\u2014could significantly boost efficiency in use of resources and generate far less waste.",
              "Accomplishing that begins with eliminating as many single-use plastic products as possible, including by replacing them with renewable and biodegradable materials where feasible, and by prolonging the useful life of some items through reuse and new delivery models.",
              "Next steps should include a concerted effort to redesign products to maximize usable life and recyclability, shift to sustainable alternative materials, and eliminate the use of hard-to-recycle and toxic plastics.",
