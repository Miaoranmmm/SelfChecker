    "query": "What is the most compelling theory about the central and often puzzling figure in Leonardo da Vinci's painting, the Mona Lisa, and what evidence supports this theory?",
    "response": "There are many theories about the central and often puzzling figure in Leonardo da Vinci's painting, the Mona Lisa, but one of the most compelling ones is that she is **Lisa del Giocondo** (n\u00e9e Gherardini), the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant who commissioned Leonardo to paint her portrait[^2^] [^3^]. One piece of evidence supporting this theory is a note that Leonardo wrote in 1503, in which he mentions painting a portrait of Lisa Gherardini[^6^]. Additionally, some art historians have noted that the facial features of the Mona Lisa bear a strong resemblance to Lisa\u2019s features, including her distinctive nose and eyebrows[^6^]. Another piece of evidence is that Leonardo never delivered the painting to the Giocondo family, but instead took it with him to France, where he sold it to King Francis I. This suggests that Leonardo had a personal attachment to the painting and its sitter[^3^].\n\nOther theories include that the Mona Lisa is a **self-portrait** of Leonardo in disguise[^4^], a **composite** of several women that Leonardo knew or imagined[^5^], or an **idealized** representation of feminine beauty[^5^]. However, these theories have less historical or visual evidence to support them, and are mostly based on speculation or interpretation. The mystery of the Mona Lisa's identity and smile may never be fully resolved, but that is part of what makes the painting so fascinating and captivating.",

              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the Mona Lisa\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous possibilities, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo\u2014hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "The Mona Lisa hangs behind bulletproof glass in a gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it has been a part of the museum\u2019s collection since 1804.",
              "It was part of the royal collection before becoming the property of the French people during the Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "The Mona Lisa is priceless.",
              "Any speculative price (some say over a billion dollars!)",
              "would probably be so high that not one person would be able or willing to purchase and maintain the painting.",
              "Moreover, the Louvre Museum would probably never sell it.",
              "The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for the Mona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment.",
              "Indeed, the museum considers the Mona Lisa irreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.",
              "Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece\u2019s celebrity, including its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and its tour to the U.",
              "S.",
              "in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.",
              "The Mona Lisa\u2019s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting\u2019s inherent appeal.",
              "Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world\u2019s most famous painting.",
              "It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century.",
              "The sitter\u2019s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.",
              "The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape.",
              "Yet this simple description of a seemingly standard composition gives little sense of Leonardo\u2019s achievement.",
              "The three-quarter view, in which the sitter\u2019s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century.",
              "The subject\u2019s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo\u2019s skillful handling of sfumato (use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin.",
              "The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo\u2019s studied observations and inexhaustible patience.",
              "Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter\u2019s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.",
              "The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting\u2014especially apparent in the sitter\u2019s faint smile\u2014reflects Leonardo\u2019s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo\u2019s vision.",
              "In its exquisite synthesis of sitter and landscape, the Mona Lisa set the standard for all future portraits.",
              "There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of the portrait\u2019s sitter.",
              "Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (ne\u0301e Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence the alternative title to the work, La Gioconda.",
              "That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographer Giorgio Vasari.",
              "Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo\u2019s mother, Caterina.",
              "That interpretation was put forth by, among others, Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa\u2019s mysterious smile emerged from a\u2014perhaps unconscious\u2014memory of Caterina\u2019s smile.",
              "A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo\u2019s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter\u2019s and the artist\u2019s facial features.",
              "Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist\u2019s riddle.",
              "The sitter\u2019s identity has not been definitively proven.",
              "Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo\u2019s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa about 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.",
              "He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.",
              "Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo\u2019s late period.",
              "French King Francis I, in whose court Leonardo spent the last years of his life, acquired the work after the artist\u2019s death, and it became part of the royal collection.",
              "For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during the French Revolution (1787\u201399).",
              "Following a period hanging in Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, the Mona Lisa was installed in the Louvre Museum at the turn of the 19th century.",
              "In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation.",
              "People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum\u2019s director of paintings resigned, and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and artist Pablo Picasso were even arrested as suspects.",
              "Two years later an art dealer in Florence alerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting.",
              "Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging to Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including the Mona Lisa.",
              "He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off without suspicion.",
              "Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while the Mona Lisa took a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.",
              "During World War II the Mona Lisa, singled out as the most-endangered artwork in the Louvre, was evacuated to various locations in France\u2019s countryside, returning to the museum in 1945 after peace had been declared.",
              "It later traveled to the United States in 1963, drawing about 40,000 people per day during its six-week stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              "It also toured to Tokyo and Moscow in 1974.",
              "Scholars have noted that the Mona Lisa is in fairly good condition for its age.",
              "The poplar panel shows some evidence of warping from resistance to its original frame and to braces added by early restorers.",
              "To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting.",
              "Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail.",
              "The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject\u2019s left elbow.",
              "The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work\u2019s visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it."

              "[23] The Italian name for the painting, La Gioconda, means 'jocund' ('happy' or 'jovial') or, literally, 'the jocund one', a pun on the feminine form of Lisa's married name, Giocondo.",
              "[22][24] In French, the title La Joconde has the same meaning.",

              "Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci.",

              "[26] The catalogue raisonne\u0301 Leonardo da Vinci (2019) confirms that the painting probably depicts Lisa del Giocondo, with Isabella d'Este being the only plausible alternative.",
              "[27] Scholars have developed several alternative views, arguing that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, and identifying at least four other paintings referred to by Vasari as the Mona Lisa.",
              "[28] Several other people have been proposed as the subject of the painting,[29] including Isabella of Aragon,[30] Cecilia Gallerani,[31] Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla,[29] Pacifica Brandano/Brandino, Isabella Gualanda, Caterina Sforza, Bianca Giovanna Sforza, Salai\u0300, and even Leonardo himself.",

              "Her gaze is fixed on the observer.",
              "The woman appears alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines (sfumato).",
              "The soft blending creates an ambiguous mood \"mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes\".",
              "[38] The depiction of the sitter in three-quarter profile is similar to late 15th-century works by Lorenzo di Credi and Agnolo di Domenico del Mazziere.",
              "[37] Zo\u0308llner notes that the sitter's general position can be traced back to Flemish models and that \"in particular the vertical slices of columns at both sides of the panel had precedents in Flemish portraiture.\"",
              "[39] Woods-Marsden cites Hans Memling's portrait of Benedetto Portinari (1487) or Italian imitations such as Sebastiano Mainardi's pendant portraits for the use of a loggia, which has the effect of mediating between the sitter and the distant landscape, a feature missing from Leonardo's earlier portrait of Ginevra de' Benci.",
              "[40] The painting was one of the first Italian portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape,[42] and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective.",
              "[43] The enigmatic woman is portrayed seated in what appears to be an open loggia with dark pillar bases on either side.",
              "Behind her, a vast landscape recedes to icy mountains, winding paths and a distant bridge, giving only the slightest indications of human presence.",
              "Leonardo has chosen to place the horizon line not at the neck, as he did with Ginevra de' Benci, but on a level with the eyes, thus linking the figure with the landscape and emphasizing the mysterious nature of the painting.",
              "[40] The bridge in the background was identified by Silvano Vincenti as the four-arched Romito di Laterina bridge from Etruscan-Roman times near Laterina, Arezzo over the Arno river.",
              "[44] Other bridges with similar arches suggested as possible locations had more arches.",
              "[44] Mona Lisa has no clearly visible eyebrows or eyelashes, although Vasari describes the eyebrows in detail.",
              "[45][a] In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning.",
              "[48] Cotte discovered that the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made to the size of the face and the direction of gaze.",
              "He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.",
              "[49] There has been much speculation regarding the painting's model and landscape.",
              "For example, Leonardo probably painted his model faithfully since her beauty is not seen as being among the best, \"even when measured by late quattrocento (15th century) or even twenty-first century standards.\"",
              "[50] Some historians in Eastern art, such as Yukio Yashiro, argue that the landscape in the background of the picture was influenced by Chinese paintings,[51] but this thesis has been contested for lack of clear evidence.",
              "[51] Research in 2003 by Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University said that Mona Lisa's smile disappears when observed with direct vision, known as foveal.",
              "Because of the way the human eye processes visual information, it is less suited to pick up shadows directly;",
              "however, peripheral vision can pick up shadows well.",
              "[52] Research in 2008 by a geomorphology professor at Urbino University and an artist-photographer revealed that Mona Lisa's landscape was similar to some views in the Montefeltro region in the Italian provinces of Pesaro and Urbino, and Rimini.",
              "[53][54] Of Leonardo da Vinci's works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned,[55] and one of four works \u2013 the others being Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, Adoration of the Magi and The Last Supper \u2013 whose attribution has avoided controversy.",
              "[56] He had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the model of the Mona Lisa, by October 1503.",
              "[25][26] It is believed by some that the Mona Lisa was begun in 1503 or 1504 in Florence.",
              "[57] Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\",[8] art historian Martin Kemp says that there are some difficulties in confirming the dates with certainty.",
              "[22] Alessandro Vezzosi believes that the painting is characteristic of Leonardo's style in the final years of his life, post-1513.",
              "[58] Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513.",
              "[59] According to Vasari, \"after he had lingered over it four years, [he] left it unfinished\".",
              "[18] In 1516, Leonardo was invited by King Francis I to work at the Clos Luce\u0301 near the Cha\u0302teau d'Amboise;",

              "[75] In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th-century Italian painting at the Louvre, states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version,[76] while Zo\u0308llner states that the sketch may be after another Leonardo portrait of the same subject.",
              "[74] The record of an October 1517 visit by Louis d'Aragon states that the Mona Lisa was executed for the deceased Giuliano de' Medici, Leonardo's steward at Belvedere, Vienna, between 1513 and 1516[77][78][c]\u2014but this was likely an error.",
              "[79][d] According to Vasari, the painting was created for the model's husband, Francesco del Giocondo.",
              "[80] A number of experts have argued that Leonardo made two versions (because of the uncertainty concerning its dating and commissioner, as well as its fate following Leonardo's death in 1519, and the difference of details in Raphael's sketch\u2014which may be explained by the possibility that he made the sketch from memory).",

              "To prevent the widening of a small crack, visible near the centre of the upper edge of the painting, dovetails were added to the back of the painting.",
              "Restorers later pasted heavy canvas over the crack and replaced the top dovetail.",
              "The glass protecting the Mona Lisa was replaced with a bulletproof case after several attacks in 1956, one of which damaged an area near the subject\u2019s left elbow.",
              "The Mona Lisa thus escaped harm from acts of vandalism in 1974 during the work\u2019s visit to Tokyo and in 2009 when a museumgoer threw a ceramic mug at it."

              "The work is arguably the finest ever example of portrait art, and one of the greatest Renaissance paintings of the 15th and 16th centuries.",
              "Despite being the most famous painting in the world, the Mona Lisa is - like all of Leonardo's works - neither signed nor dated.",
              "Its title comes from the biography of Leonardo written by the 16th century Mannerist painter and biographer Giorgio Vasari (1511-74), and published around 1550, which reported his agreement to paint the portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo, a Florentine dignitary and wealthy silk merchant.",
              "Vasari also mentioned that Leonardo employed musicians and troubadours to keep her amused, which might explain her enigmatic smile.",
              "As usual, Leonardo procrastinated endlessly over the painting - notably the position of the subject's hands - and continued working on it for another 20 years.",
              "Sadly, La Gioconda has become so famous and so valuable that it is almost impossible to catch more than a quick glimpse of her, as she sits inscrutably in the Louvre behind the non-reflective glass of her temperature-controlled security box.",
              "More Analysis of Mona Lisa The portrait shows the subject sitting upright and sideways in a chair, with her face and chest turned slightly towards the viewer: a posture derived from the 'pyramid' image used to depict a sitting Madonna.",
              "Her left arm sits comfortably on the armrest of the chair and is clasped by the hand of her right arm which crosses her front.",
              "The slightly protective position of her arms, as well as the armrest, creates a sense of distance between sitter and spectator.",
              "The background landscape behind the sitter was created using aerial perspective, with its smoky blues and no clearly defined vanishing point.",
              "It gives the composition significant depth, although its details reveal a clear imbalance between the (higher) rocky horizon to the right, compared to the (lower) flatlands stretching away on the left.",
              "This imbalance adds to the slightly surreal atmosphere of the picture.",
              "Another slightly surreal feature of the Mona Lisa is her lack of eyebrows and eyelashes.",
              "This was not a deliberate act of the artist, as scans indicate that originally she was given both.",
              "It is possible that the colour pigment used for these facial features has since faded or been inadvertently removed during cleaning.",
              "The Mona Lisa exemplifies Leonardo's contribution to the art of oil painting, namely his mastery of sfumato.",
              "This painterly technique involves the smooth, almost imperceptible, transition from one colour to another, by means of ultra-subtle tonal gradations.",
              "Evident throughout the painting, Leonardo's use of sfumato is particularly visible in the soft contouring of Lisa Gherardini's face, around the eyes and mouth.",
              "It was a technique of oil painting that he had already demonstrated with great success in The Virgin of the Rocks (1483-5).",
              "The general impression created by the Mona Lisa portrait is one of great serenity, enriched by a definite air of mystery.",
              "The serenity comes from the muted colour scheme, the soothing sfumato tonality, and the harmony created by the sitter's pyramid-shaped pose and understated drapery.",
              "The mystery stems from a number of factors: first, her enigmatic half-smile;",
              "second, her gaze, which is directed to the right of the viewer;",
              "her hands which have a slightly unreal, lifeless quality - almost as if they belonged to a different body.",

              "The two\u2013Mona Lisa theory is a longstanding theory proposed by various historians, art experts, and others that Leonardo da Vinci painted two versions of the Mona Lisa.",
              "[2][3][4] Several of these experts have further concluded that examination of historical documents indicates that one version was painted several years before the second.",
              "The journalist Dianne Hales has noted that \"the two\u2013Mona Lisa theory has been around a long time\",[2] observing that the sixteenth-century painter and art theorist Gian Paolo Lomazzo identifies two versions of the painting in his 1584 Treatise on Painting.",
              "[2] The theory itself may be impossible to definitively prove or disprove, but proponents of the theory highlight a number of pieces of documentary and physical evidence.",
              "Among these is the fact that there are several paintings of which Leonardo is known to have painted two versions, and historical accounts such as Lomazzo's writing suggesting that Leonardo similarly worked on two paintings, a Gioconda and a Mona Lisa.",
              "Furthermore, various accounts contain inconsistencies and incompatibilities with respect to the dates when Leonardo began and ended work on the painting, by whom it was commissioned, the state of completion in which it was left, and what ultimately became of it.",
              "These inconsistencies and incompatibilities are asserted to be broadly resolved with the explanation that there were two versions of the painting having different dates of initiation and states of completion, painted for different patrons, and having different profiles and fates.",
              "Also cited as a key piece of evidence is a contemporaneous sketch of the painting by Raphael, who observed the painting while visiting Leonardo's studio.",
              "The sketch contains characteristics differing from the Mona Lisa in the Louvre, including prominent columns that were initially argued to have been trimmed from the original.",
              "However, in 1993 it was demonstrated that the painting in the Louvre had never been trimmed, bolstering claims that Raphael saw a different version of the painting.",
              "Other descriptions by eyewitnesses and others living in the period have also been read as indicating that Leonardo painted two paintings of the subject of the Mona Lisa, with several characteristics differing from the painting in the Louvre.",
              "The author John R.",
              "Eyre made an extensive case for the theory in his 1915 Monograph on Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa,[3] and Le\u0301on Roger-Mile\u0300s made a similar case in his 1923 book, Leonard de Vinci et les Jocondes.",
              "[4] Several more recent examinations of the evidence have led other authors to similar conclusions.",
              "While it is possible that a first version was produced by Leonardo and later lost or destroyed, proponents of the theory have identified a number of existing alternative versions of the Mona Lisa as candidates for having also been painted by Leonardo.",
              "These include versions more similar to the original such as the Prado Mona Lisa, but more particularly those versions that closely resemble Raphael's sketch and other historical accounts, such as the Vernon Mona Lisa (which is no longer considered a candidate after tests showed that it was painted after Leonardo's death), and the Isleworth Mona Lisa, the latter having received the most substantial support.",
              "[5][6][7][8][9] A number of authors have noted that Leonardo often painted two versions of his works, and also often left works unfinished, leaving his students to complete the missing portions.",
              "For example, Frank Zo\u0308llner wrote of Leonardo's two versions of the Virgin of the Rocks,[10] and Eyre, in his 1915 monograph, wrote that Leonardo \"almost invariably commenced two versions of each of his works, which he rarely finished\", citing the Virgin of the Rocks along with two versions of Saint John the Baptist and of Leda and the Swan, and two versions each of drawings of Isabella d'Este, the Adoration of the Magi, and Saint Anne.",
              "[3]: 12 Dianne Hales quotes the sixteenth-century painter and art theorist Gian Paolo Lomazzo as identifying two versions of the painting: \"In 1584, in his Treatise on Painting, the Florentine artist and chronicler Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo, a supposed acquaintance of Leonardo's longtime secretary Melzi, wrote that 'the two most beautiful and important portraits by Leonardo are the Mona Lisa and the Gioconda'\".",
              "[2] Another statement considered as evidence for this purpose was made by Fra Pietro da Novellara in a 1501 letter to Isabella d'Este, Marchesa of Mantua, detailing Leonardo's activities from a visit to his studio.",
              "Fra Pietro states in the letter that \"[t]wo of his pupils are painting portraits, and he touches them up from time to time\".",
              "[11][12] Eyre and Euge\u0300ne Mu\u0308ntz both discuss Fra Pietro's letter, with Mu\u0308ntz deeming the subjects unknown,[13] and Eyre concluding that these were portraits of Lisa del Giocondo.",
              "A number of experts have argued that Leonardo made two versions based on the differences in details in Raphael's sketch.",
              "[1][7][8] Circa 1505,[1] Raphael executed a pen-and-ink sketch, in which columns flanking the subject are substantially more apparent.",
              "Experts universally agree that this sketch was based on Leonardo's portrait.",
              "[14][7][9] Other later copies of the Mona Lisa, such as those in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design and The Walters Art Museum, also display large flanking columns.",
              "As a result, it was thought that the Mona Lisa had been trimmed.",
              "[15][16][17][18] However, by 1993, Frank Zo\u0308llner observed that the painting surface had never been trimmed;",
              "[19] this was confirmed through a series of tests in 2004.",
              "[20] In view of this, the art historian Vincent Delieuvin, curator of sixteenth-century Italian painting at the Louvre, states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version,[21] while Zo\u0308llner states that the sketch may be after another Leonardo portrait of the same subject.",
              "[19] Disparate dates proposed for the initiation and completion or abandonment of the Mona Lisa are claimed to indicate that there were actually two different paintings worked on at different times, with one version being begun in 1503 and left unfinished, and the Louvre Mona Lisa being begun after 1513.",
              "Specifically, it is believed by some that Leonardo da Vinci had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the model of the Mona Lisa, in Florence by October 1503.",
              "[22] [23][24] Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\",[25] Leonardo experts such as Carlo Pedretti and Alessandro Vezzosi are of the opinion that the Louvre painting is characteristic of Leonardo's style in the final years of his life, post-1513.",
              "[26][27] Other academics argue that historical documentation indicates that Leonardo would have painted the work in the Louvre from 1513.",
              "[28] In 2005, a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume by the ancient Roman philosopher Cicero.",
              "The note was dated October 1503, and was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci.",
              "This note likens Leonardo to the renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.",
              "[22] In response, Delieuvin stated \"Leonardo da Vinci was painting, in 1503, the portrait of a Florentine lady by the name of Lisa del Giocondo.",
              "About this we are now certain.",
              "Unfortunately, we cannot be absolutely certain that this portrait of Lisa del Giocondo is the painting of the Louvre\".",
              "[29] The art historian Martin Kemp, while doubting the two-painting theory, nevertheless notes difficulties in confirming the dates with certainty,[30] and the sixteenth-century biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote of Leonardo's work on the Mona Lisa that \"after he had lingered over it four years, [he] left it unfinished\",[14] though the painting in the Louvre appears to be a finished piece.",
              "Proponents of the theory explain that the hypothetical first portrait, displaying prominent columns, would have been commissioned by Giocondo circa 1503, of a younger sitter (Lisa del Giocondo being 23 years old in 1503), and left unfinished in the possession of Leonardo's pupil and assistant Salai\u0300 until Salai\u0300's death in 1524.",
              "The second, commissioned by Giuliano de' Medici circa 1513, would have been sold by Salai\u0300 to Francis I of France in 1518[a] and is the one in the Louvre today.",
              "[9][7][8][31] Notably, even those who believe that there was only one true Mona Lisa have been unable to agree between the two aforementioned fates, or to otherwise account for the incompatibility of the facts of record with only one painting.",
              "[30][32][33] Different sources provide inconsistent information about the identity of the patron for whom the Mona Lisa was painted.",
              "In his 1923 book, Leonard de Vinci et les Jocondes, Le\u0301on Roger-Mile\u0300s argues that Leonardo actually painted at least two versions of the Mona Lisa, including one for Francesco del Giocondo, and another for Giuliano de' Medici.",
              "[4] According to Vasari, the painting was created for the model's husband, Francesco del Giocondo.",
              "[34][35] However, the record of an October 1517 visit by Louis d'Aragon states that the Mona Lisa was executed for the deceased Medici, Leonardo's steward at the Belvedere Palace between 1513 and 1516.",
              "[36][37][b]\u2014though some have suspected this to be an error, hypothesizing that this refers to yet another portrait by Leonardo \"of which no record and no copies exist\".",
              "[38][c] Scholars have also developed several alternative views as to the subject of the painting, with some historically having argued that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different Leonardo portrait, and identifying at least four other paintings as the Mona Lisa referenced by Vasari.",
              "[39][40] Several other women have been proposed as the subject of the painting in the Louvre.",
              "[41] Isabella of Aragon,[42] Cecilia Gallerani,[43] Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla,[41] Isabella d'Este, Pacifica Brandano or Brandino, Isabella Gualanda, Caterina Sforza, Bianca Giovanna Sforza\u2014even feminized versions of Salai\u0300 and Leonardo himself\u2014are all among the list of posited models portrayed in the painting.",
              "[44][45][46] Based on this assertion, it is proposed that Leonardo painted a different painting actually depicting Lisa del Giocondo.",
              "One previously cited item that appears to have been resolved is the state of the eyebrows or eyelashes of the Mona Lisa.",
              "Eyre noted that the absence of these features in the Louvre's Mona Lisa is contrary to Vasari's description of the eyebrows on the painting, that '\"[t]hey spring from the flesh, their varying thickness, the manner in which they curve according to the pores of the skin, could not have been rendered in a more natural fashion\".",
              "[3]: 22\u201323 Some researchers accounted for this disparity by asserting that the subject never had eyebrows, and that it was common at this time for genteel women to pluck these hairs, as they were considered unsightly.",
              "[47][48][3]: 23 In 2007, however, the French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra\u2013high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that the Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and with visible eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning.",
              "[49] Vasari also described red lips,[50] of which Cotte was unable to find traces in the Louvre painting.",
              "Cotte discovered that the painting in the Louvre had been reworked several times, with changes made to the size of the sitter's face and the direction of her gaze.",
              "He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.",
              "[51] It is possible that a first version of the Mona Lisa was produced and then lost or destroyed.",
              "However, a number of existing paintings have been identified as possibly being this first version.",
              "The most widely endorsed contender is the Isleworth Mona Lisa, which had been examined by a number of experts in the 1910s and 1920s, and was later hidden in a Swiss bank vault for 40 years before being unveiled to the public on September 27, 2012.",
              "[52] The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich has dated the piece to Leonardo's lifetime, and an expert in sacred geometry has found it to conform to the artist's basic line structures.",
              "[53][54] It also has columns similar to those in the sketch made by Raphael, and the red lips described by Vasari.",
              "In 1988, the physicist John F.",
              "Asmus, who pioneered laser-restoration techniques for Renaissance art, and who had previously examined the Mona Lisa in the Louvre for this purpose, published a computer image processing study concluding that the brush strokes of the face in the Isleworth Mona Lisa were performed by the same artist responsible for the brushstrokes of the face of the Mona Lisa in the Louvre.",
              "[55][56] By the 1970s, Peregrine Cust, 6th Baron Brownlow, also came into possession of a painting which he believed to be another version of the Mona Lisa, and to also have been painted by Leonardo.",
              "[57] Brownlow and Henry F.",
              "Pulitzer, owner of the Isleworth Mona Lisa at that time, genially disputed who had the \"real\" Mona Lisa in the press,[57] and both offered to show their respective Mona Lisa paintings at a London exhibition in 1972.",
              "[58][59] Another claimed version is in the Vernon collection.",
              "[60] The Vernon Mona Lisa, however, dates from around 1616, though it also has columns, and was itself originally part of the collection at the Louvre.",
              "It was given to Joshua Reynolds by the Duke of Leeds around 1790, in exchange for a Reynolds self-portrait.",
              "This version was included in an 1824 \"Account of the Principal Pictures belonging to the Nobility and Gentry of England\", which lists \"The Mona Lisa sitting on a Chair\" as a painting by \"Lionardo da Vinci\";",
              "it was then owned by Sir Abraham Hume.",
              "The account describes the background as \"a Landscape with a Bridge\", and states that \"[i]t is not known how this portrait was brought to England\".",
              "[61] Reynolds thought it to be the real painting and the French one a copy, which was later deemed to have been disproved.",
              "It is, however, useful in that it was copied when the original's colors were far brighter than they are now, and so it gives some sense of the original's appearance \"as new\".",
              "It remains in a private collection, but was exhibited in 2006 at the Dulwich Picture Gallery.",
              "[62] In 2012 the Museo del Prado in Madrid announced that it had discovered and almost fully restored a copy of the painting by a pupil of Leonardo, very possibly painted alongside the master.",
              "[63] The copy gives a better indication of what the portrait looked like at the time, as the varnish on the original has become cracked and yellowed with age.",
              "[64] The German imaging researchers Claus-Christian Carbon of the University of Bamberg and Vera Hesslinger of the University of Mainz performed further analysis of the Prado version, comparing it to Leonardo's Mona Lisa, and in 2014 speculated that, based on perspective analysis of key features in the images, the two images were painted at the same time from slightly different viewpoints.",
              "They further proposed that two images may therefore form a stereoscopic pair, creating the illusion of three-dimensional depth, when viewed side-by-side.",
              "[65] However, a study published in 2017 has demonstrated that this stereoscopic pair in fact gives no reliable stereoscopic depth.",
              "[66] Professor Salvatore Lorusso, who has written several papers and articles comparing these paintings and others, including the Mona Lisa with Columns in Saint Petersburg, and the Oslo Mona Lisa, supported the Isleworth Mona Lisa as one of two original versions by Leonardo, while concluding that the Prado Mona Lisa is likely to have been by one of Leonardo's more talented students, and that the Vernon Mona Lisa was a copy done section-by-section, \"probably painted by a French court artist in Fontainebleau or a visiting artist at the beginning of the 17th century\".",

              "[27] Scholars have developed several alternative views, arguing that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, and identifying at least four other paintings referred to by Vasari as the Mona Lisa.",
              "[28] Several other people have been proposed as the subject of the painting,[29] including Isabella of Aragon,[30] Cecilia Gallerani,[31] Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla,[29] Pacifica Brandano/Brandino, Isabella Gualanda, Caterina Sforza, Bianca Giovanna Sforza, Salai\u0300, and even Leonardo himself.",

              "[37] Zo\u0308llner notes that the sitter's general position can be traced back to Flemish models and that \"in particular the vertical slices of columns at both sides of the panel had precedents in Flemish portraiture.\"",
              "[39] Woods-Marsden cites Hans Memling's portrait of Benedetto Portinari (1487) or Italian imitations such as Sebastiano Mainardi's pendant portraits for the use of a loggia, which has the effect of mediating between the sitter and the distant landscape, a feature missing from Leonardo's earlier portrait of Ginevra de' Benci.",
              "[40] The painting was one of the first Italian portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape,[42] and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective.",

              "[45][a] In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning.",

              "He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.",
              "[49] There has been much speculation regarding the painting's model and landscape.",
              "For example, Leonardo probably painted his model faithfully since her beauty is not seen as being among the best, \"even when measured by late quattrocento (15th century) or even twenty-first century standards.\"",

              "Many scholars have claimed that in this portrait we are connected to the inner soul of the subject, and that the artist is somehow able to portray their personality through the aesthetics.",
              "Many have been drawn in by the ambiguity of the subject's facial expression, which borders on a smile.",
              "Leonardo would also incorporate elements of chiaroscuro, where light varies considerably from the foreground to the background and this helps to deliver a strong feeling of depth to the painting.",
              "He also takes his landscape work as far as had been seen within this painting, providing a complex myriad of elements which drift off into the distance.",
              "MeaningLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa may not carry the same symbolism that you might find in other genres, but there are secrets within the artwork that you may not initially pick up.",
              "Lisa Gherardini's personality is portrayed through the subtle uplifts around the lips and eyes, giving us an insight into the life of a happy mother and wife.",
              "The artist also combines the features of the landscape with the sitter's clothing and hair, with free flowing material on her sleeves offering a consistent look with the meandering rivers in the far distance.",

              "He also completed some secular portraits which were compositionally-similar to the Mona Lisa in previous decades, such as Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, and many of the qualities found in these paintings would continue into his portrait of Lisa Gherardini.",

              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",

              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",

              "Many have been drawn in by the ambiguity of the subject's facial expression, which borders on a smile.",
              "Leonardo would also incorporate elements of chiaroscuro, where light varies considerably from the foreground to the background and this helps to deliver a strong feeling of depth to the painting.",

              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",
              "LocationLeonardo's Mona Lisa has resided at the Louvre in Paris, France since 1797.",

              "The Mona Lisa would then remain here for around two centuries as part of the growing Royal Collection.",
              "As we head towards the end of the 18th century, the painting would be relocated to Versailles, then back to Paris, before being returned to Versailles.",
              "Eventually it would pass to the Louvre in 1797 and has remained there ever since.",

              "The piece has never received a fall restoration, and any work completed on it in the past has been done so in a relatively subtle manner, meaning most of the work is much the same as when the artist first completed the piece.",
              "Two of the main issues to occur have been the darkening of the varnish which has impacted the clarity of all detail within the painting, as well as some warping to the wooden panel.",
              "Both of these problems are entirely typical of art from the 15th and 16th century, and so restorers are well accustomed to dealing with these type of issues.",
              "Other works have previously been transferred to canvas to avoid other common issues such as woodworm, but the Mona Lisa remains one its original panel of popular wood.",
              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",

              "Many visitors to Da Vinci's studio, as well as some of his own assistants, would sit and produce their own versions of the Mona Lisa, and so it has proven difficult to attribute these different copies accurately.",
              "All three have been received support for also being from Leonardo's hand, though other scholars have also suggested that he was not involved.",
              "Da Vinci did produce multiple versions of the same painting several times, and so it is not impossible that he produced copies of the Mona Lisa, but the more likely scenario is that highly skilled members of his studio created these other versions.",

              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",

              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",
              "LocationLeonardo's Mona Lisa has resided at the Louvre in Paris, France since 1797.",

              "ProvenanceFrancis I of France, or FranA\u0303\u00a7ois Ier (roi de France), would purchase the Mona Lisa fairly early on in its life, possibly as early as 1518.",

              "The Mona Lisa would then remain here for around two centuries as part of the growing Royal Collection.",
              "As we head towards the end of the 18th century, the painting would be relocated to Versailles, then back to Paris, before being returned to Versailles.",
              "Eventually it would pass to the Louvre in 1797 and has remained there ever since.",

              "RestorationLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa remains in fairly good condition, despite the artwork's age.",
              "The piece has never received a fall restoration, and any work completed on it in the past has been done so in a relatively subtle manner, meaning most of the work is much the same as when the artist first completed the piece.",
              "Two of the main issues to occur have been the darkening of the varnish which has impacted the clarity of all detail within the painting, as well as some warping to the wooden panel.",
              "Both of these problems are entirely typical of art from the 15th and 16th century, and so restorers are well accustomed to dealing with these type of issues.",
              "Other works have previously been transferred to canvas to avoid other common issues such as woodworm, but the Mona Lisa remains one its original panel of popular wood.",
              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",

              "Many visitors to Da Vinci's studio, as well as some of his own assistants, would sit and produce their own versions of the Mona Lisa, and so it has proven difficult to attribute these different copies accurately.",
              "All three have been received support for also being from Leonardo's hand, though other scholars have also suggested that he was not involved.",
              "Da Vinci did produce multiple versions of the same painting several times, and so it is not impossible that he produced copies of the Mona Lisa, but the more likely scenario is that highly skilled members of his studio created these other versions.",

              "It was admired for many different reasons, and the most famous artist to learn directly from this piece would be Raphael, who used some of its qualities in portraits such as Young Woman with Unicorn, Portrait of Maddalena Doni, La Velata and Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione.",

              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",

              "He also completed some secular portraits which were compositionally-similar to the Mona Lisa in previous decades, such as Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, and many of the qualities found in these paintings would continue into his portrait of Lisa Gherardini.",
              "SizeLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is 77 cm in height and 53 cm in width (30 inches A\u0303\u0097 21 inches).",
              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",
              "LocationLeonardo's Mona Lisa has resided at the Louvre in Paris, France since 1797.",
              "Its precise location is in Room 711 (Salle des A\u0303\u0089tats) of the Denon wing on Level 1.",
              "It remains the greatest highlight in the permanent collection of the Louvre, and attracts millions of visitors each and every year.",
              "It is joined within this room by The Wedding Feast at Cana, Supper at Emmaus, The Crucifixion, Portrait of a Venetian Woman and Jupiter Hurling Thunderbolts at the Vices by Paolo Veronese, The Pastoral Concert, Woman with a Mirror, Man with a Glove and The Virgin and Child with Saint Catherine and a Shepherd by Titian as well as The Coronation of the Virgin by Tintoretto.",
              "ProvenanceFrancis I of France, or FranA\u0303\u00a7ois Ier (roi de France), would purchase the Mona Lisa fairly early on in its life, possibly as early as 1518.",
              "It would then make its way over to Fontainebleau Palace, where it would be displayed alongside two other artworks by Leonardo, namely Leda and the Swan, La Belle FerronniA\u0303 \u0308re and St John the Baptist.",
              "The Mona Lisa would then remain here for around two centuries as part of the growing Royal Collection.",
              "As we head towards the end of the 18th century, the painting would be relocated to Versailles, then back to Paris, before being returned to Versailles.",
              "Eventually it would pass to the Louvre in 1797 and has remained there ever since.",
              "Having remained in the French Royal family for many centuries, after initially been purchased by King Francis I, the piece is now owned by the French Republic.",
              "It is also considered a cultural asset of great significance and is therefore highly unlikely to be sold.",
              "RestorationLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa remains in fairly good condition, despite the artwork's age.",
              "The piece has never received a fall restoration, and any work completed on it in the past has been done so in a relatively subtle manner, meaning most of the work is much the same as when the artist first completed the piece.",
              "Two of the main issues to occur have been the darkening of the varnish which has impacted the clarity of all detail within the painting, as well as some warping to the wooden panel.",
              "Both of these problems are entirely typical of art from the 15th and 16th century, and so restorers are well accustomed to dealing with these type of issues.",
              "Other works have previously been transferred to canvas to avoid other common issues such as woodworm, but the Mona Lisa remains one its original panel of popular wood.",
              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",
              "Whilst hidden away in storage during WWII, the painting may have suffered somewhat from the alternative conditions but is today given the very best care possible - it is on display behind a bullet proof glass screen which protects against any unruly members of the public.",
              "CopiesA large number of copies of the Mona Lisa exist today.",
              "The three most famous of those are known as the Prado Museum La Gioconda, the Isleworth Mona Lisa and the Hermitage Mona Lisa.",
              "Many visitors to Da Vinci's studio, as well as some of his own assistants, would sit and produce their own versions of the Mona Lisa, and so it has proven difficult to attribute these different copies accurately.",
              "All three have been received support for also being from Leonardo's hand, though other scholars have also suggested that he was not involved.",
              "Da Vinci did produce multiple versions of the same painting several times, and so it is not impossible that he produced copies of the Mona Lisa, but the more likely scenario is that highly skilled members of his studio created these other versions.",
              "LegacyThe Mona Lisa would have a greater influence on the direction of Renaissance art than any artwork by Leonardo da Vinci.",
              "It was admired for many different reasons, and the most famous artist to learn directly from this piece would be Raphael, who used some of its qualities in portraits such as Young Woman with Unicorn, Portrait of Maddalena Doni, La Velata and Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione.",
              "Da Vinci's lifelike portraits had impressed many for several decades but the Mona Lisa represented his greatest achievement, at which point his evolution as a portrait painter was now complete.",
              "All of his innovations with oils were on display within this single piece.",
              "It would be used as a benchmark for all portaiture going forwards, both in terms of precise, lifelike aesthetics as well as the manner in which the artist composed the scene.",
              "Italian art during the Renaissance was famous for the different schools which would put forward their own ideas and styles, each learning from each other, but the Mona Lisa represented the starting point from which all later portrait painters should refer - an unchallengeable, perhaps even perfect display of the visual arts.",
              "Over time the painting's fame would lead to a magical quality falling upon its reputation, with viewers becoming mesmerised by the ambigious qualities of the subject's facial expressions.",
              "It would go on to become the most researched artwork in history too, with academics desperate to uncover new secrets about it for centuries to come.",
              "The World's Most Famous PaintingLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa remains the world's most famous painting of all time.",
              "A number of studies over the past few decades have continually placed this oil painting from the early 16th century as the most well known piece across the world, in a list which is dominated by western art, underlining the spread of western culture across the planet.",
              "Large, High Resolution Images of Mona LisaThe Mona Lisa is famed for its use of subtle tones and the layers of transparent glazes which allowed the artist to create the most lifelike of images for this portrait.",

              "Many scholars have claimed that in this portrait we are connected to the inner soul of the subject, and that the artist is somehow able to portray their personality through the aesthetics.",
              "Many have been drawn in by the ambiguity of the subject's facial expression, which borders on a smile.",
              "Leonardo would also incorporate elements of chiaroscuro, where light varies considerably from the foreground to the background and this helps to deliver a strong feeling of depth to the painting.",

              "He also completed some secular portraits which were compositionally-similar to the Mona Lisa in previous decades, such as Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, and many of the qualities found in these paintings would continue into his portrait of Lisa Gherardini.",
              "SizeLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is 77 cm in height and 53 cm in width (30 inches A\u0303\u0097 21 inches).",
              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",

              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",

              "Large, High Resolution Images of Mona LisaThe Mona Lisa is famed for its use of subtle tones and the layers of transparent glazes which allowed the artist to create the most lifelike of images for this portrait.",

              "The strongest alternative theory put forward as to the identity of the model for the Mona Lisa would have to be Isabella d'Este.",
              "She was well known to Leonardo, as he had worked for her in 1499, and there are a number of commissions for her which he never completed.",
              "Some have suggested that after writing to him about this, perhaps the Mona Lisa was born from that.",
              "There are potential discrepancies between her own image, and that found within this portrait, such as her natural hair colour, and there is also far more evidence in favour of it being Lisa del Giocondo in any case.",
              "It must also be pointed out that the other famous portraits of Isabella d'Este, by Titian and later Rubens, do not accurately resemble what we see in the Mona Lisa, and so this theory seems unlikely.",
              "DescriptionThe model is pictured from the waist up, in what is known as a \"half-length\" portrait.",
              "She is turned two-thirds towards us, and her eyes gaze directly in our direction.",

              "There are rocky structures, areas of natural water, and also a softening of outlines as we push towards the back of the painting.",
              "Typically, his landscapes would slowly merge with the sky above and the artist often wrote about his technical reasons for doing this.",
              "The model's hair is modestly styled and runs straight down to her shoulders, with just the suggesting of curls above her pale shoulders.",
              "She wears a dark gown, though the artist manages to deliver aesthetic interest through the beautifully crafted rolls of material which run along both sleeves.",
              "The clothing itself reminds us of Lisa Gherardini's status within the Italian middle classes, thanks to her marriage several years earlier.",
              "The model within Mona Lisa also wears a veil which many do not immediately spot (it's outline slightly hangs out to our left hand side).",
              "Other than the sprawling landscape at the back, this painting appears relatively straight forward at first glance, but it is the incredible subtleties used by the artist which make it such an accomplished painting.",

              "We see many examples of it in previous decades, but by the time of the Mona Lisa this technique of subtle variations of colour, with delicate layers of transparent glazes, had been perfected.",
              "Many scholars have claimed that in this portrait we are connected to the inner soul of the subject, and that the artist is somehow able to portray their personality through the aesthetics.",
              "Many have been drawn in by the ambiguity of the subject's facial expression, which borders on a smile.",
              "Leonardo would also incorporate elements of chiaroscuro, where light varies considerably from the foreground to the background and this helps to deliver a strong feeling of depth to the painting.",
              "He also takes his landscape work as far as had been seen within this painting, providing a complex myriad of elements which drift off into the distance.",
              "MeaningLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa may not carry the same symbolism that you might find in other genres, but there are secrets within the artwork that you may not initially pick up.",
              "Lisa Gherardini's personality is portrayed through the subtle uplifts around the lips and eyes, giving us an insight into the life of a happy mother and wife.",
              "The artist also combines the features of the landscape with the sitter's clothing and hair, with free flowing material on her sleeves offering a consistent look with the meandering rivers in the far distance.",

              "Technical InformationDateLeonardo da Vinci worked on the Mona Lisa between the years of 1503a\u0302\u0080\u00931506, at which point he would have been in his early fifties.",
              "There is considerable evidence to suggest, however, that he continued to re-visit the work from time to time, making minor adjustments until 1517 at the latest.",

              "He also completed some secular portraits which were compositionally-similar to the Mona Lisa in previous decades, such as Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, and many of the qualities found in these paintings would continue into his portrait of Lisa Gherardini.",
              "SizeLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is 77 cm in height and 53 cm in width (30 inches A\u0303\u0097 21 inches).",
              "This is slightly larger than the artist's related secular portraits of Lady with an Ermine and Ginevra de Benci, which allowed Leonardo to incorporate a greater amount of detail in the background, but without ruining the balance of the painting.",
              "Many visitors to the Louvre are surprised at how \"small\" the Mona Lisa is, but in fact it is correctly sized for a single portrait of the Renaissance era, and entirely consistent with the rest of the artist's career.",
              "Leonardo would only make use of larger panels when the composition required it, such as with The Last Supper, where a huge number of figures were included, with that piece stretching to nine metres in width.",
              "His Virgin of the Rocks stretches to nearly two meters in height, but the lower half of the work features four full-length portraits, and so warrants this larger work area.",
              "In some cases the requirements of the donor will also impact size, and many of the artist's secular portraits were intended to be hung within small, private rooms such as a bedroom, where anything larger would have been entirely inappropriate.",
              "MediumThe Mona Lisa was produced using oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel.",
              "Leonardo da Vinci would have been in his early fifties by the time he started to paint the Mona Lisa, and by this point in his career he had worked with both tempera and oils on multiple occasions.",
              "Indeed, he would regularly combine the two, but over time he started to use tempera less and less, prefering the vivid colours delivered by the oils.",
              "Italian artists had tended to prefer tempera for centuries, including Leonardo's own master, Verrocchio, but the influence of Flemish artists would open their eyes to this exciting alternative which would eventually become the dominant medium within Italian art.",
              "The painting was made on a single thin slice of popular wood.",
              "One small crack is believed to have appeared over time and this is currently held together using a dovetail joint.",
              "The artist used more subtle tones here than perhaps in any other painting from his career, which explains why the artwork took so long whilst still being relatively small.",
              "Leonardo used many transparent layers to create almost unlimited variations in tone, and therefore move towards as lifelike an image as possible.",
              "A varnish was added over the top but over time various materials have changed, altering the colour balance within the painting.",
              "LocationLeonardo's Mona Lisa has resided at the Louvre in Paris, France since 1797.",
              "Its precise location is in Room 711 (Salle des A\u0303\u0089tats) of the Denon wing on Level 1.",
              "It remains the greatest highlight in the permanent collection of the Louvre, and attracts millions of visitors each and every year.",

              "The Mona Lisa would then remain here for around two centuries as part of the growing Royal Collection.",
              "As we head towards the end of the 18th century, the painting would be relocated to Versailles, then back to Paris, before being returned to Versailles.",
              "Eventually it would pass to the Louvre in 1797 and has remained there ever since.",
              "Having remained in the French Royal family for many centuries, after initially been purchased by King Francis I, the piece is now owned by the French Republic.",
              "It is also considered a cultural asset of great significance and is therefore highly unlikely to be sold.",
              "RestorationLeonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa remains in fairly good condition, despite the artwork's age.",
              "The piece has never received a fall restoration, and any work completed on it in the past has been done so in a relatively subtle manner, meaning most of the work is much the same as when the artist first completed the piece.",
              "Two of the main issues to occur have been the darkening of the varnish which has impacted the clarity of all detail within the painting, as well as some warping to the wooden panel.",
              "Both of these problems are entirely typical of art from the 15th and 16th century, and so restorers are well accustomed to dealing with these type of issues.",
              "Other works have previously been transferred to canvas to avoid other common issues such as woodworm, but the Mona Lisa remains one its original panel of popular wood.",
              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",
              "Whilst hidden away in storage during WWII, the painting may have suffered somewhat from the alternative conditions but is today given the very best care possible - it is on display behind a bullet proof glass screen which protects against any unruly members of the public.",
              "CopiesA large number of copies of the Mona Lisa exist today.",
              "The three most famous of those are known as the Prado Museum La Gioconda, the Isleworth Mona Lisa and the Hermitage Mona Lisa.",
              "Many visitors to Da Vinci's studio, as well as some of his own assistants, would sit and produce their own versions of the Mona Lisa, and so it has proven difficult to attribute these different copies accurately.",
              "All three have been received support for also being from Leonardo's hand, though other scholars have also suggested that he was not involved.",
              "Da Vinci did produce multiple versions of the same painting several times, and so it is not impossible that he produced copies of the Mona Lisa, but the more likely scenario is that highly skilled members of his studio created these other versions.",
              "LegacyThe Mona Lisa would have a greater influence on the direction of Renaissance art than any artwork by Leonardo da Vinci.",
              "It was admired for many different reasons, and the most famous artist to learn directly from this piece would be Raphael, who used some of its qualities in portraits such as Young Woman with Unicorn, Portrait of Maddalena Doni, La Velata and Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione.",
              "Da Vinci's lifelike portraits had impressed many for several decades but the Mona Lisa represented his greatest achievement, at which point his evolution as a portrait painter was now complete.",

              "The piece has never received a fall restoration, and any work completed on it in the past has been done so in a relatively subtle manner, meaning most of the work is much the same as when the artist first completed the piece.",
              "Two of the main issues to occur have been the darkening of the varnish which has impacted the clarity of all detail within the painting, as well as some warping to the wooden panel.",

              "Some of the warping of the wood was caused by ill fitting or non-existant frames, which when combined with changing external conditions such as humidity, would inevitably cause the panel to alter shape.",
              "Today the piece is well conserved and given consistent, optimal conditions which should help to avoid any further deterioration in the painting's condition.",
              "The current frame was added in 1909 and chosen as something faithful to the styles of the early 16th century, as well as suitable for the longterm protection of the piece.",

              "Da Vinci did produce multiple versions of the same painting several times, and so it is not impossible that he produced copies of the Mona Lisa, but the more likely scenario is that highly skilled members of his studio created these other versions.",

              "During his stay in Florence, Leonardo lived in the houses next to Palazzo Gondi, which belonged to the Gherardini family.",
              "Vasari himself wrote that \"Lionardo undertook to paint for Francesco del Giocondo the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife, and four years later left it imperfect, which work is now with King Francis of France in Fontainbleu\".",
              "Some doubts have arisen from Vasari's description of the magnificently painted eyebrows (which the Mona Lisa does not have) and the dimples on the cheeks (which are also absent).",
              "However, this can be explained by the particular history of the painting, which followed Leonardo until his death in France and was retouched by the artist for years and years.",

              "And Leonardo, born on 15 April 1542 and registered as illegitimate by his paternal grandfather Antonio in a hamlet near Empoli, whose name he bears, always carried with him - almost as a special memory of his homeland - the portrait of Mona Lisa.",

              "In the night between Sunday 20 and Monday 21 August 1911, the Mona Lisa was stolen.",
              "The French poet Guillame Apollinaire was suspected of the theft.",
              "He was arrested after declaring that he wanted to destroy the masterpieces of all museums to make way for new art and taken to prison on 7 September 1911.",
              "In reality, the theft was carried out by a former employee of the Louvre, Vincenzo Peruggia, from a small village near Luino, who was convinced that the painting belonged to Italy.",
              "He had stolen it, locked himself in a storeroom at night and, after spending the night there, removed the painting in the early morning and left the museum with the portrait under his coat.",
              "He put the work in a suitcase and hid it under the bed in a Parisian guesthouse, kept it for twenty-eight months and then took it back to his home country with the intention of 'giving it to Italy'.",
              "In 1913, he went to Florence to resell the work.",
              "He contacted the Florentine antique dealer Alfredo Geri with a letter signed Leonardo in which he wrote: 'The painting is in my hands, it belongs to Italy because Leonardo is Italian' and offered to return it for a ransom of 500,000 lire.",
              "Intrigued, on 11 December 1913, the antiquarian arranged an appointment in room 20 on the third floor of the Hotel Tripoli in Via de' Cerretani, accompanied by the then director of the Uffizi, Giovanni Poggi.",
              "The two realised that the work was authentic.",
              "While waiting, Peruggia went wandering around the city, but was tracked down, arrested and then sentenced to a light sentence because he was \"mentally handicapped\".",
              "His defence was based entirely on patriotism and also aroused sympathy: he himself declared that he had spent two 'romantic' years with the Mona Lisa hanging on his kitchen tableTaking advantage of relations between Italy and France, the recovered painting was exhibited throughout Italy: first at the Uffizi Gallery, then at the French embassy in Palazzo Farnese in Rome and at the Galleria Borghese, and finally at the Pinacoteca di Brera before its definitive return to the Louvre.",

              "This copy is linked to an extraordinary recent discovery: on the occasion of the celebrations for the 500th anniversary of Leonardo's death, deputy director Simona Di Marco studied this painting, considered a nineteenth-century copy of no value, relegated to storage and ignored for a century.",
              "According to initial investigations, it is an ancient copy, not a contemporary one, painted between the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century.",
              "In fact, pigments that could not have been used after the 17th century were used, in particular enamel blue.",
              "Today, the painting is in a precarious condition: the original canvas was first trimmed and then stretched over a larger canvas where 19th-century repainting is evident.",

              "Even the shape of this Mona Lisa\u2019s face seems wrong \u2013 not just because it differs from the Louvre painting but because it doesn\u2019t have the classical proportions or fleshy reality that Renaissance artists aimed for.",
              "Has it been carbon-dated?",
              "It looks like a modern face, though presumably it is a copy done sometime between the 1500s and the 1700s when it is said to have reached Britain.",
              "But it\u2019s a bad copy.",
              "Or a deliberate fake.",
              "The difference in facial appearance, says the Swiss foundation, is that the Isleworth Mona Lisa depicts its subject when she was young.",
              "It claims to have proof that Leonardo did two versions of his masterpiece and this is the first, begun in Florence in 1503.",
              "The history it is presenting to \u201cprove\u201d this is questionable.",
              "The Mona Lisa is a very well-documented painting, and those documents don\u2019t point to the existence of two paintings;",
              "just one, which Leonardo worked on for many years.",
              "Vasari said Leonardo started it in Florence and the subject is Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo.",
              "In 2005, a note was found in a book in Heidelberg University\u2019s library that proves him right: a Florentine government employee wrote in 1503 that Leonardo was working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo.",
              "Was this the Isleworth Mona Lisa or the Louvre one?",
              "The evidence points to it being the boring old version that\u2019s in the Louvre.",
              "For the Mona Lisa Foundation\u2019s argument omits something crucial about this source.",
              "It specifically emphasises that Leonardo\u2019s portrait of Lisa is unfinished \u2013 and doesn\u2019t look like being finished any time soon.",
              "This account of Leonardo making a start and leaving it on his easel while he worked on his inventions matches the creation of the Louvre\u2019s Mona Lisa, which X-rays and other scientific imaging show was built up in a complex, slow way: when Leonardo first painted Lisa, she didn\u2019t even smile.",
              "The painting\u2019s promoters also contend that a drawing of a woman between two pillars by Raphael is a copy of the Isleworth Mona Lisa.",
              "However, when Leonardo started his portrait in 1503, it was an instant sensation.",
              "Raphael saw it in Leonardo\u2019s workshop and immediately started drawing and painting his own variations on it.",
              "This is a drawing for one of those versions in which he portrays a woman in the fashionable Mona Lisa pose.",
              "Does any of this matter?",
              "Not really.",
              "It is magical that an artist who died in 1519 can generate this much fuss.",
              "I very much doubt the owners will end up selling what looks like a poor copy as an authentic Leonardo.",
              "But even if it does become recognised as the young Mona Lisa out of some chaotic mixture of hype, cynicism and romance, it won\u2019t harm Leonardo.",
              "His paintings are portals into his astonishing mental universe, whose true treasures are in his notebooks.",
              "This was a human being who understood fossils and geological time, who dissected and drew our inner landscapes and saw that our very natures would one day be remade by technology.",
              "As for the Mona Lisa \u2013 Leonardo himself started the fictions that swirl around his masterpiece.",
              "When a group of ecclesiastical travellers visited him at Amboise near the end of his life, they were told a cock-and-bull story about the woman on his easel.",
              "Leonardo claimed the Mona Lisa was commissioned by Giuliano de\u2019 Medici \u2013 the son of Lorenzo the Magnificent \u2013 as a portrait of his mistress.",
              "Why?",
              "It was a good story, combining the snob appeal of the Medici name plus a sexy aura of secret love.",
              "Certainly better than simply saying she was a respectable middle-class Florentine.",
              "Leonardo, among all his other brilliances, knew how to sell art and himself.",
              "That\u2019s how he ended up living in a free chateau with his friends at the expense of the king of France.",
              "If he saw this latest fuss about his work, he would probably lend his support to the dubious Isleworth Mona Lisa \u2013 for a cut of the auction price.",

          "They point to facial recognition software and anatomical analyses that suggest the eyes and mouths of both figures share uncanny similarities.",
          "So, while it\u2019s a fascinating theory, it\u2019s like a novel without a final chapter \u2014 riveting but inconclusive.",
          "More recently, artist Lillian Schwartz has used computer programs to identify similarities between the features of the Mona Lisa and those of one of da Vinci\u2019s true self-portraits.",
          "Some scholars suggest that da Vinci\u2019s presumed homosexuality and love of riddles inspired him to paint himself as a woman.",
          "However, speculation surrounds the true identity of the individual, with several other women (including da Vinci\u2019s mother) being candidates."
