    "response": "Sure, I can explain the process of photosynthesis and its importance to the ecosystem. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy that can later be used to fuel their activities[^3^]. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds, such as sugars[^1^] [^2^]. Photosynthesis can be divided into two major stages: light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. The light-dependent reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts, where chlorophyll absorbs light energy and converts it into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH. The light-independent reactions take place in the stroma of the chloroplasts, where carbon dioxide is fixed into carbohydrates using the energy from ATP and NADPH[^1^] [^2^].\n\nPhotosynthesis is very important for the ecosystem because it is the primary source of organic matter and oxygen for most living organisms. Photosynthesis provides food for plants and for animals that eat plants. It also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, which is essential for aerobic respiration. Photosynthesis also helps regulate the carbon cycle and the climate by removing carbon dioxide from the air and storing it in organic molecules[^1^] [^2^]. Without photosynthesis, life on Earth would not be possible.",

              "It is the way in which virtually all energy in the biosphere becomes available to living things.",
              "As primary producers, photosynthetic organisms form the base of Earth\u2019s food webs and are consumed directly or indirectly by all higher life-forms. Additionally, almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is due to the process of photosynthesis.",
              "If photosynthesis ceased, there would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth, most organisms would disappear, and Earth\u2019s atmosphere would eventually become nearly devoid of gaseous oxygen.",
              "The process of photosynthesis is commonly written as: 6CO2 + 6H2O \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6O2.",
              "This means that the reactants, six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules, are converted by light energy captured by chlorophyll (implied by the arrow) into a sugar molecule and six oxygen molecules, the products.",
              "The sugar is used by the organism, and the oxygen is released as a by-product.",
              "The ability to photosynthesize is found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. The most well-known examples are plants, as all but a very few parasitic or mycoheterotrophic species contain chlorophyll and produce their own food.",
              "Algae are the other dominant group of eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms. All algae, which include massive kelps and microscopic diatoms, are important primary producers.",
              "Cyanobacteria and certain sulfur bacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes, in whom photosynthesis evolved.",
              "No animals are thought to be independently capable of photosynthesis, though the emerald green sea slug can temporarily incorporate algae chloroplasts in its body for food production.",

              "During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds.",
              "It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of photosynthesis in the maintenance of life on Earth.",
              "If photosynthesis ceased, there would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth.",
              "Most organisms would disappear, and in time Earth\u2019s atmosphere would become nearly devoid of gaseous oxygen.",
              "The only organisms able to exist under such conditions would be the chemosynthetic bacteria, which can utilize the chemical energy of certain inorganic compounds and thus are not dependent on the conversion of light energy.",
              "Energy produced by photosynthesis carried out by plants millions of years ago is responsible for the fossil fuels (i.",
              "e., coal, oil, and gas) that power industrial society.",
              "In past ages, green plants and small organisms that fed on plants increased faster than they were consumed, and their remains were deposited in Earth\u2019s crust by sedimentation and other geological processes.",
              "There, protected from oxidation, these organic remains were slowly converted to fossil fuels.",
              "These fuels not only provide much of the energy used in factories, homes, and transportation but also serve as the raw material for plastics and other synthetic products.",
              "Unfortunately, modern civilization is using up in a few centuries the excess of photosynthetic production accumulated over millions of years.",
              "Consequently, the carbon dioxide that has been removed from the air to make carbohydrates in photosynthesis over millions of years is being returned at an incredibly rapid rate.",
              "The carbon dioxide concentration in Earth\u2019s atmosphere is rising the fastest it ever has in Earth\u2019s history, and this phenomenon is expected to have major implications on Earth\u2019s climate.",
              "Requirements for food, materials, and energy in a world where human population is rapidly growing have created a need to increase both the amount of photosynthesis and the efficiency of converting photosynthetic output into products useful to people.",
              "One response to those needs\u2014the so-called Green Revolution, begun in the mid-20th century\u2014achieved enormous improvements in agricultural yield through the use of chemical fertilizers, pest and plant-disease control, plant breeding, and mechanized tilling, harvesting, and crop processing.",
              "This effort limited severe famines to a few areas of the world despite rapid population growth, but it did not eliminate widespread malnutrition.",
              "Moreover, beginning in the early 1990s, the rate at which yields of major crops increased began to decline.",
              "This was especially true for rice in Asia.",
              "Rising costs associated with sustaining high rates of agricultural production, which required ever-increasing inputs of fertilizers and pesticides and constant development of new plant varieties, also became problematic for farmers in many countries.",
              "A second agricultural revolution, based on plant genetic engineering, was forecast to lead to increases in plant productivity and thereby partially alleviate malnutrition.",
              "Since the 1970s, molecular biologists have possessed the means to alter a plant\u2019s genetic material (deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) with the aim of achieving improvements in disease and drought resistance, product yield and quality, frost hardiness, and other desirable properties.",
              "However, such traits are inherently complex, and the process of making changes to crop plants through genetic engineering has turned out to be more complicated than anticipated.",
              "In the future such genetic engineering may result in improvements in the process of photosynthesis, but by the first decades of the 21st century, it had yet to demonstrate that it could dramatically increase crop yields.",
              "Another intriguing area in the study of photosynthesis has been the discovery that certain animals are able to convert light energy into chemical energy.",
              "The emerald green sea slug (Elysia chlorotica), for example, acquires genes and chloroplasts from Vaucheria litorea, an alga it consumes, giving it a limited ability to produce chlorophyll.",
              "When enough chloroplasts are assimilated, the slug may forgo the ingestion of food.",
              "The pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) can harness light to manufacture the energy-rich compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP);",
              "this ability has been linked to the aphid\u2019s manufacture of carotenoid pigments.",
              "The study of photosynthesis began in 1771 with observations made by the English clergyman and scientist Joseph Priestley.",
              "Priestley had burned a candle in a closed container until the air within the container could no longer support combustion.",
              "He then placed a sprig of mint plant in the container and discovered that after several days the mint had produced some substance (later recognized as oxygen) that enabled the confined air to again support combustion.",
              "In 1779 the Dutch physician Jan Ingenhousz expanded upon Priestley\u2019s work, showing that the plant had to be exposed to light if the combustible substance (i.",
              "e., oxygen) was to be restored.",
              "He also demonstrated that this process required the presence of the green tissues of the plant.",
              "In 1782 it was demonstrated that the combustion-supporting gas (oxygen) was formed at the expense of another gas, or \u201cfixed air,\u201d which had been identified the year before as carbon dioxide.",
              "Gas-exchange experiments in 1804 showed that the gain in weight of a plant grown in a carefully weighed pot resulted from the uptake of carbon, which came entirely from absorbed carbon dioxide, and water taken up by plant roots;",
              "the balance is oxygen, released back to the atmosphere.",
              "Almost half a century passed before the concept of chemical energy had developed sufficiently to permit the discovery (in 1845) that light energy from the sun is stored as chemical energy in products formed during photosynthesis.",
              "In chemical terms, photosynthesis is a light-energized oxidation\u2013reduction process.",
              "(Oxidation refers to the removal of electrons from a molecule;",
              "reduction refers to the gain of electrons by a molecule.)",
              "In plant photosynthesis, the energy of light is used to drive the oxidation of water (H2O), producing oxygen gas (O2), hydrogen ions (H+), and electrons.",
              "Most of the removed electrons and hydrogen ions ultimately are transferred to carbon dioxide (CO2), which is reduced to organic products.",
              "Other electrons and hydrogen ions are used to reduce nitrate and sulfate to amino and sulfhydryl groups in amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.",
              "In most green cells, carbohydrates\u2014especially starch and the sugar sucrose\u2014are the major direct organic products of photosynthesis.",
              "The overall reaction in which carbohydrates\u2014represented by the general formula (CH2O)\u2014are formed during plant photosynthesis can be indicated by the following equation: This equation is merely a summary statement, for the process of photosynthesis actually involves numerous reactions catalyzed by enzymes (organic catalysts).",
              "These reactions occur in two stages: the \u201clight\u201d stage, consisting of photochemical (i.",
              "e., light-capturing) reactions;",
              "and the \u201cdark\u201d stage, comprising chemical reactions controlled by enzymes.",
              "During the first stage, the energy of light is absorbed and used to drive a series of electron transfers, resulting in the synthesis of ATP and the electron-donor-reduced nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH).",
              "During the dark stage, the ATP and NADPH formed in the light-capturing reactions are used to reduce carbon dioxide to organic carbon compounds.",
              "This assimilation of inorganic carbon into organic compounds is called carbon fixation.",
              "During the 20th century, comparisons between photosynthetic processes in green plants and in certain photosynthetic sulfur bacteria provided important information about the photosynthetic mechanism.",
              "Sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a source of hydrogen atoms and produce sulfur instead of oxygen during photosynthesis.",
              "The overall reaction is In the 1930s Dutch biologist Cornelis van Niel recognized that the utilization of carbon dioxide to form organic compounds was similar in the two types of photosynthetic organisms. Suggesting that differences existed in the light-dependent stage and in the nature of the compounds used as a source of hydrogen atoms, he proposed that hydrogen was transferred from hydrogen sulfide (in bacteria) or water (in green plants) to an unknown acceptor (called A), which was reduced to H2A.",
              "During the dark reactions, which are similar in both bacteria and green plants, the reduced acceptor (H2A) reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) to form carbohydrate (CH2O) and to oxidize the unknown acceptor to A.",
              "This putative reaction can be represented as: Van Niel\u2019s proposal was important because the popular (but incorrect) theory had been that oxygen was removed from carbon dioxide (rather than hydrogen from water, releasing oxygen) and that carbon then combined with water to form carbohydrate (rather than the hydrogen from water combining with CO2 to form CH2O).",
              "By 1940 chemists were using heavy isotopes to follow the reactions of photosynthesis.",
              "Water marked with an isotope of oxygen (18O) was used in early experiments.",
              "Plants that photosynthesized in the presence of water containing H218O produced oxygen gas containing 18O;",
              "those that photosynthesized in the presence of normal water produced normal oxygen gas.",
              "These results provided definitive support for van Niel\u2019s theory that the oxygen gas produced during photosynthesis is derived from water."

              "Specifically, plants are photoautotrophs, because they use the energy from light to produce organic molecules with which they build their cells and store energy.",
              "Organic molecules are compounds associated with living organisms that contain carbon atoms. It was once thought that organic molecules could only be synthesized in nature by living organisms through the intervention of a \u201clife force.",
              "\u201d This hypothesis was disproved in 1828 when urea, a simple organic compound, was synthesized in a laboratory.",
              "Since that time, a major branch of chemistry, organic chemistry, has arisen to study and synthesize organic molecules.",
              "In contrast to organic compounds, inorganic compounds were historically defined as those lifeless minerals that are dug up from the ground.",
              "Note that this chemical definition of organic (containing carbon atoms) has little or no relationship to the contemporary use of the word to describe a method of producing food.",
              "Organic food production, by regulation, relies strictly on inputs of organic molecules that come from life (like manure) and also on inorganic compounds like minerals, and eschews the use of organic molecules that have been synthesized by humans.",
              "The organic molecules that a plant produces must be: Since plants are photoautotrophs, they must have a mechanism for capturing energy from the sun or other sources of light and using that energy to produce organic molecules with the characteristics noted above.",
              "Photosynthesis is the process on which photoautotrophs rely to capture that light energy and to produce carbon-based organic molecules.",
              "The carbon used to make these molecules comes from the carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere.",
              "Because photosynthesis removes carbon from the atmosphere and incorporates it into organic molecules which eventually become the plant\u2019s leaves, stems, roots, and fruits, photosynthesis is sometimes said to fix carbon.",
              "Fix, in this sense, means to secure or sequester rather than to repair.",
              "If you follow the public discourse on climate change, you are aware that global warming is accelerated by the accumulation of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere which trap and re-radiate sunlight and heat back to the earth.",
              "CO2 is one of these greenhouse gasses.",
              "Removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, for instance by planting trees that photosynthesize, fix carbon, and store the carbon-rich product as wood, is one method of carbon sequestration.",
              "An emerging and increasingly popular strategy for remediating greenhouse gas emissions is through the buying and selling of carbon credits, where industries that discharge CO2 into the atmosphere purchase credits from organizations whose activities (such as tree planting) sequester carbon.",
              "Photosynthesis and sequestration of carbon by trees is one tool used to offset the industrial release of CO2.",
              "Let\u2019s start with light, because that\u2019s where the plant gets the energy for photosynthesis.",
              "Here are some characteristics of light: The photons in light provide the energy that drives photosynthesis.",
              "This energy is used to incorporate carbon found in CO2 from the atmosphere into organic molecules and, in particular, into simple sugars used by the plant.",
              "The chemical formula is the same for the two types of simple sugars produced by photosynthesis: glucose and fructose: C6H12O6.",
              "The equation that summarizes photosynthesis is: water + carbon dioxide -> oxygen, water, and simple sugars 12H20 + 6CO2 -> 6O2 + 6H2O + C6H12O6 This balanced equation tells us that 12 molecules of water plus 6 molecules of carbon dioxide, in the presence of chlorophyll, accessory pigments, and light, produces 6 molecules of oxygen gas, returns 6 molecules of water back to the cell, and produces one molecule of a simple sugar like glucose or fructose.",
              "Two reactions make up photosynthesis: the Light Reaction (abbreviated LR) and the Light Independent Reaction (abbreviated LIR).",
              "As the names suggest, the LR requires light while the LIR does not.",
              "The LR uses light energy to split water, which transforms the energy from the sun into hydrogen ions and electrons.",
              "The LIR uses that energy to grab the carbon from carbon dioxide and use the carbon to build simple sugars.",
              "Let\u2019s start with the light reaction.",
              "You\u2019ve heard of chlorophyll, and may recognize this molecule as a green pigment that captures light for photosynthesis.",
              "There are two chlorophyll pigments in plants that are critical for absorbing light: Chlorophyll a and Chlorophyll b.",
              "The graph above shows % absorbance of different wavelengths by these two chlorophylls.",
              "The Y axis (the vertical one) shows the percentage of the light that is absorbed (rather than reflected).",
              "High levels of absorption mean that the chlorophyll molecule uses that wavelength of light for energy.",
              "Low absorption means that the molecule does not use that wavelength, and is thus reflected away.",
              "The X axis indicates the wavelength of light in nanometers (nm) (the wavelength of green light, roughly 500 nm).",
              "The bar at the top represents the color of the light at the wavelength shown.",
              "The blue line is a typical absorption curve for chlorophyll a, while the green line shows chlorophyll b.",
              "High absorbance at a particular wavelength means that pigment is collecting that light at that wavelength to harvest energy.",
              "Low absorbance means that the plant is reflecting that light back.",
              "Both chlorophyll a and b absorb blue and red light wavelengths and reflect green.",
              "Chlorophyll a has a peak in the violet and red regions and chlorophyll b in the blue and orange regions.",
              "Notice how their absorbance is very low in the green region.",
              "That\u2019s why we think of chlorophyll as green, and why we perceive leaves, which have chlorophyll as the predominant pigment, as green.",
              "Also notice that chlorophyll reflects some yellow wavelengths, but when the yellow and deep green wavelengths are mixed, we see the green leaf color.",
              "The graph above shows the absorbance of carotenoid pigments, which are present throughout the growing season.",
              "Carotenoids are called an accessory pigment in photosynthesis.",
              "They assist chlorophyll in light capture and energy transfer, and contribute to the regulation and moderation of excessive excitation of pigment molecules during intense sunlight, including exposure to UV light.",
              "Carotenoids absorb light in the green range, but reflect in yellow and red.",
              "We don\u2019t see these pigments during the growing season because they are much lower in concentration than the chlorophylls, so the green reflected light overwhelms the orange, and we see green.",
              "But when the chlorophyll fades in the fall, due to decomposition of chlorophyll, the orange can be seen in beautiful fall leaf colors.",
              "Chlorophyll a and b, as well as the accessory pigments, are found in the chloroplasts, which are membrane-bound organelles within cells.",
              "The highest concentration of chloroplasts is most commonly found in the palisade mesophyll cells of the leaf.",
              "The above illustration of a chloroplast labels the internal structures.",
              "The chloroplast has a double membrane.",
              "The interior of the chloroplast is called the stroma.",
              "Within the stroma are coin-like thylakoids.",
              "The stacks of thylakoids are called grana.",
              "The thylakoids are also surrounded by a membrane, called the thylakoid membrane.",
              "The green chlorophyll pigment that you associate with photosynthesis, as well as the accessory pigments, are embedded in the thylakoid membranes and arranged in a structure called the antenna complex \u2014 given this name because it captures and routes the energy from sunlight to a collector called a reaction center.",
              "As shown above, when light hits a pigment molecule in the antenna complex, the energy from the light photon promotes (pushes up) an electron in one of the pigment\u2019s atoms to a higher orbital as seen in the cartoon and energy is gained.",
              "The electron can\u2019t stay in that higher orbital indefinitely, and when it drops back to its home orbital it releases the energy it absorbed from light, denoted as energy loss.",
              "This released energy can be passed to another pigment molecule.",
              "This process of one pigment capturing the photon\u2019s energy and passing that energy onto adjacent pigment molecules is the crucial step in energy transformation that takes place in photosynthesis.",
              "This is the step that takes light energy and converts it into chemical energy \u2014 one of the only known biological processes that allows this type of energy transformation.",
              "A light photon excites an electron of one pigment molecule in the antenna complex, or light harvesting complex, and by resonance this energy is transferred from pigment molecule to pigment molecule The energy transfer makes its way to the reaction center, where the first major chemical reaction in photosynthesis \u2014 splitting water \u2014 takes place.",
              "This reaction is called the light reaction or light-dependent reaction because it requires light.",
              "Water is split when the reaction center grabs electrons from water, which separates water into oxygen gas (O2), hydrogen ions (H+), and electrons (e\u2013).",
              "To reiterate, the light is captured by the light harvesting complex (antenna complex) where electrons in the chlorophyll atoms are excited and jump up to a higher orbital.",
              "When the electron drops back, the energy is transferred to an adjacent pigment atom.",
              "This resonance energy travels down the antenna complex to the reaction center, where the captured energy pulls electrons out of water molecules, and water is split into oxygen gas, hydrogen ions, and electrons.",
              "The energy that was present in the photons of light has been transferred to the hydrogen ions and the electrons.",
              "We\u2019ll see more of how that energy is used in the next section.",
              "Recall that the overall equation for photosynthesis is: water + carbon dioxide -> oxygen, water, and simple sugars 12H20 + 6CO2 -> 6O2 + 6H2O + C6H12O6 This equation is made up of two parts called half-reactions.",
              "The first half-reaction is an equation summarizing the Light Reaction, where energy from sunlight is used to split water molecules into oxygen gas, some electrons, and some hydrogen ions.",
              "The energy from sunlight is transferred from the pigments to these hydrogen ions and electrons.",
              "The half-reaction for the Light Reaction is as follows: 12H2O -> 6O2 + 24e\u2013 + 24H+ The Light-Independent Reaction (LIR) is the second part of photosynthesis.",
              "It takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.",
              "Unlike the Light Reaction, it does not require light.",
              "In the LIR, two compounds, NADPH and ATP, carry the energy from light that was originally transformed into hydrogen ions and electrons through the splitting of water.",
              "The NADPH and ATP, along with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, enter a process called the Calvin Cycle, where the energy is used to fix carbon into a molecule abbreviated G3P.",
              "This process requires the help of an important protein abbreviated RuBisCO (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) that catalyzes the step in the process where the carbon from atmospheric CO2 is incorporated into an organic molecule.",
              "RuBisCO is the most abundant protein in leaves and, given the number of leaves in the world, likely the most abundant protein on the planet.",
              "The G3P produced by the carbon fixation process is called a triose phosphate, meaning it is a 3-carbon sugar (triose) with phosphorus and oxygen atoms (phosphate) attached.",
              "Triose phosphate moves out of the chloroplast into the mesophyll cell\u2019s cytoplasm, where two of these three-carbon molecules are combined to produce the 6-carbon molecules glucose and fructose.",
              "The glucose and fructose molecules then combine to form sucrose, a 12-carbon organic molecule.",
              "Sucrose is important because it is the sugar that is transported by the phloem throughout the plant to provide energy and building blocks for other organic molecules like starch and cellulose.",
              "The half-reaction for the LIR is: 24H+ + 24e\u2013 + 6CO2 -> C6H12O6 + 6H2O When we add the two half-reaction equations for LR and LIR together, we get back to the summary equation for photosynthesis: 12H2O + 6CO2 -> 6O2 + 6H2O + C6H12O6 The illustration above is a summary of what happens in a mesophyll cell.",
              "The rectangular blue outline represents a palisade mesophyll cell in a leaf.",
              "Inside the cell is a green rectangle, representing a chloroplast.",
              "Inside the chloroplast is a stack of green ovals with black dots.",
              "These ovals are the thylakoids, and the stacks are grana.",
              "The black dots in the green thylakoid membrane represent the antenna complexes.",
              "Light hits the antenna complex and transfers its energy to pigments, and the energy is funneled to the reaction center where water (H2O) is split in the light reaction to form the energy carriers ATP and NADPH.",
              "This is the Light Reaction.",
              "The waste product formed at this stage is oxygen, which might be waste for the plant, but is quite useful for us.",
              "In the Light Independent Reaction the energy is carried to the Calvin Cycle, represented by the multi-pointed star in the chloroplast, which uses the energy in ATP, the NADPH, and CO2 from the atmosphere to form the three-carbon G3P triose phosphate with the help of RuBisCO.",
              "Triose phosphate leaves the chloroplast and passes into the cytoplasm of the mesophyll cell to be transformed into glucose and fructose, which are combined into sucrose that is exported from the mesophyll cell to the phloem.",
              "Within a plant, the regions of photosynthesis and sugar production are called the source.",
              "Leaves are typically the main source within the plant, since that is where most photosynthesis takes place.",
              "Those regions that do not support photosynthesis (like roots), but that still need organic molecules to survive, are called sinks.",
              "Movement of solutes (molecules dissolved in water) like sucrose from source to sink through the phloem is called translocation.",
              "Translocation of sucrose through the phloem to the sink provides cells with a source of stored energy, and also building blocks for organic molecules, as noted earlier.",
              "Sucrose can be broken down to glucose and fructose, building blocks used to form other extremely useful organic compounds.",
              "Two particularly useful compounds result from the production of long glucose chains: starch, a key energy storage compound in plant cells, and cellulose, the main constituent of the cell wall and key to a plant\u2019s structural integrity.",
              "Wood, for instance, is primarily made up of the cellulose-rich cell walls of dead xylem.",
              "Both starch and cellulose are long chains of glucose, but they differ in the way the glucose molecules are linked together.",
              "Cellulose is the molecule into which carbon extracted from atmospheric CO2 is sequestered for long-term storage.",
              "Starch sequesters carbon for a much shorter period of time because it is either eaten, used by the plant for new growth, or decomposed by bacteria and fungi that can utilize starch for energy.",
              "Some of the explanations and pictures used in this lecture came from Introduction to photosynthesis and other pages at that McDaniel College site.",

              "As primary producers, photosynthetic organisms form the base of Earth\u2019s food webs and are consumed directly or indirectly by all higher life-forms. Additionally, almost all the oxygen in the atmosphere is due to the process of photosynthesis.",

              "The process of photosynthesis is commonly written as: 6CO2 + 6H2O \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6O2.",
              "This means that the reactants, six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules, are converted by light energy captured by chlorophyll (implied by the arrow) into a sugar molecule and six oxygen molecules, the products.",

              "e., coal, oil, and gas) that power industrial society.",
              "In past ages, green plants and small organisms that fed on plants increased faster than they were consumed, and their remains were deposited in Earth\u2019s crust by sedimentation and other geological processes.",
              "There, protected from oxidation, these organic remains were slowly converted to fossil fuels.",
              "These fuels not only provide much of the energy used in factories, homes, and transportation but also serve as the raw material for plastics and other synthetic products.",
              "Unfortunately, modern civilization is using up in a few centuries the excess of photosynthetic production accumulated over millions of years.",
              "Consequently, the carbon dioxide that has been removed from the air to make carbohydrates in photosynthesis over millions of years is being returned at an incredibly rapid rate.",
              "The carbon dioxide concentration in Earth\u2019s atmosphere is rising the fastest it ever has in Earth\u2019s history, and this phenomenon is expected to have major implications on Earth\u2019s climate.",
              "Requirements for food, materials, and energy in a world where human population is rapidly growing have created a need to increase both the amount of photosynthesis and the efficiency of converting photosynthetic output into products useful to people.",

              "Moreover, beginning in the early 1990s, the rate at which yields of major crops increased began to decline.",
              "This was especially true for rice in Asia.",
              "Rising costs associated with sustaining high rates of agricultural production, which required ever-increasing inputs of fertilizers and pesticides and constant development of new plant varieties, also became problematic for farmers in many countries.",
              "A second agricultural revolution, based on plant genetic engineering, was forecast to lead to increases in plant productivity and thereby partially alleviate malnutrition.",
              "Since the 1970s, molecular biologists have possessed the means to alter a plant\u2019s genetic material (deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) with the aim of achieving improvements in disease and drought resistance, product yield and quality, frost hardiness, and other desirable properties.",
              "However, such traits are inherently complex, and the process of making changes to crop plants through genetic engineering has turned out to be more complicated than anticipated.",
              "In the future such genetic engineering may result in improvements in the process of photosynthesis, but by the first decades of the 21st century, it had yet to demonstrate that it could dramatically increase crop yields.",
              "Another intriguing area in the study of photosynthesis has been the discovery that certain animals are able to convert light energy into chemical energy.",
              "The emerald green sea slug (Elysia chlorotica), for example, acquires genes and chloroplasts from Vaucheria litorea, an alga it consumes, giving it a limited ability to produce chlorophyll.",
