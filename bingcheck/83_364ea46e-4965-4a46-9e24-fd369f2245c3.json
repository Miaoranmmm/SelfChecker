              "One of the okapi\u2019s most unusual features is its black tongue.",

              ".",
              ".",
              "An okapi tongue, like a lot of things about this \u2018unicorn of Africa\u2019, is somewhat of an enigma.",
              "120 years since its discovery by the Western world and we still can\u2019t fully explain one of its most renowned features.",
              "An Okapi\u2019s tongue is typically black, although it can look blackish-blue or blackish-purple under certain lighting.",
              "This is very similar to its closest living relative: the giraffe.",
              "Yet people have been thinking why these two animals, which live in completely different habitats, would share the same colour shades of the tongue.",
              "The reason for this strange tongue colour is a heightened amount of melanin (though in this case, it\u2019s specifically eumelanin), which is a broad term for a group of skin pigments.",
              "It\u2019s these pigments that can create darker skin, irises and even hair.",
              "Although they have many functions, a major one is absorbing harmful Ultraviolet/UV radiation.",
              "This protects skin cells against cellular damage from constant and/or intense sunlight exposure.",
              "This protection extends to all forms of UV light including UVA, UVB and UVC, as well as blue light.",
              "Melanin is produced by a specialized kind of cell called melanocytes.",
              "These are mainly found in the outermost layer of the skin.",
              "Upon contact, any of those UV forms are swiftly and ruthlessly absorbed by the melanin before they can harm the sensitive nucleus and therefore DNA of the skin cells.",
              "It\u2019s important they do;",
              "if the radiation reaches the nucleus, mutated cells could be \u2018born\u2019 during cell division or mitosis.",
              "This is how skin cancer spreads.",
              "Since giraffes are always out on the open savannahs, constantly exposing their tongues to the merciless African sun while feeding, the tongues have evolved higher quantities of melanin.",
              "Interestingly, the tone of both giraffe and okapi tongues is darker towards the tip than the back and on the topside compared to the underside.",
              "What\u2019s the explanation for this arrangement of melanin?",
              "These parts of the tongue are most susceptible to UV radiation.",
              "Even though an okapi\u2019s tongue is very similar to a giraffe\u2019s, the two live in very different environments.",
              "Okapis dwell beneath heavily shaded canopies of tropical rainforests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in Central Africa.",
              "Specifically, they reside in the Central, Eastern and Northern of the country, mainly within the Ituri Rainforest and the Maiko National Park.",
              "Due to the dense, lush foliage of the emergency canopy and the understory layers, only about 1-5% of the daily sunlight normally reaches ground level.",
              "To the point where it actually takes longer to notice it\u2019s daytime (or if it\u2019s raining) when you\u2019re on the forest floor than if you were in the upper layers!",
              "This means that ground-dwelling animals in the rainforest almost always live in a dimly-lit atmosphere with sunshine being a scarce sighting.",
              "But then why do okapis still have tongues crammed with melanin just like their giraffe cousins?",
              "This may sound contradictory, but I believe okapis might have their blackened tongues for the same reason as their relatives \u2013 to prevent UV rays from damaging the skin cells of the epidermis.",
              "You might wonder how they can find such lighting with.",
              "The answer is light gaps (also known as tree-fall gaps).",
              "These large holes in the canopy are formed when one or several \u2018emergent trees\u2019 fall over, either because of old age, disease storms or parasites.",
              "These gaps allow light to shine through the canopy reaching down to the forest floor.",
              "And it just so happens the okapi\u2019s feeding habits are perfectly suited to these light gaps.",
              "The falling of an emergent tree is a surprisingly common event in the rainforest and is usually the work of tropical thunderstorms. And without giant emergent trees hogging up all the space and sunlight, there are new opportunities for more sensitive, lower-growing plants to grow and flourish.",
              "For instance, whenever a light gap is formed and the patch of ground below is emptied, it is quickly colonized by several species.",
              "All of which are fast growers but aren\u2019t adapted for a long lifespan.",
              "Expansive clearings are also where the vegetation will be less likely to have defensive adaptations.",
              "With all the extra space, sun, rain and nutrient-rich soil, those plant species can afford to put more time, energy and bodily resources to grow and regrow any parts eaten by hungry herbivores.",
              "Out of those herbivores, the okapi is probably the most prolific when it comes to feasting on understory flora.",
              "And the tongue is a major adaptation for the okapi\u2019s feeding habits.",
              "Again like their giraffe cousins, okapis have tongues that are really long and prehensile.",
              "This means the tongues can actually wrap around and grab things, akin to a person\u2019s hand.",
              "So okapis can use them to delicately pull pieces of foliage off branches and the ground.",
              "They do this technique when feeding sparingly on the 100 or so plant species in their diet!",
              "Feeding only sparingly so to avoid ingesting too much of any one chemical or toxin that might be present in the plants devoured.",
              "Along with the many short, rapid-growing and light-dependent plants found in the light-gaps, okapis sometimes enjoy eating charcoal, clay and bat droppings too.",
              "The reason behind these unusual cravings is because they contain the minerals and salts okapis require.",

              "Okapi: The shy forest dwellers of central Africa",
              "by Thursday, 18 October 2018 The mysterious and enigmatic okapi is one of the oldest mammals on Earth, but it has only been known to the western world since the early 20th century.",
              "Covered in unusual markings on their rump and legs, okapi are elusive, shy and gentle, and nearly impossible to observe in the wild due to their secretive nature.",
              "The Okapi Conservation Project (OCP) has been steadfastly protecting okapi in the Democratic Republic of Congo long before the country became known as such.",
              "Founded in 1987, when the country was called Zaire and under the ruling of Mobutu Sese Seko, the Project struck up a Contract of Collaboration with the Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN) with the agreement to protect the okapi and its habitat through wildlife protection, community assistance and conservation education.",
              "Just five years later in 1992, the OCP, alongside ICCN, the Zaire government and many other partner NGOs, helped develop the Okapi Wildlife Reserve \u2013 a nearly 14,000 km2 World Heritage Site in the Ituri Forest in the northeast of the DR Congo \u2013 dedicated to protecting the largest populations of okapi, forest elephants and chimpanzees.",
              "Once a tourist hotspot under Belgian rule until 1961 when DR Congo gained independence, the town of Epulu is centrally located inside the protected area and where the Okapi Conservation Project is based, along with the ICCN headquarters for the Okapi Wildlife Reserve.",
              "In 2016, the OCP launched a camera trap program aptly named \u2018Team Okapi\u2019 consisting of a group of ICCN rangers, local people and Pygmy guides to place camera traps in strategic locations around the reserve to understand what species exist nearby, the number of individuals, and any other natural history or interesting knowledge gained from capturing stills and video clips from the motion-sensing cameras.",
              "It is possible to identify individual okapi based on their markings, as each okapi has a unique pattern, like human fingerprints.",
              "Camera trapping has the potential to be very useful in determining okapi population size and enhancing current population estimates, as before camera traps the populations were estimated using dung counts.",
              "So far, the results have been fantastic!",
              "After a few trial-runs of learning how to use the cameras, Team Okapi was able to capture the first-ever footage of an okapi feeding in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, and more recently, the first-ever footage of an okapi calf in the wild.",
              "We believe this calf to be the offspring of a pregnant female that was captured on film in December, and that she gave birth immediately following the footage \u2013 and a mere two months later the mother and her calf casually strolled past the camera, much to the delight of the team.",
              "See the first-ever footage to be taken of a wild okapi calf below (\u00a9 Okapi Conservation Project) The okapi\u2019s life and unique behaviours revolve around avoiding their only natural predator \u2013 leopards.",
              "As such, when a female gives birth, the calf finds a safe place to nest and remains there for roughly two months while the mother goes off to feed, ensuring her scent stays away from the youngster.",
              "The calf only leaves the nest to feed when the mother calls using infrasonic sound at a level that both humans and leopards cannot hear.",
              "After those initial eight or so weeks, the calf begins following the mother, continuing to nurse.",
              "This unique behaviour may explain why we did not see the calf for the first few months.",
              "Extracted from IUCN & the Giraffe & Okapi Specialist Group The okapi (Okapia johnstoni), also known as the forest giraffe, Congolese giraffe or zebra giraffe, is an ungulate native to the central and northeastern tropical rainforest of DR Congo.",
              "Although superficially resembling a cross between a zebra and an antelope, the okapi is, in fact, the closest living relative of the giraffe;",
              "together they make up the group known as the giraffids.",
              "An okapi\u2019s short, oily fur acts as waterproofing in the damp rainforest environment.",
              "Their distinctive stripes are thought to act as camouflage by breaking up the outline of the body in the light and shade of the forest understory and are unique to each individual, which helps with identification.",
              "Okapi are one of the few species of mammals where the females are bigger than the males \u2013 the average okapi weighs between 200-300 kg.",
              "They also get to be around 6.",
              "5 feet tall and have an average length of 8 feet!",
              "The dark blue prehensile tongue is adapted for selective browsing and can be up to 18 inches (45 cm) in length, long enough that the animal uses it to clean its own eyes and ears.",
              "Watch an okapi using its tongue to clean itself below (\u00a9 Okapi Conservation Project) Okapi share several characteristics with giraffe, including bilobate canine teeth and skin-covered, horn-like structures called ossicones, which are only present in males.",
              "Okapi derives from the name given to it by the Lese tribes local to the area of its discovery.",

              "Antarctic fishes that manufacture their own \"antifreeze\" proteins to survive in the icy Southern Ocean also suffer an unfortunate side effect, researchers report: The protein-bound ice crystals that accumulate inside their bodies resist melting even when temperatures warm.",
              "The finding is reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
              "\"We discovered what appears to be an undesirable consequence of the evolution of antifreeze proteins in Antarctic notothenioid fishes,\" said University of Oregon doctoral student Paul Cziko, who led the research with University of Illinois animal biology professors Chi-Hing \"Christina\" Cheng and Arthur DeVries.",
              "\"What we found is that the antifreeze proteins also stop internal ice crystals from melting.",
              "That is, they are anti-melt proteins as well.\"",
              "Five families of notothenioid fishes inhabit the Southern Ocean, the frigid sea that encircles Antarctica.",
              "Their ability to live in the icy seawater is so extraordinary that they make up more than 90 percent of the fish biomass of the region.",
              "DeVries discovered antifreeze proteins in Antarctic notothenioid fishes in the late 1960s, and was the first to describe how the proteins bind to ice crystals in the blood to prevent the fishes from freezing.",
              "In the new study, the team investigated whether the antifreeze protein-bound ice crystals inside these fishes would melt as expected when temperatures warmed.",
              "When researchers warmed the fishes to temperatures above the expected melting point, some internal ice crystals failed to melt.",
              "Ice that doesn't melt at its normal melting point is referred to as \"superheated.\"",
              "The researchers also found ice crystals in wild notothenioid fishes swimming in relatively warmer Antarctic summer waters, at temperatures where they would be expected to be free of ice.",
              "By testing the antifreeze proteins in the lab, the team found that these proteins also were responsible for preventing the internal ice crystals from melting.",
              "\"Our discovery may be the first example of ice superheating in nature,\" Cheng said.",
              "A diver himself, Cziko worked with other divers to place and maintain a temperature-logging device in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, one of the coldest marine environments on the planet.",
              "The device recorded ocean temperatures there for 11 years, a substantial portion of notothenioids' lifespan.",
              "Not once in that time did temperatures increase enough to overcome the antifreeze proteins' anti-melting effect to completely rid the fishes of their internal ice, the researchers report.",
              "The researchers suspect that the accumulation of ice inside the fishes could have adverse physiological consequences, but none have yet been discovered.",
              "If the fishes are destined to carry ice crystals around all their lives, Cheng said, it is conceivable that ice particles could obstruct small capillaries or trigger undesired inflammatory responses.",
              "Cziko likens the potential threat to dangers posed by asbestos in the lungs or blood clots in the brain.",
              "\"Since much of the ice accumulates in the fishes' spleens, we think there may be a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation,\" he said.",
              "\"This is just one more piece in the puzzle of how notothenioids came to dominate the ocean around Antarctica,\" he said.",
              "\"It also tells us something about evolution.",
              "That is, adaptation is a story of trade-offs and compromise.",
              "Every good evolutionary innovation probably comes with some bad, unintended effects.\"",
              "The long-term temperature record of McMurdo Sound produced in the study also \"will prove to be of great importance and utility to the polar research community that is addressing organismal responses to climate change in this coldest of all marine environments,\" Cheng said.",

              "One of the most mystifying creatures of the deep, the cuttlefish has abilities and even senses that are alien to us humans.",
              "This versatile animal can change its appearance at will, mimicking floating vegetation or rocks on the seafloor.",
              "Yet when danger looms, the animal can jet away at great speeds, shooting out a smoke screen of ink or using its ink to create decoys of itself.",
              "How does the cuttlefish accomplish all this?",
              "Below, take a look at select parts of this octopus relative and learn more about how this master of deception and disguise functions.",
              "\u2014Rima Chaddha Both the arm (top) and the tentacle (bottom) are lined with suckers.",
              "Arms and TentaclesUnlike the octopus's arms, which that animal often uses to move and carry objects, the cuttlefish's eight arms are specialized for grasping prey after the cuttlefish captures it with its two elongated tentacles.",
              "When potential food sources such as fish or shrimp swim near, the cuttlefish can alter the color of its skin while waving its arms in a mesmerizing display.",
              "This lures potential prey to within reach of the cuttlefish's tentacles, which can then shoot rapidly from a pocket at the base of the arms to grab the prey.",
              "The arms are also important for a defensive display in which the cuttlefish sucks water into its mantle cavity and spreads its arms in order to appear larger to its potential opponent.",
              "The dark area seen here is part of the cuttlefish's strong, sharp beak, the rest of which lies behind the buccal (cheek) mass.",
              "BeakThe cuttlefish's beak looks much like a parrot's beak, but it is hard to see because it lies buried at the base of the animal's eight arms. The cuttlefish can use its beak to help subdue prey and to defend itself against predators and rivals by biting.",
              "Like cuttlebones, beaks differ among species, and their remains enable scientists to identify which cuttlefish species have lived and died in certain areas.",
              "Unlike in mammals, the cuttlefish's optic lobes are located outside of its cartilage brain casing.",
              "Above, a transverse cross-section of the cuttlefish brain.",
              "BrainThe cuttlefish has one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of any invertebrate, perhaps even larger than that of the octopus.",
              "The cuttlefish brain can handle input from a variety of senses, including sight, smell, and even \"sound\" (in the form of pressure waves).",
              "According to some scientists studying cephalopod learning, the cuttlefish can use visual clues to solve mazes, making it as intelligent as the octopus or land animals like the pigeon.",
              "The rigid cuttlebone allows the cuttlefish to keep a constant internal volume, unlike a fish's swim bladder, which expands and contracts with depth.",
              "CuttleboneA defining characteristic of the cuttlefish, the cuttlebone is a porous internal shell that helps control buoyancy, making it functionally similar to swim bladders in fish.",
              "Cuttlebones have both gas-filled forward chambers and water-filled rear chambers.",
              "Although it can take hours for the cuttlefish to change its density through its cuttlebone alone, the animal can control its positioning in the water with the aid of its specialized fins and mantle.",
              "The cuttlebone is rich in calcium and is often sold in pet stores as a nutritional supplement for birds.",
              "A cuttlefish looks on through its large eye.",
              "Note the clear \"W\" shape of its pupil.",
              "EyeAlthough color-blind, the cuttlefish has two of the most highly developed eyes in the animal kingdom.",
              "It can see well in low light and can also detect polarized light, enhancing its perception of contrast.",
              "While we humans reshape our lenses in order to focus on specific objects, the cuttlefish moves its lenses by reshaping its entire eye.",
              "Also, the cuttlefish's eyes are very large in proportion to its body and may increase image magnification upon the retina, while the distinct \"W\"-shaped pupil helps control the intensity of light entering the eye.",
              "The cuttlefish's undulating fins can move more freely than fish fins because they lack both bony and cartilaginous supports.",
              "FinWhile the cuttlefish uses its mantle cavity for jet propulsion, it relies on its specialized fins for basic mobility and maintaining consistent speeds.",
              "Resembling a short, flouncy skirt, the muscular fin can maneuver the cuttlefish in nearly any direction: backward, forward, even in circles, with such movement being more energetically efficient than jetting.",
              "The movement and positioning of the fins also come into play when smaller males in certain species mimic the opposite sex in order to swim past larger males and gain access to females.",
              "The cuttlefish's pair of orange gills (one appears above) filter oxygen from seawater and deliver it to the bloodstream.",
              "Gills, Hearts, and BloodThe cuttlefish has three hearts, with two pumping blood to its large gills and one circulating the oxygenated blood to the rest of its body.",
              "The blood itself is blue-green in color because it possesses hemocyanin, a copper-containing protein typical in cephalopods\u2014cuttlefish, octopuses, and squids\u2014that transports oxygen throughout their bodies.",
              "(Mammals' red blood uses the iron-rich protein hemoglobin to do the same thing.)",
              "The dark ink sac can be seen clearly in this image of part of the mantle cavity.",
              "Ink SacLike its close relatives, the squid and octopus, the cuttlefish is equipped with an ink sac that can help it make a last-ditch escape from predators that hunt by sight.",
              "The cuttlefish can eject its ink in two ways.",
              "One way creates a smoke screen behind which the animal can escape perceived danger.",
              "In the other, the released ink takes the form of \"pseudomorphs,\" or bubbles of ink surrounded by mucus that are roughly the size of the cuttlefish and can act as decoys.",
              "The ink, which contains dopamine and L-DOPA, a precursor to dopamine, may also temporarily paralyze the sense of smell in predators that hunt by scent.",
              "In this scanning electron microscope image, \"L1\" and \"L2\" mark the lateral lines, while \"A\" indicates the cuttlefish's arms. Lateral LinesAlthough the cuttlefish can't hear, it can detect sound in the form of pressure waves using its lateral epidermal lines.",
              "Seen here via a scanning electron microscope, these lines consist of thousands of hair cells.",
              "The cells seem to be especially sensitive to sounds ranging between 75 and 100 Hz, with 100 Hz being similar in frequency to a typical automobile engine running at maximum speed.",
              "One physiological study showed that in total darkness, healthy cuttlefish could capture about 50 percent of available prey, whereas cuttlefish with compromised epidermal lines could capture only about 30 percent.",
              "The hair cells can also be used in defense, allowing cuttlefish to detect the movement of possible predators.",
              "In this view of the inside of an adult cuttlefish's mantle, the orange gills and dark ink sac are clearly visible.",
              "MantleThe multifunctional mantle cavity is important for cuttlefish locomotion, giving the animal its characteristic jet propulsion ability.",
              "To jet away from a predator, the cuttlefish sucks water into the cavity and then uses its strong mantle muscles to expel the liquid with great force, driving the cuttlefish in the opposite direction.",
              "Water exits through a movable part called the funnel, which controls the angle of the spray.",
              "The mantle cavity also aids in respiration by bringing water to the animal's gills, which in turn filter oxygen into its bloodstream.",
              "Males and females face each other and embrace while mating.",
              "Reproductive OrgansDuring mating, the male uses a modified arm to transfer his genetic material into the female's buccal area.",
              "This is the part of the female's mouth that stores the male's spermatophores (sperm packaged in special containers) until she is ready to use them to fertilize her eggs.",
              "Because the female often accepts more than one mate, the male sometimes sprays water through his mantle funnel into the female's buccal area to wash out other males' spermatophores.",
              "When she is ready to deposit her eggs in safe locations such as under rocks or in discarded shells, the female uses her arms to wipe the stored spermatophores onto each egg.",

              "Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida.",
              "They belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses.",
              "Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.",
              "Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey.",
              "They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.",
              "5 kg (23 lb) in mass.",
              "[3] Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish.",
              "Their predators include dolphins, larger fish (including sharks), seals, seabirds, humans, and other cuttlefish.",
              "The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1\u20132 years.",
              "Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.",
              "[4] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.",
              "[4] The \"cuttle\" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).",
              "[5] The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed.",
              "The word for it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.",
              "The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the end of the Cretaceous period,[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia from the Late Maastrichtian Maastricht Formation of the Netherlands.",
              "[8] Although the Jurassic Trachyteuthis was historically considered possibly related to cuttlefish,[9] later studies considered to be more closely related to octopus and vampire squid.",
              "[10] The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters.",
              "They are mostly shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).",
              "[11] They have an unusual biogeographic pattern;",
              "they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas.",
              "By the time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep for these warm-water species to cross.",
              "[12] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may occur as far south as South Africa.",
              "They are found in sublittoral depths, between the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m (600 ft).",
              "[13] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category of \"least concern\" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
              "This means that while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in some regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic range prevents them from being too threatened.",
              "Ocean acidification, however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.",
              "[14].",
              "Some studies suggest that ocean acidification does not impair normal embryonic development, survival rates or body size.",
              "Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes.",
              "The organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.",
              "[15] Superficial similarities between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution.",
              "The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving W-shape.",
              "[16][17] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[18] they can perceive the polarization of light, which enhances their perception of contrast.",
              "They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their retinas (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and one to look more backward.",
              "The eye changes focus by shifting the position of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the lens as in mammals.",
              "Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind spot exists, because the optic nerve is positioned behind the retina.",
              "They are capable of using stereopsis, enabling them to discern depth/distance because their brain calculates the input from both eyes.",
              "[19][20] The cuttlefish's eyes are thought to be fully developed before birth, and they start observing their surroundings while still in the egg.",
              "In consequence, they may prefer to hunt the prey they saw before hatching.",
              "[21] The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing protein haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood.",
              "The blood is pumped by three separate hearts: two branchial hearts pump blood to the cuttlefish's pair of gills (one heart for each), and the third pumps blood around the rest of the body.",
              "Cuttlefish blood must flow more rapidly than that of most other animals because haemocyanin carries substantially less oxygen than haemoglobin.",
              "Unlike most other mollusks, cephalopods like cuttlefish have a closed circulatory system.",
              "[22] Cuttlefish possess an internal structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and is made of aragonite.",
              "The pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle.",
              "[23] Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture.",
              "The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that distinguish them from their squid relatives.",
              "[24] Like other marine mollusks, cuttlefish have ink stores that are used for chemical deterrence, phagomimicry, sensory distraction, and evasion when attacked.",
              "[25] Its composition results in a dark colored ink, rich in ammonium salts and amino acids that may have a role in phagomimicry defenses.",
              "[25] The ink can be ejected to create a \"smoke screen\" to hide the cuttlefish's escape, or it can be released as a pseudomorph of similar size to the cuttlefish, acting as a decoy while the cuttlefish swims away.",
              "[26] Human use of this substance is wide-ranged.",
              "A common use is in cooking with squid ink to darken and flavor rice and pasta.",
              "It adds a black tint and a sweet flavor to the food.",
              "In addition to food, cuttlefish ink can be used with plastics and staining of materials.",
              "[citation needed] The diverse composition of cuttlefish ink, and its deep complexity of colors, allows for dilution and modification of its color.",
              "Cuttlefish ink can be used to make noniridescent reds, blues, and greens,[27] subsequently used for biomimetic colors and materials.",
              "[citation needed] Cuttlefish have eight arms and two additional elongated tentacles that are used to grasp prey.",
              "The elongated tentacles and mantle cavity serve as defense mechanisms;",
              "when approached by a predator, the cuttlefish can suck water into its mantle cavity and spread its arms in order to appear larger than normal.",
              "[28] Though the mantle cavity is used for jet propulsion, the main parts of the body that are used for basic mobility are the fins, which can maneuver the cuttlefish in all directions.",
              "[29] The suckers of cuttlefish extend most of the length of their arms and along the distal portion of their tentacles.",
              "Like other cephalopods, cuttlefish have \"taste-by-touch\" sensitivity in their suckers, allowing them to discriminate among objects and water currents that they contact.",
              "[30] A common gene between cuttlefish and almost all other cephalopods allows them to produce venom, excreting it through their beak to help kill their prey.",
              "[31] Additionally, the muscles of the flamboyant cuttlefish (Metasepia pfefferi) contain a highly toxic, unidentified compound[4] as lethal as the venom of fellow cephalopod, the blue-ringed octopus.",
              "[32] However, this toxin is only found in the muscle and is not injected in any form classifying it as poisonous, not venomous.",
              "Sleep is a state of immobility characterized by being rapidly reversible, homeostatically controlled, and increasing an organism's arousal threshold.",
              "[33][34] To date one cephalopod species, Octopus vulgaris, has been shown to satisfy these criteria.",
              "[35] Another species, Sepia officinalis, satisfies two of the three criteria but has not yet been tested on the third (arousal threshold).",
              "[34][33] Recent research shows that the sleep-like state in a common species of cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, shows predictable periods[34] of rapid eye movement, arm twitching and rapid chromatophore changes.",
              "[33] The lifespan of a cuttlefish is typically around one to two years, depending on the species.",
              "They hatch from eggs fully developed, around 6 mm (1\u20444 in) long, reaching 25 mm (1 in) around the first two months.",
              "Before death, cuttlefish go through senescence when the cephalopod essentially deteriorates, or rots in place.",
              "Their eyesight begins to fail, which affects their ability to see, move, and hunt efficiently.",
              "Once this process begins, cuttlefish tend to not live long due to predation by other organisms. Cuttlefish start to actively mate at around five months of age.",
              "Male cuttlefish challenge one another for dominance and the best den during mating season.",
              "During this challenge, no direct contact is usually made.",
              "The animals threaten each other until one of them backs down and swims away.",
              "Eventually, the larger male cuttlefish mate with the females by grabbing them with their tentacles, turning the female so that the two animals are face-to-face, then using a specialized tentacle to insert sperm sacs into an opening near the female's mouth.",
              "As males can also use their funnels to flush others' sperm out of the female's pouch, the male then guards the female until she lays the eggs a few hours later.",
              "[36] After laying her cluster of eggs, the female cuttlefish secretes ink on them making them look very similar to grapes.",
              "The egg case is produced through a complex capsule of the female accessory genital glands and the ink bag.",
              "[37] On occasion, a large competitor arrives to threaten the male cuttlefish.",
              "In these instances, the male first attempts to intimidate the other male.",
              "If the competitor does not flee, the male eventually attacks it to force it away.",
              "The cuttlefish that can paralyze the other first, by forcing it near its mouth, wins the fight and the female.",
              "Since typically four or five (and sometimes as many as 10) males are available for every female, this behavior is inevitable.",
              "[38] Cuttlefish are indeterminate growers, so smaller cuttlefish always have a chance of finding a mate the next year when they are bigger.",
              "[39] Additionally, cuttlefish unable to win in a direct confrontation with a guard male have been observed employing several other tactics to acquire a mate.",
              "The most successful of these methods is camouflage;",
              "smaller cuttlefish use their camouflage abilities to disguise themselves as a female cuttlefish.",
              "Changing their body color, and even pretending to be holding an egg sack, disguised males are able to swim past the larger guard male and mate with the female.",
              "[38][40][41] Cephalopods are able to communicate visually using a diverse range of signals.",
              "To produce these signals, cephalopods can vary four types of communication element: chromatic (skin coloration), skin texture (e.",
              "g. rough or smooth), posture, and locomotion.",
              "Changes in body appearance such as these are sometimes called polyphenism.",
              "The common cuttlefish can display 34 chromatic, six textural, eight postural and six locomotor elements, whereas flamboyant cuttlefish use between 42 and 75 chromatic, 14 postural, and seven textural and locomotor elements.",
              "The Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) is thought to have up to 35 distinct signalling states.",
              "[42][43] Cuttlefish are sometimes referred to as the \"chameleons of the sea\" because of their ability to rapidly alter their skin color \u2013 this can occur within one second.",
              "Cuttlefish change color and pattern (including the polarization of the reflected light waves), and the shape of the skin to communicate to other cuttlefish, to camouflage themselves, and as a deimatic display to warn off potential predators.",
              "Under some circumstances, cuttlefish can be trained to change color in response to stimuli, thereby indicating their color changing is not completely innate.",
              "[44] Cuttlefish can also affect the light's polarization, which can be used to signal to other marine animals, many of which can also sense polarization, as well as being able to influence the color of light as it reflects off their skin.",
              "[45] Although cuttlefish (and most other cephalopods) lack color vision, high-resolution polarisation vision may provide an alternative mode of receiving contrast information that is just as defined.",
