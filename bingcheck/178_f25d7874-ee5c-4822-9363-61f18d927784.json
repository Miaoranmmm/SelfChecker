    "response": "Albert Einstein was a remarkable physicist who made many contributions to modern physics, such as the theory of relativity, the photoelectric effect, and the equivalence of mass and energy. However, there are also some captivating and little-known facts about his life and career that may surprise you. Here are some examples:\n\n- Albert Einstein was asked to be the president of Israel in 1952, after the death of the first president Chaim Weizmann. He politely declined the offer, saying he lacked the \"natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people\" [^1^].\n- He was married twice, the second time to his cousin Elsa L\u00f6wenthal. His first wife was Mileva Mari\u0107, a fellow physics student at Z\u00fcrich Polytechnic. They had an illegitimate daughter named Lieserl, whose fate is unknown. Some historians believe she died of scarlet fever in infancy, while others speculate she was given up for adoption [^1^] [^4^].\n- The FBI spied on him for over 22 years, suspecting him of being a communist sympathizer. They compiled a dossier of 1,427 pages on his activities and associations. However, they never found any evidence of his involvement with any subversive groups or activities [^1^] [^3^].\n- His brain was stolen for research purposes after his death in 1955. A pathologist named Thomas Harvey removed Einstein's brain without permission from his family and kept it in a jar for decades. He later sliced it into pieces and sent some samples to other researchers. Some studies claimed to find differences in Einstein's brain structure that could explain his genius, but these findings were disputed by other experts [^1^] [^3^].\n- He became a vegetarian in the last few years of his life, saying that \"nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.\" He also advocated for animal rights and pacifism [^1^] [^5^].\n\nThese facts show that Einstein was not only a brilliant scientist, but also a complex and fascinating human being who had his own struggles, passions, and beliefs. His life and career had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and our place in it.",

              "How Albert Einstein Developed the Theory of General Relativity",
              "In 1907, two years after the publication of his theory of special relativity, Albert Einstein came to a key realization: special relativity could not be applied to gravity or to an object undergoing acceleration.",
              "Imagine someone inside a closed room sitting on Earth.",
              "That person can feel Earth\u2019s gravitational field.",
              "Now put that same room out in space, far from the gravitational influence of any object, and give it an acceleration of 9.",
              "8 meters per second (the same as Earth\u2019s gravitational acceleration).",
              "There would be no way for someone inside the room to distinguish whether what they were feeling was gravity or just uniform acceleration.",
              "Einstein then wondered how light would behave in the accelerating room.",
              "If one were to shine a flashlight across the room, the light would appear to bend downward.",
              "This would happen because the floor of the room would be coming up to the light beam at an ever-faster speed, so the floor would catch up with the light.",
              "Since gravity and acceleration are equivalent, light would bend in a gravitational field.",
              "Finding the correct mathematical expression of these ideas took Einstein several more years.",
              "In 1912, Einstein\u2019s friend, mathematician Marcel Grossman, introduced him to the tensor analysis of Bernhard Riemann, Tullio Levi-Civita, and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, which allowed him to express the laws of physics in the same way in different coordinate systems. Three more years of wrong turns and hard work followed, but in November 1915 the work was complete.",
              "In his four papers, published in November 1915, Einstein laid the foundation of the theory.",
              "In the third in particular he used general relativity to explain the precession of the perihelion of Mercury.",
              "The point at which Mercury has its closest approach to the Sun, its perihelion, moves.",
              "This movement could not be explained by the gravitational influence of the Sun and other planets.",
              "It was such a mystery that in the 19th century a new planet, Vulcan, orbiting close to the Sun, had even been proposed.",
              "No such planet was needed.",
              "Einstein could calculate the shift in Mercury\u2019s perihelion from first principles.",
              "However, the true test of any theory is if it can predict something that has not yet been observed.",
              "General relativity predicted that light would bend in a gravitational field.",
              "In 1919, British expeditions to Africa and South America observed a total solar eclipse to see if the position of stars near the Sun had changed.",

              "Our first President, as you know, taught us to see our destiny in these great perspectives, as you yourself have often exhorted us to do.",

              "Their friendship turned into a relationship after her return.",
              "While her parents accepted the match, Einstein\u2019s parents opposed their relationship.",
              "They did not like the fact that Maric was several years older than him and was from a different religious and cultural background.",
              "While her relationship flourished with Einstein, Maric struggled in her studies.",

              "In 1896, she passed her Matura-Exam, and started studying medicine at the University of Zurich for one semester.",
              "[3] In the fall of 1896, Maric\u0301 switched to the Zurich Polytechnic (later Eidgeno\u0308ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH), having passed the mathematics entrance examination with an average grade of 4.",

              "[10] Maric\u0301's academic career was disrupted in May 1901 on a short holiday in Italy when she became pregnant by Einstein.",

              "At the age of one year, Lieserl suffered from scarlet fever from which she retained permanent damage.",
              "[13] Some sources say Lieserl died soon after in 1903,[14] but others suggest she was put up for adoption in Serbia.",
              "[15] The question whether (and if so, to what extent) Maric\u0301 contributed to Albert Einstein's early work, and to the Annus Mirabilis Papers in particular, is a subject of debate.",
              "Many historians of physics argue that she made no significant scientific contribution,[16] while others suggest that she was a supportive companion in science and may have helped him materially in his research,[17][18] and there is also a possibility of them developing the scientific concepts together when they were still students.",
              "[19] Debate over whether Maric\u0301 was a co-author of some of Einstein's early work, putatively culminating in the 1905 papers, is based on the following evidence: In 1905, three articles appeared in the 'Annalen der Physik', which began three very important branches of 20th century physics.",
              "Those were the theory of Brownian motion, the photon theory of light, and the theory of relativity.",
              "The author of these articles \u2013 an unknown person at that time, was a bureaucrat at the Patent Office in Bern, Einstein-Marity (Marity the maiden name of his wife, which by Swiss custom is added to the husband's family name).",
              "Proponents claim Joffe was erroneously attributing the addition of the name Marity, Maric\u0301's official name, to a \"non-existent\" Swiss custom.",
              "[20] Others have argued that it's unlikely Joffe saw the papers before they were published, and also unlikely he would have remembered the exact name on the papers if he did.",
              "[21] Some of the debate over whether Maric\u0301 collaborated with Einstein is based on their letters: Thus, while some scholars have argued that there is not enough evidence to support the idea that Maric\u0301 helped Einstein to develop his theories,[27][28][29][7] others have argued that their letters suggest a collaboration between them, at least through 1901 before their children were born.",
              "[19] Some of the debate over whether Maric\u0301 collaborated with Einstein is based on their interactions: In 1901, Maric\u0301 was pregnant with Einstein's first child.",
              "She managed to hide the pregnancy and travelled to her home town to give birth in order to avoid the scandal.",
              "Letters to Einstein have documented that their daughter was born in Novi Sad, in January 1902.",
              "No further information is available about what happened to the little girl.",
              "[32][33] In 1903, Maric\u0301 and Einstein married in Bern, Switzerland, where Einstein had found a job at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property.",
              "In 1904, their first son Hans Albert, was born.",
              "The Einsteins lived in Bern until 1909, when Einstein got a teaching position at the University of Zu\u0308rich.",
              "In 1910, their second son Eduard was born.",
              "In 1911, they moved to Prague, where Einstein held a teaching position at Charles University.",
              "A year later, they returned to Zurich, as Einstein had accepted a professorship at his alma mater.",
              "In July 1913, Max Planck and Walther Nernst asked Einstein to come to Berlin, which he agreed to, but the decision caused Maric\u0301 distress.",
              "[34] In August, the Einsteins planned a walking holiday with their sons and Marie Curie and her two daughters.",
              "Maric\u0301 was delayed temporarily due to Eduard being ill, but then joined the party.",
              "In September 1913, the Einsteins visited Maric\u0301's parents near Novi Sad, and on the day they were to leave for Vienna, Maric\u0301 had her sons baptised as Orthodox Christians.",
              "[34] After Vienna, Einstein visited relatives in Germany while Maric\u0301 returned to Zurich.",
              "After Christmas, she traveled to Berlin to stay with Fritz Haber, who helped her look for accommodation for the Einsteins' impending move in April 1914.",
              "The Einsteins both left Zurich for Berlin in late March.",
              "On the way, Einstein visited an uncle in Antwerp and then Ehrenfest and Lorentz in Leiden, while Maric\u0301 took a swimming holiday with the children in Locarno, arriving in Berlin in mid-April.",
              "[34] The marriage had been strained since 1912, in the spring of which Einstein became reacquainted with his first cousin, Elsa.",
              "They began a regular correspondence.",
              "Maric\u0301, who had never wanted to go to Berlin, became increasingly unhappy in the city.",
              "In mid-July 1914,[35] after settling in Berlin, Einstein insisted on harsh terms if she were to remain with him.",
              "Although initially accepting the terms, she reconsidered and on 29 July 1914, the day after World War I started, she left Germany and took the boys back to Zu\u0308rich, a separation that was to become permanent.",
              "Einstein made a legal commitment to send her an annual maintenance of 5600 Reichsmark in quarterly instalments, just under half of his salary,[36][37] a commitment to which he largely adhered.",
              "[38] After the required five years of separation, the couple divorced on 14 February 1919.",
              "[39] They had negotiated a settlement[40] whereby the Nobel Prize money that Einstein anticipated he would soon receive was to be placed in trust for their two boys.",
              "Einstein would receive the prize for his work, and she would receive the money.",
              "Maric\u0301 could draw on the interest, but had no authority over the capital without Einstein's permission.",
              "[41][42] After Einstein married his cousin Elsa in June 1919, he returned to Zurich to talk to Maric\u0301 about the children's future.",
              "During the visit, he took Hans Albert for a sail on Lake Constance and Eduard to Arosa for convalescence.",
              "[citation needed] In 1922, Einstein received news that he had won the Nobel Prize in November.",
              "His divorce agreement promised her his Nobel Prize money.",
              "Under the terms of the agreement, the money was to be held in trust for their two boys, while she was able to draw on the interest.",
              "[43] Based on newly released letters (sealed by Einstein's step-granddaughter, Margot Einstein, until 20 years after her death), Walter Isaacson reported that Maric\u0301 eventually invested the Nobel Prize money in three apartment buildings in Zurich to produce income.",
              "[44][45] Maric\u0301 lived in one, a five-story house at Huttenstrasse 62;",
              "the other two were investments.",
              "In 1930, at around 20, Eduard had a breakdown and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.",

              "She sold the two houses to raise funds for his care and maintenance.",
              "[46] In 1939, Maric\u0301 agreed to transfer ownership of the Huttenstrasse house where she was living to Einstein to prevent its loss, with Maric\u0301 retaining power of attorney.",

              "The past is littered with similar examples.",
              "I found myself drawn into the curious history of these so-called elite brain studies around 15 years ago, when I heard my frustrated calculus students complaining that the Einsteins of the world have a neuroanatomical advantage over mere mortals such as themselves.",
              "I found this idea dismaying\u2014most people's brains are fully equipped to learn college-level calculus\u2014but it prompted me to investigate the scientific literature to see exactly what, if anything, brain research has revealed about the source of mathematical ability in particular and exceptional intellect in general.",
              "In so doing, I found that, despite enthusiastic efforts over the past two centuries to discern the anatomy of talent or genius, scientists are not much closer to finding it now than they were in the 1800s.",
              "The case of Einstein's brain is perhaps the most prominent example of how profound this failure has been.",
              "As of this writing, half a dozen reports on his brain, each highlighting a different anatomical feature as the possible fount of his brilliance, have come forth\u2014all to great media fanfare.",

              "Instead they simply add to the pile of flawed brain studies that have collectively spawned what one critic has ruefully termed a \u201cneuromythology\u201d of genius.",
              "The long and checkered tradition of studying the brains of gifted people began 100 years before Einstein's death with the passing in 1855 of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, the Einstein of his day.",
              "Gauss's University of Go\u0308ttingen colleagues presided over his autopsy and removed his brain.",
              "One of them, an anatomist named Rudolph Wagner, then preserved the whole brain in an alcohol solution and later convinced Gauss's son to allow him to keep it for research.",
              "Wagner obtained the organ to bolster his firmly held belief in Rene\u0301 Descartes's philosophy of dualism: the idea of the mind as something more than the sum of the brain's physical functions.",
              "Are human beings merely sophisticated machines, or are they endowed by God with a soul substance?",
              "This question was the hot-button issue of the era.",
              "Either brain equals mind, or it doesn't.",
              "For Wagner, the very existence of God hung on the answer.",
              "Acquiring the brain of a celebrated genius opened the door to more acquisitions, and within seven years Wagner published two detailed studies of the comparative anatomy of primate brains.",
              "His data set included measurements of 964 brains from people of all walks of life\u2014English poet Lord Byron and French naturalist Georges Cuvier, among them.",
              "Wagner found nothing to dispel his dualistic view of the mind.",
              "Neither brain weight nor surface convolution patterns seemed to correspond with intellectual prowess.",
              "Cuvier's brain was huge, but so was the brain of a manual laborer.",
              "Gauss's brain had an intricate pattern of grooves, or sulci, in the cerebral surface, but so did a washerwoman's.",
              "Thus, the crucial difference between a genius and an average Joe, it seemed, had to lie below the surface or even beyond brain anatomy altogether.",
              "Perhaps it derived, as Wagner hoped, from the divine element, the ghost in the machine.",
              "Scientific materialists of that era, unhappy with Wagner's findings, took the audacious step of founding brain-donation societies in hopes of identifying the physical underpinnings of exceptional talent.",
              "Membership hinged on the promise to bequeath one's brain to one's fellows.",
              "By the end of the 19th century, as science began to usurp the role of religion, bestowing one's brain became a positively fashionable thing to do.",
              "Enthusiasm peaked at the founding of the brain societies, however, and quickly waned in the absence of any substantiated findings.",
              "By the dawn of the 20th century the specimens had piled up, but most went unstudied or were lost to neglect.",
              "Exactly what fueled Harvey's obsession with Einstein's brain is unknown.",
              "He was aware of the historical precedents, of the many collections of celebrated brains.",
              "He may have simply been overcome by curiosity.",
              "But the political atmosphere of the 1950s may have motivated him, too.",
              "Harvey knew that in the 1920s, the search for the anatomy of genius had moved on to the cellular level.",
              "Soviet scientists, having amassed a pantheon of celebrated brains, including those of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, established a secretive research program to map the cortical layers of the brain's hemispheres based on neuronal patterns, a specialty known as cytoarchitectonics.",
              "Outsiders were denied access to the specimens, and the Soviets always seemed poised to announce a great discovery, although they never did.",
              "It was in this atmosphere of cold war competitiveness and paranoia that Harvey decided to appropriate Einstein's brain.",
              "By all accounts, Harvey was an eccentric man but scrupulous.",
              "Once he acquired his hallowed relic, he approached it as methodically as any crime scene investigator.",
              "He photographed the cortical surface from every angle, inserting a scale bar so that measurements could be made from the images.",
              "He then took the specimen to the pathology laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania and entrusted it to a gifted technician, Marta Keller.",
              "Under Harvey's exacting instructions, while using the best practices at the time for neurological tissue preparation, Keller spent the next eight months dissecting portions of the cortex, embedding 240 numbered chunks of it in blocks of a clear plastic material called celloidin and mounting 12 sets of microscope slides with stained tissue slices.",
              "Harvey sent slide sets to several of his peers.",
              "None of them found anything unusual in the slides, but they did find something strange about Harvey's obsessive control over the brain.",

              "Burroughs.",
              "But he never lost interest in the brain, and eventually, three decades after he removed it from Einstein's corpse, Harvey found a neuroscientist to study it.",
              "Or rather she found him.",
              "In 1985 Marian C.",
              "Diamond of the University of California, Berkeley, requested four of Harvey's tissue blocks.",
              "She was interested in studying Einstein's glial cells.",
              "Glial cells act as a support system for neurons.",
              "In Diamond's previous work with mice, she found that exposure to a sensory-enriched environment produces a higher ratio of glial cells to neurons than does a nonstimulating environment.",
              "She suspected that Einstein might have possessed a high ratio of glial cells to neurons in portions of his cortex associated with higher neural functions such as mental imagery, memory and attention.",
              "When Diamond examined the material Harvey sent, she found what she was looking for in one of the four tissue blocks and concluded that the higher proportion of glial cells she observed resulted from Einstein's enhanced use of this tissue.",
              "In the ensuing media frenzy around her study, however, journalists gave the impression that this surfeit was not the product of his deep thinking but the cause of it.",
              "It was not long before scientists themselves began to search for anatomical explanations for Einstein's intellectual prowess.",
              "Studies in the 1990s by Britt Anderson, then at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and psychologist Sandra Witelson of McMaster University in Ontario attributed it to other distinctive aspects of his brain.",
              "Anderson called attention to the high density of cells in his prefrontal cortex.",
              "For her part, Witelson focused on the atypical absence of the so-called parietal operculum, part of a fissure that divides the parietal lobe.",
              "As a result, she claimed, Einstein had an expanded cortical region associated with visuospatial and mathematical abilities.",
              "The ensuing decade saw the publication of many interesting studies on anatomical anomalies in the brains of professional musicians and London taxi drivers but nothing on Einstein.",
              "Then, in 2007, just around the time of Harvey's death, neuro-ophthalmologist Frederick E.",
              "Lepore of what is now the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School discovered a previously unreported cache of Harvey's calibrated photographs of Einstein's brain.",
              "He shared these with Dean Falk, a paleoanthropologist at Florida State University who works primarily on brain evolution.",
              "Falk noticed some odd features in the topography of the brain, including a knob on the cortex known as the Omega sign that had previously been linked to musical talent.",
              "\u201cIt is interesting to contemplate,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthat [Einstein's] extraordinary abilities may, to some degree, have been associated with the unusual gross anatomy of his cerebral cortex.",
              "\u201d In the most recent of the Einstein brain studies, published online in 2013, Falk and Weiwei Men of East China Normal University in Shanghai claimed to find another anatomical explanation for the physicist's prodigious powers of thought: in addition to his unique cortical structure and cytoarchitectonics, Einstein had \u201cenhanced communication routes between at least some parts of his two cerebral hemispheres,\u201d they claimed.",
              "They based their conjecture on measurements of the cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum, the fiber bundle connecting the left and right hemispheres, of Einstein's brain as compared with a control group.",
              "As compelling as these proposed explanations for Einstein's achievements are at first glance, they all suffer from similar methodological defects.",
              "Terence Hines, a psychologist at Pace University, has been their most persistent critic.",
              "Hines observes that, among other scientific sins, the architects of these studies have tended to favor findings that support their preconceptions, downplaying aspects of Einstein's brain that are either within normal limits or even deficient.",
              "Poorly chosen comparative samples have further confused matters.",
              "Anderson, for instance, measured Einstein's brain against only five other brains in her study\u2014hardly enough to capture the range of human variation and generate statistically significant conclusions.",
              "Perhaps most troubling of all is the post hoc fallacy that haunts almost every claim to have pinpointed the anatomical substrate of genius: when you begin with the assumption that geniuses are different from everyone else, the culprit would logically be any anatomical anomaly that you happen to come across.",
              "And if you make enough measurements of anyone's brain, you will find something that sets it apart.",
              "Today, some 60 years after Harvey's fateful decision, Einstein's brain is scattered in several locations.",
              "Harvey returned the bulk of it\u2014170 of the original 240 pieces embedded in celloidin, along with the cerebellum and brain stem\u2014to Princeton Hospital (since replaced with the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro) shortly before his death a decade ago.",
              "That material is now in the care of pathologist Elliot Krauss of the Princeton medical center, who holds Harvey's old job and who guards the material closely.",
              "Harvey's personal collection of some 500 slides, as well as his calibrated photographs, went to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Silver Spring, Md.",

              "Harvey soon lost his job at the Princeton hospital and took the brain to Philadelphia, where it was carved into 240 pieces and preserved in celloidin, a hard and rubbery form of cellulose.",
              "He divvied up the pieces into two jars and stored them in his basement.",
              "Just when you think this story can\u2019t get any weirder, it does.",
              "As Burrell explains (emphasis mine): After [Harvey\u2019s] wife threatened to dispose of the brain, he returned to retrieve it and took it with him to the Midwest.",
              "For a time he worked as a medical supervisor in a biological testing lab in Wichita, Kansas, keeping the brain in a cider box stashed under a beer cooler.",
              "He moved again, to Weston, Missouri, and practiced medicine while trying to study the brain in his spare time, only to lose his medical license in 1988 after failing a three-day competency exam.",
              "He then relocated to Lawrence, Kansas, took an assembly-line job in a plastic-extrusion factory, moved into a second-floor apartment next to a gas station, and befriended a neighbor, the beat poet William Burroughs.",
              "The two men routinely met for drinks on Burroughs\u2019s front porch.",
              "Harvey would tell stories about the brain, about cutting off chunks to send to researchers around the world.",

              "(I know, right?",
              "!)",
              "To fast forward a bit: Come 1985, Harvey and collaborators in California published the first study of Einstein\u2019s brain, claiming that it had an abnormal proportion of two types of cells, neurons and glia.",
              "That study was followed by five others (the most recent published just this month), reporting additional differences in individual cells or in particular structures in Einstein\u2019s brain.",
              "The researchers behind these studies say studying Einstein\u2019s brain could help uncover the neurological underpinnings of intelligence.",
              "But that premise is nonsense and the studies are bunk, at least according toTerence Hines, a professor of psychology at Pace University.",
              "A couple of weeks ago, Hines presented a poster at the Cognitive Neuroscience Society annual meeting outlining all of the ways in which each of the six studies is flawed.",
              "Some highlights: \u2013In the original 1985 report, Harvey and his collaborators found that in Brodmann Area 39\u2014a region where the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes meet\u2014Einstein\u2019s neuron-to-glia ratio was significantly smaller than it was in the same area in 11 control brains.",
              "But the control group was not all that well controlled: the brains came from people age 47 to 80 years old, whereas Einstein died at age 76.",
              "The controls brains were also fresh, whereas Einstein\u2019s had been languishing in basements and beer coolers for three decades.",
              "Perhaps most problematic, counting cells is a subjective business, and the researchers performing the cell counts were not blind to which tissue was Einstein\u2019s and which was not.",
              "\u2013In 1996, Harvey partnered with a scientist from Alabama and counted neurons in Einstein\u2019s Brodmann Area 9\u2014part of the frontal cortex\u2014as well as those of five controls.",
              "There were no differences in the number of neurons or the size of neurons, the study found, but Einstein\u2019s tissue was thinner than controls.",
              "More densely packed neurons, the authors speculated, means that cell-to-cell messages travel shorter differences, which might mean faster processing speed overall.",
              "That\u2019s quite a stretch.",
              "As Hines calls out in his poster, the finding was based on just one square millimeter of Einstein\u2019s brain.",
              "What\u2019s more, the authors admit to not reporting any of the ways in which Einstein\u2019s brain was similar to controls.",
              "\u2013In 1999, Harvey and Canadian collaborators got Einstein\u2019s brain into one of the world\u2019s most prestigious medical journals, The Lancet.",
              "Based on old photographs that had been taken of Einstein\u2019s brain before it was cut up, the researchers claimed that Einstein had an abnormal folding pattern in part of his parietal lobe, a region that has been linked to mathematical ability.",
              "They also reported that his parietal lobes were 15 percent wider, and more symmetrical, than those of control brains.",
              "Once again, though, the researchers were not blinded to which photographs showed Einstein\u2019s brain.",
              "And though the authors were quick to make links between these supposed differences and Einstein\u2019s mathematical prowess, Hines points out that Einstein wasn\u2019t, in fact, a great mathematician.",
              "The underlying problem in all of the studies is that they set out to compare a category made up of one person, an N of 1, with a nebulous category of \u201cnot this person\u201d and an N of more than 1.",
              "With an N of 1, it\u2019s extremely difficult to calculate the statistical variance\u2014the likelihood that, for example, Einstein\u2019s low neuron-to-glia ratio is real and not just a fluke of that particular region and those particular methods.",
              "Even if the statistics were sound, you\u2019d still have the problem of attributing skills and behaviors to anatomy.",
              "There\u2019s no way to know if X thing in Einstein\u2019s brain made Einstein smart/dyslexic/good at math/you name it, or was just an X thing in his brain.",
              "It makes me angry to think of all that was wasted in these investigations.",
              "There was the monetary cost of the studies\u2014money that could have been spent on work that was not doomed from the outset to fail.",
              "There was a personal cost, in that Einstein\u2019s family was essentially strong-armed into agreeing to participate in research that Einstein explicitly did not want to participate in.",
              "And there was a public cost, too.",
              "In popular-press accounts of these studies over the years, the public was misled about the findings and their supposed scientific value.",
              "I\u2019ve made this error, too, by the way.",
              "In 2012 I wrote an uncritical, cringe-worthy report on preliminary data from a neuroscience conference comparing brain images of Temple Grandin, one of the most famous people with autism, with those of three controls.",

              "According to Carolyn Abraham, author of Possessing Genius: The Bizarre Odyssey of Einstein\u2019s Brain, Harvey \u201chad some big professional hopes pinned on that brain\u201d and likely figured that the organ might further his career in medicine.",

              "Harvey was not a neurologist, but he promised to marshal the country's greatest specialists to study the brain, and to publish their findings soon.",
              "Years passed, however, and no scientific paper emerged.",
              "After a while, Einstein's brain was forgotten.",
              "Then, in 1978 a young reporter, Steven Levy, was dispatched by his editor to find the illustrious organ.",
              "The brain was nowhere to be seen at Princeton Medical Center, as Princeton Hospital was then called, and neither was Thomas Harvey.",
              "Levy eventually tracked him down to Wichita, Kansas.",
              "\"I told him, 'I'm writing a story about Einstein's brain.'",
              "The first thing he said was: 'I really can't help you with that,'\" Levy remembers.",
              "\"He wasn't eager to talk.\"",
              "In the end, though, Harvey agreed to meet the reporter in his office in the small medical lab where he was working and it quickly became apparent, to Levy's surprise, that Harvey still aspired to publish a scientific report.",
              "\"He was a somewhat introverted guy, a polite guy,\" Levy recalls.",
              "\"But as the conversation went on, he had a pride that he was doing this study, but he didn't really have good answers as to why, after almost 25 years, nothing had been published.\"",
              "When Levy pressed Harvey to see some pictures of the brain, a strange look came over the doctor's face.",
              "Grinning sheepishly, he stood up, walked behind Levy to the corner of the room, and removed a beer cooler from a stack of cardboard boxes.",
              "The bottom box was labelled Costa Cider.",
              "\"He reaches in, pulls out these big mason jars,\" says Levy.",
              "\"And there was Einstein's brain.",
              "It was amazing.\"",
              "In Levy's article, published in the New Jersey Monthly, he described the contents of one of the jars.",
              "\"A conch shell-shaped mass of wrinkly material the colour of clay after firing.",
              "A fist-sized chunk of greyish, lined substance, the apparent consistency of sponge.",
              "And in a separate pouch, a mass of pinkish-white strings resembling bloated dental floss.\"",
              "A second, larger jar contained \"dozens of rectangular translucent blocks, the size of Goldenberg's Peanut Chews\".",
              "The missing 23 years have now been filled in.",
              "Back in 1955, armed with Hans Albert Einstein's permission to conduct an investigation, Harvey had measured and photographed the brain and even commissioned a painting of it from an artist who had done portraits of his children.",
              "In those early days, he was not acting alone, but had the support of Einstein's executor, Otto Nathan, and the physicist's friend, the neuropathologist Harry Zimmerman.",
              "Harvey had overseen the division of the brain into 240 blocks, and created 12 sets of 200 slides containing tissue samples indexed to the blocks.",
              "These were delivered, as promised, to the great and the good of 1950s neuropathology.",
              "But Harvey heard very little back from these august men.",
              "Those who did reply found it to be no different from normal, non-genius brains.",
              "This mirrored the result Harvey had received when he first weighed the brain, and found it to be - at 1,230g - towards the low end of the normal range for men of Einstein's age.",
              "All the time, as he energetically ferried small samples of Einstein's brain across the US, he doggedly hung on to the bulk of it.",
              "Among those who tried to take it from him was the US Army.",
              "\"They felt that having it would put them on a par with the Russians, who were collecting their own brains at that time,\" says Abraham.",
              "\"People were collecting brains - it was a thing.\"",
              "But taking possession the brain set in motion a painful chain of events for Harvey.",
              "\"This was supposed to have been his great good luck charm but in fact it was much more like a relic cursed,\" says Abraham.",

              "That explains why Harvey was in Wichita when Steven Levy caught up with him.",
              "When the article appeared in summer 1978, Harvey was suddenly the centre of much attention.",
              "The journal Science interviewed him and reporters camped out on his lawn.",
              "He was approached for samples, by, among others, the neuro-anatomist Marian Diamond at the University of California, Berkeley.",
              "With the package that Harvey sent to Diamond by post, of four sugar cube-sized pieces of brain in a jar previously used for Kraft Miracle Whip mayonnaise, the era of Einstein brain studies finally took off.",
              "What have these studies told us about Einstein's brain and the nature of intelligence?",
              "Diamond's 1985 paper in Experimental Neurology identified one of the four brain samples as having more so-called glial cells for every neuron, compared to a control group of brains.",
              "Glial cells - which get their name from the Greek for \"glue\" - fix neurons into place and keep them supplied with oxygen and nutrients.",
              "In previous research on rats, Diamond had shown that a stimulating environment can lead to an increase in glial cell count.",
              "Perhaps the low ratio of neurons to glial cells in Einstein's brain sample reflected a life devoted to the biggest and most stimulating scientific puzzles?",
              "More studies followed.",
              "In 1996, Britt Anderson at the University of Alabama at Birmingham published a study on Einstein's prefrontal cortex.",
              "He found that the number of neurons was equivalent to brains in a control group, but they were more tightly packed, allowing, perhaps, for faster processing of information.",
              "In a 1999 Lancet paper, Sandra Witelson from McMaster University in Canada studied Harvey's original photographs of Einstein's brain.",
              "She said that Einstein's inferior parietal lobule - the part of the brain responsible for spatial cognition and mathematical thought - was wider than normal, and seemed better integrated.",
              "Perhaps, Witelson speculated, the shape of the brain may relate to Einstein's own descriptions of his thinking in which \"words do not seem to play any role\", but there is an \"associative play\" of \"more or less clear images\"?",
              "In 2012, the eminent anthropologist Dean Falk worked with a set of previously unseen photographs of Einstein's brain that Harvey had taken with an Exacta camera.",
              "She did a complete audit of the brain, naming every convolution and crevice, and found a number of unusual features.",
              "Perhaps the most striking is that Einstein had an extra ridge on his mid-frontal lobe, the part used for making plans and working memory.",
              "Most people have three ridges but Einstein had four.",
              "She also found Einstein's parietal lobes were dramatically asymmetric, and he had a knob on his right motor strip.",
              "This latter feature is called the \"sign of omega\" and it is thought to be correlated to musicians who use their left hands.",
              "Einstein played the violin.",
              "Falk was also named on a 2013 study that looked at Einstein's unusual corpus callosum, the bundle of fibres connecting the left and right hemispheres of the brain.",
              "The researchers found Einstein's was thicker than in control groups, suggesting enhanced co-operation between brain hemispheres.",
              "The question arises: Are these features that Einstein developed throughout a life devoted to higher thought, or was he born with them?",
              "People are born with the basic pattern of convolutions in their brains, but the extent to which these are reshaped by experience is unknown.",
              "The sign of omega may have developed as Einstein practised the violin as a boy, Falk says, but she thinks it is more difficult to assess the contribution of life's experiences to other parts of the brain.",
              "With each of these papers, starting with Marian Diamond in 1985, the press splashed the story with headlines suggesting that scientists had discovered the special neural wiring responsible for E=mcA\u03022.",
              "The truth is that the links with Einstein's genius have never been anything more than speculative.",
              "\"You can't take just one brain of someone who is different from everyone else - and we pretty much all are - and say, 'Ah-ha!",
              "I have found the thing that makes T Hines a stamp collector!\"",

              "And it's bull.\"",
              "Hines has accused the scientists involved in the Einstein brain studies of being caught up in what he calls the \"neuromythology\" of Einstein's brain.",
              "The first victim of this tendency was arguably Harvey himself.",
              "He told Steven Levy in 1978 that all the research so far conducted on the brain \"showed it to be within normal limits for a man his age\".",
              "But rather than publishing these results, Harvey waited for exceptional differences to turn up, differences worthy of an exceptional man.",
              "This \"selection bias\" was also evident in the first of the studies to find a possibly significant difference - Marian Diamond's.",
              "She subjected the four brain samples to seven different tests, Hines says, but Einstein's brain only came back as unusual in one of the measures - the glial cells - and only in one of the samples.",
              "In what has become a bitter spat about the body of a famously mild-mannered man, Falk and her co-writers insist that Einstein's brain is exceptional.",
              "There is a natural variation in our brain anatomy, true, but Einstein possessed unusual features in every cerebral lobe, some very unusual.",
              "But they are willing to accept that it's impossible to map these anatomical differences on to Einstein's genius with any certainty.",

              "Hines makes the point that to correlate an unusual feature of the brain to a characteristic you need lots of brains with those unusual features.",
              "The easiest way to do it, he says, would be to put a lot of geniuses through the flashiest neural imaging scanner you can afford - perhaps by taking the scanner to the Large Hadron Collider and get the scientists there to form a queue.",
              "\"They may not find anything, but that would be far more productive than slicing and dicing one or two brains of geniuses,\" he says.",

              "Harvey soon lost his job at the Princeton hospital and took the brain to Philadelphia, where it was carved into 240 pieces and preserved in celloidin, a hard and rubbery form of cellulose.",

              "To fast forward a bit: Come 1985, Harvey and collaborators in California published the first study of Einstein\u2019s brain, claiming that it had an abnormal proportion of two types of cells, neurons and glia.",
              "That study was followed by five others (the most recent published just this month), reporting additional differences in individual cells or in particular structures in Einstein\u2019s brain.",

              "Some highlights: \u2013In the original 1985 report, Harvey and his collaborators found that in Brodmann Area 39\u2014a region where the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes meet\u2014Einstein\u2019s neuron-to-glia ratio was significantly smaller than it was in the same area in 11 control brains.",

              "Based on old photographs that had been taken of Einstein\u2019s brain before it was cut up, the researchers claimed that Einstein had an abnormal folding pattern in part of his parietal lobe, a region that has been linked to mathematical ability.",
              "They also reported that his parietal lobes were 15 percent wider, and more symmetrical, than those of control brains.",
