              "The blood vessels in shrimp hearts are open, while those in human hearts are closed.",
              "This difference is due to the fact that shrimp hearts need to pump blood to different parts of the body at different times, while human hearts only need to pump blood to the lungs.",
              "Overall, shrimp hearts and human hearts are quite different.",
              "While they share some similarities, such as their general function of pumping blood, they differ in many ways, including size, structure, and the way in which they pump blood.",
              "Shrimp hearts are a type of invertebrate that uses a series of muscular contractions to pump blood throughout its body.",
              "The heart is located in the shrimp's abdomen, and is made up of two chambers that are connected by a muscular septum.",
              "The blood enters the heart through the ostium, and is then pumped into the shrimp's aorta.",
              "The aorta is a large blood vessel that runs along the length of the shrimp's body and supplies blood to all of its organs.",
              "The ostium is located at the bottom of the shrimp's heart, and is surrounded by a muscular ring called the contraction ring.",
              "When the contraction ring contracts, it closes the ostium and forces the blood to flow into the heart.",
              "The blood then flows through the septum and into the upper chamber of the heart.",
              "From there, it is pumped into the aorta and circulated throughout the body.",
              "The shrimp's heart is able to pump blood in both directions, depending on the needs of the shrimp.",
              "When the shrimp is swimming, the heart pumps blood towards the gills so that they can receive oxygen.",
              "When the shrimp is resting, the heart pumps blood towards the Digestive system so that it can be processed.",
              "The shrimp heart is a simple, yet amazing, organ that is vital to the shrimp's survival.",
              "Without it, the shrimp would not be able to circulate blood and would quickly die.",
              "The shrimp heart is a small, rod-shaped organ that is found in the chest cavity of shrimp.",

              "Additionally, sleep is crucial for the development of a snail\u2019s shell.",
              "The shell serves as a protective covering for the snail, housing its vital organs and providing support.",
              "During sleep, snails\u2019 shells undergo a process of growth and strengthening.",
              "This ensures that the shell can adequately protect the snail as it continues to grow and explore its surroundings.",
              "Snails also rely on sleep for their reproductive processes.",
              "During sleep, snails undergo hormonal changes that are necessary for successful reproduction.",

              "In this section, we will explore the sleep habits of snails in different habitats, focusing on terrestrial and aquatic snail sleep patterns.",
              "Terrestrial snails, those that inhabit land-based environments, have adapted their sleep patterns to navigate the challenges posed by their surroundings.",
              "These snails, often found in gardens or forests, display distinct sleep behaviors that allow them to thrive in their terrestrial homes.",
              "One key aspect of sleep for terrestrial snails is their ability to maintain moisture levels.",
              "These snails are highly sensitive to dehydration, and their sleep patterns reflect this.",
              "During the day, when the sun is at its peak and the risk of drying out is high, terrestrial snails retreat into their shells and enter a state of dormancy.",
              "This dormancy, similar to a form of hibernation, allows them to conserve moisture and protect themselves from harsh environmental conditions.",
              "At night, when the temperatures drop and the risk of dehydration decreases, terrestrial snails become more active.",
              "They venture out of their shells and engage in various activities such as foraging for food or seeking potential mates.",
              "These nocturnal habits enable them to make the most of the cooler, more favorable conditions during the nighttime hours.",
              "Interestingly, terrestrial snails also exhibit a bursty sleep pattern.",
              "Burstiness refers to the tendency of sleep to occur in short, intermittent bursts rather than in a continuous, uninterrupted state.",
              "This bursty sleep pattern allows snails to remain vigilant and respond quickly to potential threats or opportunities in their surroundings.",
              "By alternating between periods of sleep and wakefulness, terrestrial snails can balance the need for rest and recovery with the need to stay alert and responsive.",
              "In summary, terrestrial snails have adapted their sleep patterns to cope with the challenges of their land-based habitats.",
              "Their ability to enter a state of dormancy during the day and engage in bursty sleep at night enables them to conserve moisture, remain vigilant, and thrive in their terrestrial homes.",
              "While terrestrial snails have their unique sleep habits, their aquatic counterparts exhibit sleep patterns tailored to their watery environments.",
              "Aquatic snails, found in freshwater bodies or marine habitats, have evolved to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by their aquatic homes.",
              "Aquatic snails, unlike their terrestrial counterparts, do not have to worry about dehydration.",
              "The water surrounding them provides a constant source of moisture, eliminating the need for the same level of dormancy observed in terrestrial snails.",
              "Instead, aquatic snails can engage in more continuous sleep patterns without the need for frequent interruptions.",
              "During the day, when the sunlight penetrates the water, aquatic snails often seek shelter in the depths or beneath rocks and vegetation.",
              "In these secluded spots, they enter a state of rest, conserving energy and avoiding potential predators.",
              "This diurnal sleep behavior allows them to rest and recover while minimizing their exposure to the risks of their aquatic environment.",
              "At night, when darkness engulfs the water, aquatic snails emerge from their hiding places and become more active.",
              "They engage in various activities such as feeding, mating, and exploring their surroundings.",
              "This nocturnal sleep behavior enables them to take advantage of the cover of darkness, when potential predators may be less active, and food sources may be more abundant.",
              "Similar to terrestrial snails, aquatic snails also exhibit bursty sleep patterns to maintain alertness and responsiveness.",
              "However, their bursts of sleep may be longer and less frequent compared to their terrestrial counterparts.",

              "(Even so, he acknowledged to The Independent, \"it is extremely unlikely that koala prints would be found at the scene of a crime.",
              "\u201d) While Henneberg\u2019s discovery didn\u2019t help crack any koala cold cases, it did add fuel to a decades-long debate about what fingerprints are for and how humans evolved to possess them.",

              "That\u2019s why everyone has slightly different fingerprints, even identical twins.",
              "But what would make fingerprints useful from an evolutionary standpoint?",
              "Before Henneberg\u2019s koala discovery, conventional wisdom held that fingerprints increase friction, helping humans grasp items better.",
              "However, a handful of more recent studies indicate it\u2019s more complicated than that.",
              "In 2009, biologist Roland Ennos published a study suggesting that when in contact with an object, the skin on our fingertips behaves like rubber.",
              "That means friction between our skin and a surface increases in proportion to the total area in contact.",
              "And because the skin is ridged with loops, whorls, and arches, it actually makes less contact with that surface than if it were smooth, meaning that fingerprints may actually decrease friction.",
              "But more recently, a study building on Ennos\u2019 conclusions suggested that, while fingerprints may not build friction on their own, they may help maintain grip by working in conjunction with sweat glands.",
              "The researchers found that when in contact with hard, impermeable surfaces, our fingers release moisture.",
              "The moisture builds friction by softening the skin on our fingertips, with help from the prints\u2019 tiny grooves, which direct the liquid in a way that allows maximum evaporation.",
              "(That\u2019s important because if the sweat pools too much, it could lead to slippage.)",
              "The newly pliant skin also allows for another built-in protection, since pressing against the surface eventually blocks off the pores manufacturing the sweat, allowing evaporation to catch up and helping maintain the all-important friction.",
              "\"This dual-mechanism for managing moisture has provided primates with an evolutionary advantage in dry and wet conditions\u2013giving them manipulative and locomotive abilities not available to other animals,\" coauthor Mike Adams said in a press release at the time.",
              "And fingerprints may also provide crucial sensitivity in our fingertips.",
              "Physicists at E\u0301cole Normale Supe\u0301rieure in Paris found that fingerprint ridges may amplify the vibrations made by rubbing a fingertip across a rough surface, delivering those vibrations to nerve endings in our fingers.",

              "But our last common ancestor with koalas was, by some calculations, more than 100 million years ago, when marsupials split off from the rest of mammals.",
              "So how did we come to share this particular trait?",
              "The answer is what\u2019s called \u201cconvergent evolution,\u201d when unrelated organisms evolve identical characteristics in response to similar evolutionary pressures.",

              "Bat and bird wings evolved separately.",
              "As Live Science points out, sharks and dolphins come from lineages that diverged hundreds of millions of years ago, but both evolved smooth skin and sharp fins to help them chase down prey.",
              "And since marsupials branched off so long ago, there\u2019s even a parallel track of them in Australia that have convergent-evolved with our placental mammal cousins.",
              "Marsupial moles Down Under, for example, are unrelated to moles in other parts of the world.",
              "Yet both are blind and boast feet very similarly adapted for a life digging underground.",

              "He felt that koala fingerprints must have originated as an adaptation to this task, and a relatively recent one, since neither wombats nor kangaroos (both koala cousins) have them.",

              "The findings are letting scientists in on hidden details of how these speedy armaments work.",
              "Mantis shrimp are equipped with special pairs of arms that can explode with bulletlike accelerations to strike at speeds of up to roughly 110 kilometers per hour.",
              "Previously, scientists deduced these weapons act much like crossbows.",

              "But researchers didn\u2019t know at what age mantis shrimp first begin launching these spring-loaded attacks.",
              "Computer simulations predicted that the armaments might be capable of greater accelerations the smaller they got, suggesting young mantis shrimp could actually have faster weapons than adults, says Jacob Harrison, a marine biologist at Duke University.",
              "To solve this mystery, Harrison and his colleagues collected a host of microscopic creatures off boat docks in Oahu, Hawaii, sifting out larvae of Philippine mantis shrimp (Gonodactylaceus falcatus) roughly the size of rice grains.",
              "They then glued the larvae onto toothpicks to record their punches in high-speed video.",
              "The researchers also captured a clutch of eggs from the species and raised the hatchlings for 28 days to see how the anatomy of their weaponry developed over time.",
              "As soon as nine days after hatching, the larvae began striking rapidly.",

              "More importantly, it\u2019s up to 10 times the swimming speeds of crustaceans and fish roughly as big as the larvae, and more than 150 times those of young brine shrimp that the researchers fed them.",
              "These weapons emerged about when the mantis shrimp larvae first begin feeding on live prey, after exhausting the yolk sacs they were born with, Harrison says.",

              "Water feels more viscous for tiny creatures than it does for larger ones, so moving through it can prove challenging for microscopic larvae.",
              "However, their powerful appendages may overcome this drag to capture prey, he notes.",

              "For instance, during punches, the larvae swiveled their arms at speeds roughly a third to half those of adult peacock mantis shrimp.",
              "These findings suggest there may be some constraints on these weapons at these microscopic sizes that further research can uncover, Harrison says.",

              "This intriguing behavior has intrigued researchers and animal behaviorists for years.",
              "One possible explanation for dolphins\u2019 interaction with pufferfish is their curiosity and the desire for stimulation.",
              "Pufferfish have unique features, such as their ability to inflate themselves into a spiky ball when threatened.",
              "This novelty may attract dolphins and spark their interest, leading them to interact with these fascinating creatures.",
              "Another possible reason for dolphins playing with pufferfish is their use as a form of playtime and social interaction.",
              "Dolphins are highly social animals, and they engage in various playful activities to bond with one another.",
              "Playing with pufferfish could serve as a recreational activity, enabling dolphins to strengthen social bonds within their pod.",
              "The playful interaction may involve tossing or pushing the pufferfish gently, providing both physical and mental stimulation for the dolphins.",
              "Additionally, some researchers speculate that dolphins\u2019 interaction with pufferfish may have a practical purpose.",
              "Pufferfish are known to produce a toxin called tetrodotoxin, which can be lethal to most predators.",
              "However, dolphins have been observed carefully handling pufferfish without triggering their defensive response.",
              "It is possible that dolphins have learned to use their skills and intelligence to manipulate the pufferfish in a way that avoids the release of toxins.",
              "By practicing these interactions, dolphins may be acquiring valuable knowledge and honing their hunting techniques Pufferfish contain a potent neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin, which is highly toxic to most animals, including dolphins.",
              "Ingesting or coming into contact with tetrodotoxin can be lethal.",
              "Dolphins are aware of the dangers associated with pufferfish and have been observed engaging with them cautiously, often avoiding direct ingestion or contact with the toxin.",
              "While dolphins may interact with pufferfish, it is not for the purpose of getting high but rather for play, exploration, or potentially learning about their defensive mechanisms. Pufferfish, also known as fugu, can be eaten, but it comes with considerable risks.",
              "Certain species of pufferfish contain the aforementioned neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin, which can be deadly if consumed in sufficient quantities.",
              "However, in countries like Japan, where pufferfish is considered a delicacy, specially trained and licensed chefs carefully prepare it, removing the toxic organs and ensuring that only safe parts are served.",
              "Despite these precautions, consuming pufferfish still carries a level of risk, and it is important to entrust its preparation to skilled professionals who have expertise in handling and preparing this potentially dangerous delicacy.",
              "In conclusion, the playful interaction between dolphins and pufferfish may stem from a combination of curiosity, social bonding, and potential learning opportunities.",
              "While the exact reasons behind this behavior may still be a subject of ongoing research, it is clear that dolphins find the presence of pufferfish intriguing and engaging.",
              "The playful interactions serve as a testament to the remarkable intelligence and adaptability of these marine mammals.",

              "But do they really play with them?",
              "Read below to know!",
              "A new study suggests that it\u2019s actually possible that dolphins could be playing with these creatures by carrying them around in their mouths because they enjoy the sensation of their bodies slowly inflating as a result of their defense mechanism.",
              "Dolphins are known to be smart animals, and now, researchers have evidence to suggest that dolphins might play with puffer fish to protect themselves from the sharp spines of the fish.",
              "In a study published in the journal Marine Mammal Science, scientists from Japan report that dolphins carry around porcupine fishes (also known as balloonfishes) in their mouths and blow the fish up like balloons before throwing them back into the water to protect themselves against sharp spines on the fishes\u2019 bodies.",

              "Read on to learn more about this fascinating topic.",
              "Dolphins usually intentionally play with puffer fish in order to get high off the neurotoxin these marine animals naturally produce.",
              "Dolphins are not the only creatures that use these neurotoxins \u2013 many other mammals, and reptiles have been observed consuming hallucinogenic plants or prey that naturally produce mind-altering chemicals in order to improve their mood or make them more sociable.",
              "Image Credits: SvenBachstroem by pixabay free Images In other words, dolphins do play with puffer fish, in fact they love playing with puffer fish not only because they are small and easy to play with but also because they use these small puffer fish to get high.",
              "While watching dolphins playing in the ocean, you might be surprised to see them carrying around puffer fish in their mouths.",
              "This might make you wonder when a dolphin plays with a puffer fish.",

              "Dolphins get the same sensation from these puffer fish as people do from smoking marijuana \u2014 they just want to get high!",
              "These animals are intelligent and curious, and many scientists believe that they\u2019re just trying to recreate the sensation of getting high naturally.",

              "The dolphin, being so much larger than the puffer fish, uses its body and fins to herd the puffer fish into little clusters where they both play by blowing bubble rings and swimming through them.",
              "The dolphin also has fun by creating waves that carry the little fish into the air and then gently catches them as they fall back down.",
              "The dolphin even lets the puffer fish ride on its nose!",
              "Along with that, did you know that Dolphins have been observed playing with puffer fish by putting them on their noses and watching them inflate to many times their normal size?",
              "Did you know that they do this to get the fish to stick there so they can keep it as a pet?",
              "The dolphin will place the fish on its snout and swim around, watching the fish and staying entertained.",
              "Thus, dolphins have unique ways of playing with little puffer fish.",
              "The intelligent, playful dolphin has long been considered to be one of the most advanced marine animals and now, new evidence suggests that dolphins may engage in playful behaviors with fish, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen before in non-human animals.",
              "But is that true?",
              "Let\u2019s dive into it Dolphins have been seen at times trying to play with puffer fish, which are also called blowfish or globefish, off the coast of Japan.",
              "They play with them to have fun under the water and to get high Dolphins are famous for their intelligence and playfulness, and it turns out that some of the most common marine mammals aren\u2019t just good at playing, they can also understand puffer fish signals!",
              "To conclude, the fact that the dolphins are extremely smart and they find out that puffer fish are the thing which gives them the feeling of high.",

              "For 300 years, the animals lived in an environment dominated by sugar cane plantations.",
              "And when the sugar cane was burned, or occasionally fermented before harvest, it became a treat for the monkeys.",
              "As they became accustomed to the ethanol in the fermented cane juice, the monkeys may have developed both a taste and tolerance for alcohol.",
              "Local stories are told of catching wild monkeys by supplying them with a mixture of rum and molasses in hollowed out coconut shells.",

              "In 1995, marine scientist Lisa Steiner provided perhaps the first description of a peculiar behaviour she witnessed near the Azores.",
              "One evening, she motored by an aggregation of some 50-60 dolphins, each in its own group of four-to-seven individuals.",
              "The dolphins appeared to be feeding, but they were acting strange, not displaying the typical high-energy behaviour.",
              "A few were lazily feeding, but many were just slowly swimming about.",

              "The pufferfish produces a toxin that is numbing if ingested in small amounts by dolphins, but also highly dangerous (Thinkstock) It isn't necessarily clear just what the dolphins were doing with the puffer fish, but their uncharacteristically lackadaisical behaviour implies to some that they were experiencing some mild intoxication from puffer fish venom, tetrodotoxin.",
              "A BBC documentary called Dolphins: Spy in the Pod that aired last year made the same argument.",
              "It's a controversial idea, because tetrodotoxin is so dangerous that a small dose can kill.",

              "She argues that curious, big-brained mammals, dolphins might explore puffer fish, and may accidentally expose themselves to a bit of the toxin, but is extremely sceptical of the notion that dolphins are dosing themselves intentionally, with such precision to achieve a bit of numbness without accidentally overdosing.",
              "In addition, tetrodotoxin isn't actually psychoactive.",

              "Physiologists Steve Morris, David Humphreys, and Dan Reynolds of the University of Bristol first heard the rumours of the drunk elephants while in South Africa for a scientific conference, so they set about determining whether the legends might reflect some truth.",
              "A search of the scientific literature supported the notion that elephants could at least become drunk.",
              "A 1984 study showed that they were happy to drink up a 7% alcohol solution, and several drank enough to alter their behaviour.",
              "While they didn't \"act drunk\", in human terms, they decreased the time spent feeding, drinking, bathing, and exploring, and became more lethargic.",
              "Several displayed behaviours that indicated they were uncomfortable, or perhaps slightly ill.",
              "Drunk trunk?",
              "But just because elephants can become intoxicated doesn't mean that they do it in the wild routinely enough to inspire all the marula tree legends.",
              "A 3,000kg (6,600lb) elephant would have to drink between 10 and 27 litres of a 7% alcohol solution in a relatively short amount of time to experience any overt behavioural changes.",
              "Even if marula fruit contained 3% ethanol (a generous estimate) an elephant eating only marula fruits at a normal pace would barely consume half the alcohol necessary in a single day to become drunk.",
              "If it wanted to get drunk, given the constraints of its anatomy and physiology, an elephant would have to eat marula fruit at 400% its normal feeding rate while also eschewing all additional water intake.",
              "\"On our analysis,\" the researchers conclude, \"this seems extremely unlikely.\"",
              "An elephant feeding from the alcoholic marula tree (Thinkstock) Still, something must explain the unusual behaviour of elephants around marula trees.",
              "Morris, Humphreys, and Reynolds offer two possible explanations.",
              "First, their unusually aggressive behaviour may simply reflect the fruit's status as a highly prized food item.",
              "A second, more intriguing hypothesis, is that there's another intoxicant that they're consuming.",
              "In addition to the fruits, elephants also sometimes eat the tree\u2019s bark.",
              "This often contains beetle pupae, which contain a substance that local Africans historically used to poison their arrow tips.",
              "If they were ingesting the beetle toxin, perhaps that could explain the unusual antics of the pachyderms. It's a seductive idea, isn't it?",
              "That other animals are as interested in getting as drunk and high as we are?",
              "While there are a few legitimate accounts of wild animals intentionally seeking out mind-altering substances, most such tales are based on legend and hearsay, and others simply have insufficient evidence to understand.",
              "Morris, Humphreys, and Reynolds point out that the majority of drunken animal stories are \"anecdotal, mired in folklore and myth\".",
              "And in a few cases, it\u2019s possible that people are mistakenly attributing certain movements or temperaments to how humans act when inebriated.",

              "The species is endemic to semiarid regions of central east Australia.",
              "[7] Aboriginal Australians living in those regions named the snake dandarabilla.",
              "[8][9] It was formally described by Frederick McCoy in 1879 and then by William John Macleay in 1882, but for the next 90 years, it was a mystery to the scientific community;",
              "no further specimens were found, and virtually nothing was added to the knowledge of this species until its rediscovery in 1972.",
              "[8][10] Based on the median lethal dose value in mice, the venom of the inland taipan is by far the most toxic of any snake \u2013 much more so than even that of sea snakes[11][12][13] \u2013 and it has the most toxic venom of any reptile when tested on human heart cell culture.",
              "[14][15][16] The inland taipan is a specialist hunter of mammals, so its venom is specially adapted to kill warm-blooded species.",
              "[17] One bite possesses enough lethality to kill more than an estimated 100 fully grown humans.",
              "[18] It is an extremely fast and agile snake that can strike instantly with extreme accuracy,[19] often striking multiple times in the same attack,[20] and it envenomates in almost every case.",
              "[21] Although the most venomous and a capable striker, in contrast to the coastal taipan, which many experts cite as an extremely dangerous snake due to its behaviour when it encounters humans,[22][23][24] the inland taipan is usually a quite shy and reclusive snake, with a placid disposition,[25] and prefers to escape from trouble.",
              "[26] However, it will defend itself and strike if provoked,[27] mishandled,[28] or prevented from escaping.",
              "[29] Because it lives in such remote locations, the inland taipan seldom comes in contact with people;",
              "[30] therefore it is not considered the deadliest snake in the world overall, especially in terms of disposition and human deaths per year.",
              "[31] The word \"fierce\" from its alternative name describes its venom, not its temperament.",
              "[32] To the Aboriginal people from the place now called Goyder Lagoon in north-east South Australia, the inland taipan was called dandarabilla.",
              "[8][9] The inland taipan was first described scientifically in 1879.",
              "Two specimens[10] of the fierce snake were discovered at the junction of the Murray and Darling Rivers in northwestern Victoria and described by Frederick McCoy, who called the species Diemenia microlepidota, or small-scaled brown snake.",
              "In 1882, a third specimen was found near Bourke, New South Wales, and William John Macleay described the same snake under the name Diemenia ferox (thinking it was a different species[33]).",
              "[5][7] No more specimens were collected until 1972.",

              "ferox.",
              "[5] In 1956, relying only on published descriptions and notes,[33] James Roy Kinghorn regarded ferox as a synonym for microlepidotus and proposed the genus Parademansia.",
              "In 1963, Eric Worrell considered Parademansia microlepidotus and Oxyuranus scutellatus (coastal taipan, named simply \"taipan\" in those days) to be the same species.",
              "[5] In September 1972, after receiving an unclassified snake head sample from a grazier from one of the Channel Country stations west of Windorah of the far southwest Queensland, herpetologists Jeanette Covacevich (then working for the Queensland Museum) and Charles Tanner travelled to the site and found 13 living specimens, and rediscovered the lost snake Parademansia microlepidotus.",
              "[10] In 1976, Covacevich and Wombey argued that Parademansia microlepidotus belongs to a distinct genus, and this was also the opinion of Harold Cogger.",
              "[5] Covacevich, McDowell, Tanner & Mengden (1981) successfully argued, by comparing anatomical features, chromosomes, and behaviours of the two species then known as Oxyuranus scutellatus (taipan) and Parademansia microlepidota, that they belonged in a single genus.",
              "Oxyuranus (1923), the more senior name, was adopted for the combined genus.",
              "[34] Oxyuranus microlepidotus has been the fierce snake's binomial name since the early 1980s.",
              "[34][35] The generic name Oxyuranus is from Greek oxys \"sharp, needle-like\", and ouranos \"an arch\" (specifically the arch of the heavens) and refers to the needle-like anterior process on the arch of the palate.",
              "[36] The specific name microlepidotus means \"small-scaled\" (Latin).",
              "Hence the common name, \"small-scaled snake\".",

              "[10] The inland taipan inhabits the black soil plains in the semiarid regions where the Queensland and South Australia borders converge.",
              "[7][38] In Queensland, the snake has been observed in Channel Country region[39] (e.",

              "[2][7] Like every Australian snake, the inland taipan is protected by law.",
              "[30] Conservation status for the snake was assessed for the IUCN Red List for the first time in July 2017, and in 2018, was designated as least concern, stating, \"This species is listed as least concern, as it is widespread and overall, it is not considered to be declining.",

              "This annoying, biting, long-legged insect is not just a nuisance, it carries many deadly and debilitating diseases such as malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya and lymphatic filariasis (also known as elephantiasis, one of the world\u2019s leading causes of disability).",
              "The mosquito kills more people than any other creature in the world.",
              "Even today, almost one million people a year die from mosquito-borne disease.",
              "There are over 3,000 mosquito species, but few consume human blood and transmit disease.",
              "The most dangerous mosquitoes are certain species of Anopheles, Aedea and Culex.",
              "Aedes aegypti alone spreads lymphatic filariasis, Zika, dengue and yellow fever.",
              "The Anopheles mosquito, which is the main spreader of malaria in tropical and sub-tropical climates, can be found on every continent except Antarctica and its range is spreading north and south with climate change.",
              "Killing mosquitoes is, therefore, an obvious, and deceptively simple way of keeping some major diseases at bay.",
              "Mass-spraying of insecticides is still used to counter the outbreak of mosquito-borne disease, such as when Zika arrived in Florida, but its effects are not limited to the enemy and many other insects, including bees, butterflies, and other pollinators, are severely affected, so more targeted measures are sought.",
              "Insecticide-treated bed nets, produced from the late 1980s, are deemed responsible for two-thirds of the seven million lives saved from malaria between 2000 and 2015, mainly in Africa.",
              "They are seen as a cornerstone of malaria prevention and control efforts.",
              "However, mosquitoes are becoming resistant to insecticides, whether mass-sprayed or added to mosquito nets.",
              "More effective interventions against mosquito-borne diseases are needed and these will rely more and more on knowledge of local mosquito species and their host-seeking behaviour as well as a deeper understanding of the conditions that increase or decrease risk of infection.",
              "Good timing of interventions can make a big difference.",
              "Ideally mosquito populations should be reduced before they trigger an outbreak of disease.",
              "Several large-scale experiments in using genetically modified mosquitoes to control populations are being run in different locations around the world.",
              "There are two main approaches.",
              "In the first, sterile male mosquitos are mass produced and released into the wild.",
              "These sterile males mate with wild females who then lay sterile eggs which will not hatch.",
              "This approach has been shown to reduce wild populations by as much as 90% in trials with Aedes aegypt.",
              "The second approach is to introduce a gene that, if inherited, results in the death of the female, but not the male.",
              "Genetically modified males are mass produced and released.",
              "Only male offspring from matings between the modified males and wild females survive.",
              "They go on to breed, further spreading the female-killing gene and reducing the overall mosquito population.",

              "aegypti), not other types of mosquitoes, leaving ecosystems intact.",
              "Genetically modifying mosquitos Producing genetically modified mosquitos is a laborious process.",

              "Professor Luke Alphey, an arthropod geneticist at The Pirbright Institute explains: \u201cThis is a very delicate micro-injection procedure that is technically demanding.",
              "Although we have quite a good success rate, we still need to inject 1,000 or so eggs to get about 100 fully grown adults.",
              "These are then bred to see which one can transmit the gene of interest to a next generation.",
              "And you might have to screen 10,000 or so individuals in the next generation to find the one.",

              "Only the species of interest is affected.",

              "But greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) aren\u2019t simply enhancing color that\u2019s already there;",
              "they\u2019re also fighting the sun\u2019s bleaching effect on it, researchers report in the October Ecology and Evolution.",
              "Feathers with a thicker coating of this serum held their color better than those with less, analysis shows.",
              "Flamingos\u2019 feathers help the birds fly, keep their bodies dry and attract mates.",
              "The feathers get their red color from carotenoids, molecules responsible for many natural pigments, found in the birds\u2019 steady diet of brine shrimp and algae.",
              "When flamingos preen, they care for their feathers a bit like how we care for our hair, cleaning out accumulated dirt and parasites.",
              "And like some of us, they add color.",
              "To apply their DIY feather dye, flamingos rub their cheeks on a gland above their tail called the uropygial gland, which generates a color-carrying serum.",
              "The birds then rub their serum-coated cheeks on their feathers and sway their necks to make sure the dye sticks.",
              "All that effort, paired with some slick dance moves, is aimed at attracting potential mates.",
              "But the sun\u2019s ultraviolet radiation can break down carotenoids.",
              "That got Maria Cecilia Chiale, a biologist at Universidad Nacional de La Plata in Argentina, wondering if flamingos lose their color without constant reapplication of the serum.",
              "If so, that might help explain their instinct to constantly \u201ctouch up\u201d their plumage.",
              "Chiale and her collaborators collected dozens of neck feathers from flamingos in France that had died in a cold snap (SN: 10/16/14).",
              "The team scanned the feathers and used Adobe Photoshop to analyze their color, and then placed half of them on a roof, exposed to sunlight.",
              "The other half were kept in darkness.",
              "Forty days later, new scans to analyze the feathers\u2019 color intensity showed that the exposed feathers were sun-faded and paler than those kept in the dark.",
              "Before the exposure experiment, Chiale had extracted carotenoids from both the surface and interior of each feather.",
              "After exposure, she found that feathers with a greater concentration of carotenoids had kept more color.",
              "That suggests that the birds had applied more serum to those feathers, letting them withstand fading better than those with a thinner coating.",
              "Flamingos actively work to maintain their blushed necks throughout their lengthy display season as they prepare to mate, the research suggests;",

              "However, when a baby flamingo first hatches from its egg, it is, in fact, a pale gray fluffy bundle that emerges, rather than the hot pink we associate with these graceful tropical waders.",
              "Read on to learn more about how flamingos get their instantly recognizable color.",
              "One commonly offered reason for Flamingos being so fabulously pink lies in their diet, rather than their DNA.",
              "Known to have a diet rich in crustaceans, is it simply that a flamingo\u2019s feathers take their color from the pinkish-orange shrimps they are known to be particularly fond of?",
              "Well, not exactly.",
              "Shrimps get their color from feeding on algae rich in carotenoid pigments, which causes both the shrimps and the flamingos that eat them to be pink in color.",
              "Flamingos fed on algae and shrimps lacking this pigment would remain pure white.",
              "A Lesser Flamingo - One commonly offered reason for Flamingos being so fabulously pink lies in their diet, rather than their DNA From pure white Swans and Egrets to jet-black Crows, and Ravens, bird species exist with plumages that encompass the whole color spectrum, including the Scarlet Ibis, yellow Canaries and bright green Parakeets.",

              "Carotenoids, including beta carotene and lutein, are pigments that are present in several bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals with yellow, orange and red coloring, for example in autumn leaves, carrots, grapefruits, corn and pumpkins.",
              "Spirulina, a widespread algae in alkaline waters of lakes and ponds, has an extremely high concentration of beta-carotene.",

              "A Flamingo's primary diet is taken from the lagoons it wades through, sifting out algae, brine shrimp and other invertebrates with its broad, curved bill.",
              "The salty, alkaline waters that form the typical habitats of Famingos do not support many species, but algae and the crustaceans that feed on them thrive, making them ideal foraging grounds.",
              "The microscopic blue-green algae that are present in these waters and ingested by both Flamingos and the crustaceans that make up the majority of their diet are packed with carotenoids, the pigment compounds that generate the pink-orange coloring of their plumage.",
              "Enzymes in the Flamingos\u2019 liver then break down these compounds into pink and orange pigment molecules, which are then carried to the feathers, legs and beaks of Flamingos, causing them to take on the familiar rosy pink appearance.",
              "The color of a Flamingo\u2019s plumage is heavily influenced by the availability and quality of food in its local environment.",
              "Ponds and pools with low numbers of crustaceans or lower levels of algae, do not contain a high enough density of carotenoids to produce deep pink hues, meaning that birds living and feeding in these environments are not as pink as those where algae and brine shrimp flourish.",

              "By seven to ten days, a flamingo chick\u2019s legs and bill will have turned black, but there\u2019s still a long way to go before they look like a \u2018proper\u2019 Flamingo.",
              "During the early weeks of life, young Flamingos rely on their parents to feed them with crop milk, an intense process which leaves parent Flamingos a less vibrant shade of pink, due to the energy and resources they need to pass onto their offspring.",
              "Juvenile Flamingos shed their initial down and molt into a gray plumage, as they master flight and hunting.",
              "As they grow and become more independent, foraging to meet their own dietary needs, their plumage also changes, with their maturity and ability to fend for themselves reflected in the pinkness they develop.",

              "The grade of the color of a Flamingo\u2019s feathers is influenced by the availability of blue-green algae in their foraging grounds.",
              "Interestingly, the Flamingo species with the richest coloring are those that ingest larger amounts of algae directly, rather than gaining smaller quantities of carotenoids second-hand as a by-product of eating shrimps and other crustaceans that have eaten them first.",

              "Until chicks become fully independent, it\u2019s usual for parents to lose their bright pink hue, becoming pale and washed out, and even fully white.",
              "When they hatch, baby Flamingos are gray, and look nothing like the hook-billed ballerina-esque pink waders we all recognize instantly.",
              "Developing full pinkness is a gradual process, with young chicks a mottled shade of gray and white when they hatch, gradually becoming a uniform gray as juvenile birds, and only becoming their signature hot pink hue when they are between one and two years old.",
              "Diet plays a role in the coloring of several bird and animal species, including salmon, American Goldfinches, Cedar Waxwings and even Frilled Dragons.",
              "Once again, the pigments responsible are carotenoids, which are present in the diets of these species in varying forms. American Goldfinches take their bright yellow feathers from seeds rich in carotenoids, while the tail feathers of Cedar Waxwings are also affected by the amount of red berries they eat, and can be variously orange, red or yellow.",
              "If Flamingos in zoos are not fed their natural diet, it is possible for this to cause disruption to the amount of carotenoids they need in order to retain their trademark pink hue.",
              "Flamingos rely on pink brine shrimp as the main component of their diet in the wild, which in turn feed on blue-green algae, which contains the high concentration of carotenoids that are needed to maintain their bright pink feathers.",

              "Bird House keepers apply this natural thermoregulation to keep the Zoo\u2019s flock warm in the winter, too.",
              "The flamingo pool is heated to 70 degrees Fahrenheit to keep the birds comfortable \u2014 even when it\u2019s snowing.",
              "A group of crows is called a murder, and a group of geese is called a gaggle.",
              "So, what is a group of flamingos called?",
              "A flamboyance!",
              "Other collective nouns for flamingos include stand, colony and pat.",
              "The Zoo\u2019s historic Bird House may be closed for renovations, but keepers continue to care for more than 60 Caribbean flamingos (also called American flamingos) behind the scenes.",
              "In the wild, flamingos sometimes gather by the thousands!",
              "Scientists estimate that there are more than 200,000 Caribbean flamingos in the wild, with populations in the Bahamas and Cuba, Mexico, and the Southern Caribbean \u2014 as well as a small group of about 400-500 in the Gala\u0301pagos Islands.",

              "Greater flamingos are found in parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe.",
              "They are the largest and tallest flamingo species.",
              "Chilean, Andean, and James\u2019s flamingos are found only in South America.",
              "Andean flamingos are the rarest of the six species, with fewer than 40,000 birds.",

              "Flamingo legs actually bend just like human legs.",
              "What looks like a flamingo's knee is really its ankle joint.",
              "A flamingo\u2019s knees are located higher up the legs, hidden by the body and feathers.",
              "Confused?",
              "Think of a flamingo as standing on tiptoe.",
              "When the leg bends, it\u2019s the ankle you see hinging.",
              "Flamingos are typically found in shallow saltwater or brackish waters (where saltwater and freshwater mix).",
              "But some flamingo species breed and raise their young in extremely salty bodies of water, called alkaline or \u201csoda\u201d lakes.",
              "The high concentration of carbonate salts in these lakes is so corrosive that it can burn the skin, making the water uninhabitable for most animals.",
              "Researchers are still uncovering the unique aspects of a flamingo\u2019s physiology \u2014 like tough leg skin \u2014 that help it survive such harsh waters.",
              "The high salt can still be deadly for some flamingo chicks if salt rings build up on their legs, making it impossible for them to walk.",
              "A flamingo\u2019s \u201cmilk\u201d is produced in its crop (part of its throat) and then brought up through its mouth.",
              "It may sound icky, but a flamingo\u2019s crop milk is chock-full of healthy proteins and fats.",
              "Both parents can produce crop milk to feed a flamingo chick until it is old enough to eat on its own.",
              "You may be used to seeing flamingos gathered in large groups on the ground, but they also take flight.",
              "Some flamingos will travel to breed, migrate to a new body of water as seasons change, or move to warmer, lower-altitude areas for the winter.",
              "If flamingos are traveling long distances, they often go by night.",
              "Flamingos can stand on one foot for long periods of time \u2014 even long enough to fall asleep.",
              "But, why do they perform this balancing act?",
              "Research suggests that flamingos use more muscle power when standing on two legs, so standing on one leg may be less tiring.",
              "Scientists also believe that a one-legged stance may help flamingos stay warm.",
              "Birds lose body heat through their limbs.",

              "These massive creatures are vastly too heavy to be able to lift themselves off of the ground, weighing anywhere from 1,322 pounds to 7,716 pounds.",
              "Despite having all of this weight, rhinos are able to run 30 to 40 miles per hour.",
              "They will charge at predators that come after their crash, which is what a herd of rhinoceroses is called.",
              "Most crashes only consist of mothers and babies because male rhinos prefer to live a solitary lifestyle.",
              "Rhinoceroses are known for all pooping in the same areas.",

              "Tortoises are some of the longest-living reptiles on the planet and are known for how slowly they move.",
              "Tortoises lack the speed and dexterity in order to be able to jump.",
              "For the same reasons, Tortoises can\u2019t swim either.",
              "Tortoises may be slow, but they are able to walk nearly four miles per day.",
              "These creatures may be slow, but they are extremely determined.",
              "They are able to live in even the harshest conditions thanks to their double digestive tract, which is able to get every ounce of nutrients and water out of each bite.",
              "Snakes may lack legs, but every inch of their long body is filled with muscles that give the snake total control over how they choose to move.",
              "While snakes may be able to jet themselves forward with these muscles, they aren\u2019t able to lift themselves off the ground through muscle power alone.",
              "Due to their lack of external ears, snakes are also unable to hear anything.",
              "No amount of sound will scare off a snake.",
              "They still have internal ears, which are used to help them balance.",
              "Snakes lack eyelids, which makes them unable to blink.",
              "Instead, snakes have eye spectacles that are used to protect the eyes.",
              "The spectacle is shed with the rest of the snake\u2019s skin.",
              "Slugs are in a similar situation as snakes when it comes to the idea of jumping.",
              "They lack legs, but they also lack muscle strength.",
              "Instead, they have a sticky slime that follows them everywhere they go.",
              "With slugs being invertebrates, they lack a spine.",
              "They also lack any kind of bones, teeth, or tongue.",
              "Instead, most of their body is one, large foot muscle that helps them crawl along the ground.",
              "Slugs also have a radula, which is a special organ that grinds up food with thousands of protrusions.",
              "These slimy critters are able to breed and fertilize their own eggs.",
              "Slugs are hermaphrodites, which means they have both male and female reproductive organs.",
              "Their eggs are able to stay dormant for years and will wait to hatch until the environment is right.",
              "Opossums are one of the few marsupials that are unable to jump.",
              "It is important to remember that possums and opossums are two different animals, despite opossums frequently being shortened to possum.",
              "Possums are the cute, chinchilla-like animals from Australia and opossums are the large, rat-like animals from the United States.",
              "Opossums may not be able to jump, but they are excellent at climbing.",
              "They are known for their ability to act like they\u2019re dead when threatened.",
              "However, an opossum has no control over when they play dead.",
              "It is a response that comes from the animal\u2019s inability to handle the stress.",
              "Ticks are tiny, dangerous creatures that are able to crawl onto your flesh and firmly latch themselves on as they begin their parasitic tendencies.",
              "They get onto your skin by crawling or landing onto you, whether it be through you lying on the ground or rubbing against tall grass.",
              "Ticks don\u2019t even need to jump or fly in order to land on their host.",
              "These arachnids hide in blades of grass and leaves of plants until their host knocks them off.",
              "Then, the tick uses their legs to clasp onto the flesh of their prey.",
              "If you spot a tick on you or your pet, you will need to remove it immediately.",
              "It only takes 24 to 48 hours of a tick sucking on their host\u2019s blood for them to be able to give the host Lyme disease.",
              "Leeches are carnivorous worms that squirm through bodies of water, looking for their next meal.",
              "Leeches lack the muscles needed to jump and spend the majority of their lives in water.",
              "The only time they leave the water is when they\u2019re attached to a host.",
              "Not every leech has a taste for human blood.",
              "There\u2019s only one type of leech that sucks blood, most others prefer mollusks and bugs.",
              "Even the bloodsucking leeches prefer the blood of frogs and turtles to human blood.",
              "Sea anemone are the nearly plant-like animals that are closely related to jellyfish.",
              "Their plant-like features are what prevent them from jumping.",
              "Despite their lack of movement, sea anemone still have their own way of surviving.",
              "The sea anemone doesn\u2019t move, so food has to come to it.",
              "Their stinging cells capture prey that hide in it and repel predators who want to eat it.",
              "They can be found attached to rocks or burrowed in the sea floor.",
              "Sea cucumbers may have incredibly simple body structures, but their bodies are capable of incredible things.",
              "Due to the simplicity of their bodies, they are unable to jump.",
              "Instead, they are able to regrow parts of themselves that are eaten or torn apart.",
              "Sea cucumbers live for five to 10 years.",
              "In this time, they can be as small as 0.",
              "75 inches to as large as 6.",
              "5 feet.",
              "They get this large by eating plenty of algae, tiny aquatic animals, or even eating waste materials.",
              "Worms may be able to live in space, but they are unable to jump due to lack of proper muscle mass or structure.",
              "Despite there being about 2,700 different species of earthworms, none of them have what it takes to get themselves off of the ground.",
              "Earthworms are able to regrow and essentially clone themselves with the pieces of themselves that are split apart.",
              "This is thanks to all the stem cells that are packed in an earthworm\u2019s body.",
              "These worms are able to reach massive sizes, some species reaching 12 feet long.",
              "The largest earthworm was 22 feet long and was found in South Africa.",
              "Lice and ticks share quite a lot in common.",
              "Both of these pests are unable to jump but are still able to cause pain and illness to humans.",
              "They are most commonly spread by the sharing of clothing and personal items, such as brushes or towels.",
              "Lice have three stages of life.",
              "They start as an egg or nit.",
              "The next stage is their nymph form, which begins after they hatch.",
              "It only takes nymphs nine to 12 days in order to fully develop.",
              "The final stage of life for lice is adulthood.",
              "When fully grown, lice are only about the size of a sesame tree.",
              "Lice will appear darker on dark hair and lighter on light hair.",
              "Horseshoe crabs and ticks are unable to jump for the same reason.",
              "They are more closely related to one another than horseshoe crabs are to crabs.",
              "Horseshoe crabs are arachnids.",
              "They lack the proper muscle structure for jumping and have an incredibly heavy shell weighing down their legs.",
              "The shell of a horseshoe crab doesn\u2019t grow with the crab, so it must be molted about 16 times during the horseshoe crab\u2019s 10-year growth period.",
              "These odd creatures have nine eyes and multiple light receptors along their telson, the appendage that looks like a tail.",
              "Giraffes aren\u2019t able to jump because they never need to jump and are too heavy for their thin legs to lift off of the ground.",
              "These lanky mammals are capable of growing 14 to 18 feet tall.",

              "In the wild, elephants have no need to jump, and jumping elephants have never been necessary.",
              "They can reach high places to eat, and their size and strength can scare off predators.",
              "Therefore, this mammal has not adapted to jumping because of its ecological value.",
              "Nevertheless, they are still able to move quickly and are considered one of the most agile animals on the planet.",
              "Even though they cannot jump, they can still run up to 25 miles per hour and swim for long distances.",
              "Their size and strength also make them one of the most powerful animals in the world.",
              "They are able to use their trunk as a weapon and can destroy anything in their path.",

              "In fact, hippos are more like elephants than they are like other animals in the same family.",
              "They are very large and bulky, which makes it difficult for them to get airborne.",
              "Moreover, hippos are not very good swimmers.",
              "They tend to sink rather than float, so they would have a hard time crossing a river or body of water.",
              "A hippo\u2019s weight is one of its best defenses against predators.",
              "When predators enter their territory, the hippo is quick to defend what is theirs.",
              "They are extremely dangerous and have been known to fiercely attack any animal that threatens them.",
              "Their size also makes them difficult to take down, and their thick skin provides additional protection.",
              "If you see a hippo staring at you, it\u2019s going to honk and snort you.",
              "It is a way that the hippo indicated the threat before attacking.",

              "These curious creatures are known for their slow movements and odd appearance.",
              "They are known to spend most of their time hanging upside down from tree branches.",
              "Their lack of ability to jump is thought to be one of the reasons why they are so slow.",
              "Sloths have very short legs in relation to their body size, and their claws are also very sharp.",
              "This combination makes it difficult for them to get enough traction to jump.",
              "They have the ability to jump, but their slow motion often prevents them from doing so.",
              "Their slow movements help them to conserve energy, which is essential in the rainforest where they live.",
              "Sloths have long and robust limbs that help to support their weight as they hang from branches.",
              "Their limbs are covered in coarse hair, which provides additional grip.",

              "Many of the sloth\u2019s predators live in the forest ground, therefore the sloths spend most of their time hanging in the trees.",
              "They only come down to the ground for poop, which happens once a week.",
              "Rhinos are among the mammals that cannot jump because of their anatomy.",
              "They have short front legs and long back legs, which gives them a center of gravity that is too low to allow them to jump.",
              "Their bodies are designed for moving forward rather than upward, making it difficult for them to generate the power necessary to leave the ground.",
              "Also, rhinos are extremely heavy, weighing in at several thousand pounds.",
              "Their thick legs are also relatively short, which makes it difficult for them to generate the power needed to jump.",
              "Rhinos have weak ankles and knees that are not designed for jumping.",
              "The combination of weight, leg length, and joint weakness make it impossible for a rhino to jump even a few inches off the ground.",
              "In fact, if a rhino tried to jump, it would likely injure itself due to the immense amount of force placed on its joints.",
              "Porcupines cannot jump because their bodies are not built for it.",
              "Being a mammal, their legs are short and their claws are not very strong.",
              "The quills on their back make it difficult for them to move their body in a way that would allow them to jump.",
              "When a porcupine wants to get from one place to another, it will usually climb instead of trying to jump.",
              "The porcupine\u2019s sharp quills are effective self-defense, but it has no ability to jump away from the way of an attacker.",
              "The 30,000 quills on a porcupine\u2019s body are a powerful defense against any potential predator.",
              "Actually, these quills can cut through bone and puncture muscle and fat to reach vital organs.",
              "To the point of death, some people have reportedly stabbed themselves in the heart with porcupine quills.",
              "To make matters worse, these quills are barbed, meaning they will attach to flesh and be extremely painful and difficult to remove.",
              "Researchers from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute discovered that porcupines never jumped from tree to tree, but instead hung to improvised bridges out of interconnecting branches.",
              "The opossum is a marsupial native to the Americas.",
              "It is the only animal in its family, and it is closely related to opossums found in other parts of the world.",
              "One of the most distinguishing features of the opossum is its ability to climb.",
              "It has sharp claws and a long prehensile tail that it uses to grip branches and tree trunks.",
              "However, despite their excellent climbing skills, the opossums are not able to jump.",
              "This is because its legs are too short and its body is too heavy.",
              "When faced with a predator, the opossums will usually try to flee by running or climbing away.",
              "If it is cornered, it will sometimes play dead in order to escape.",
              "However, due to its lack of jumping ability, the opossums are at a disadvantage when it comes to fleeing from predators.",

              "Some mammals lack these physical characteristics, which is why they are not able to jump like other animals.",
              "While it might seem like a disadvantage to not be able to jump, it\u2019s important to remember that each animal has evolved to best suit its needs and environment.",

              "It\u2019s going to take a little bit of time for this to happen.",
              "It should take approximately two weeks for a male clownfish to fully transform into a female clownfish.",
              "After this period of time has passed, the clownfish will be able to do everything that a female clownfish is supposed to be able to do.",
              "The clownfish can start to lay eggs, and it\u2019ll be able to go through the normal mating rituals with the male clownfish.",
              "Other fish are capable of doing gender changes such as this as well, but clownfish are just some of the most popular examples of fish that can change gender.",
              "One thing that you should know is that clownfish can\u2019t just change genders all the time.",
              "When a male turns into a female clownfish, it\u2019s not going to be able to shift back to its former male state.",
              "This is a one-time transformation that will cause the male clownfish to become the dominant female of the group.",
              "Everything is set in stone once the male has changed into a female.",
              "Many people have misconceptions about clownfish.",
              "They think that being able to change genders means that they can change at any time.",
              "As you can see, there are limits on what the ability to change gender looks like with these fish.",
              "There\u2019s only one female in a group, and that female remains a female for the rest of its life.",
              "You can consider all clownfish to be hermaphrodites.",
              "All clownfish are born in a male state, but they possess both sets of sexual organs.",

              "The smaller clownfish in a group might only ever be submissive non-breeding males.",
              "It just depends on whether they ever get the chance to shift into a breeding role when one of the larger clownfish dies.",
              "This is how the biology of clownfish works.",
              "They\u2019re born with both sets of sexual organs, but they stay in a male state unless they meet the criteria in a group to become a female.",
              "Two female clownfish are absolutely not going to be able to get along.",
              "If you were to put two female clownfish in the same tank, then the two would fight.",
              "It\u2019s not just that the two would come into conflict sometimes either.",
              "Two female clownfish will not be able to tolerate the existence of another female in the same space.",
              "They will wind up fighting to the death, and that\u2019s not something that you want to see happen in your home aquarium.",

              "If you have multiple pairs of established clownfish, then it\u2019s better to give each pair their own environment.",
              "Clownfish are aggressive and they don\u2019t get along with other clownfish that invade their territory.",
              "There are instances where people have been able to successfully add new clownfish to a group, but this often doesn\u2019t work out.",
              "It\u2019ll have no chance of working out if you put another female clownfish in the fish tank when you already have a female clownfish.",
              "There are different opinions on this, but most experts recommend just keeping two clownfish in one fish tank.",
              "You can keep one dominant female clownfish and one male clownfish in the same aquarium.",
              "In the wild, these fish can live in groups of three to five.",
              "However, things are quite a bit different in a fish tank.",
              "Since clownfish are aggressive fish by nature, they\u2019re not going to like it if they feel that they don\u2019t have enough space.",
              "Sometimes having three or four clownfish in the same tank will lead to the breeding pair severely picking on the smaller clownfish.",
              "This can even lead to the death of the smaller clownfish in some situations.",
              "It\u2019s a lot easier to just care for two clownfish at once since they will get along just fine.",
              "Some even say that keeping one clownfish in your fish tank will be acceptable.",
              "Others find keeping only one fish in the tank to be cruel.",
              "For the most part, it\u2019s not going to be acceptable to mix different types of clownfish.",

              "If you were to buy Percula clownfish and then you later try to put Maroon clownfish in the same fish tank, then the two sets of fish will wind up fighting.",
              "The fighting could even wind up proving fatal to one group of clownfish.",
              "You have to understand that clownfish are an aggressive type of fish that won\u2019t like other types of clownfish being around.",
              "There have been people who have been able to keep multiple types of clownfish in the same tank, but this usually involves having a huge aquarium.",
