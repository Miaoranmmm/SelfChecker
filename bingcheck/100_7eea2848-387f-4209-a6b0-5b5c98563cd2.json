              "The scutoid is a basic three-dimensional shape, like a cube or a sphere but not like either of those things.",
              "It\u2019s more like a column with half of one end lopped off at an angle;",
              "popular accounts have described it as a twisted prism, although that\u2019s not so helpful.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s a prism with a zipper,\u201d Javier Buceta, a biophysicist at Lehigh University and one of the scutoid\u2019s discoverers, told me excitedly.",
              "This was also not so helpful.",
              "What matters is that mathematicians had never before conceived of the scutoid, much less given it a name.",
              "What matters even more is that scutoids turn out to be everywhere, especially in living things.",
              "The shape, however odd, is a building block of multicellular organisms;",

              "\u201d One of the many mysteries of living cells is how they manage to blossom into coherent many-celled units.",
              "A person or a platypus begins as a single cell, which divides into more cells, which also divide and subdivide.",
              "Some of these, the epithelial cells, are destined to become tissues and organs.",
              "The cells collect into layers, which bend and fold into greater-than sums: ovaries, kidneys, a heart.",
              "In part, it\u2019s a packing challenge, a geometry problem;",
              "as the layers twist and curve, the individual cells change shape in accordance with the whole, and they do so as efficiently as possible.",
              "Buceta offered the analogy of a Roman arch.",
              "You can form rectangular cobblestones into a straight row, but to form a curve the stones must be reshaped so that one face\u2014the bottom end, on the inside of the arch\u2014is smaller than the top face.",
              "The stone is no longer rectangular;",
              "it\u2019s more like a pyramid with the pointy end lopped off.",
              "Mathematicians call that shape a frustum.",
              "Similar dynamics apply in biology.",
              "When epithelial cells pack together in a layer of flat tissue, each will often take the shape of a column with five or six sides\u2014a prism.",
              "As the tissue grows and bends, some cells deform, with one end becoming wider than the other;",
              "this allows the tissue to have a larger area on its outer surface than it does on its inner side.",
              "Biologists had long assumed that these cells acquire the shape of frusta, as in a Roman arch.",
              "(A frustum may be four-sided, like a pyramid, but it also can have more sides than that.)",
              "But, as Buceta and his colleagues reported in Nature Communications, that isn\u2019t always the case.",
              "\u201cThe way those cells pack together in three dimensions is actually kind of weird,\u201d Buceta said.",
              "The researchers developed a computer model to simulate what happens to individual cells in curved tissue.",
              "The cells pack together along faces and edges, but building and maintaining these borders takes energy, and each cell wants to use as little as possible.",
              "\u201cThe larger the contact, the more energy they have to spend,\u201d Buceta said.",
              "The team found that the total length of those contacting borders is smallest, and the packing most efficient, when at least some of the cells take the shape of scutoids.",
              "\u201cWhere you have curvature, you have scutoids,\u201d Buceta said.",
              "Buceta was keen to send me a diagram of a scutoid, to explain what one looks like, but I pressed him for a verbal description.",
              "Picture an upright column with five sides: two pentagons, one at the top and one at the base, attached point-to-point by five lines.",
              "And, um, suppose this pentagonal column is a tent and that one of the vertical edges, where two of the five faces meet, is a zipper.",
              "Now unzip it from the bottom, to midway up, and fold back the flaps: you\u2019ve created a triangular face and turned the pentagonal floor into a hexagon.",
              "From the side, it looks as if a wedge of the column has been sliced away.",
              "That columnar shape\u2014five-sided at the top, six-sided at the bottom, minus a triangular wedge\u2014is a scutoid.",
              "Yeah, hard to visualize.",
              "The Internet quickly jumped in to help.",
              "A few minutes after we spoke, Buceta sent me a link to a YouTube video in which a young boy displayed a Lego-like model of a scutoid.",
              "Over the weekend, someone updated Wikipedia with an entry for the shape, describing it, in part, as \u201ca geometric solid between two parallel surfaces\u201d in which \u201cthe boundary of each of the surfaces (and of all the other parallel surfaces between them) is a polygon, and the vertices of the two end polygons are joined by either by a curve or a Y-shaped connection.",
              "\u201d At first, the researchers didn\u2019t know what to call it.",
              "\u201cWhen we found the shape, we said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk to the mathematicians\u2014for sure they know the name of this,\u2019 \u201d Buceta said.",
              "\u201cBut they couldn\u2019t give us a name, because it didn\u2019t have a name.",
              "We had to find one!",
              "\u201d They noticed that the shape vaguely resembled the back end of a beetle, a structure called a scutellum.",
              "Hence, \u201cscutoid.",
              "\u201d The team\u2019s accomplishment was more than theoretical.",
              "Having predicted the existence of the scutoid, the researchers went looking for it in nature and soon found it in abundance.",
              "They examined the developing embryos of fruit flies and watched as individual epithelial cells divided, aggregated, curved, and folded to form salivary glands and egg chambers.",
              "Visible within the tissue matrices were scutoids: more where the tissue curved the most, none where the tissue was flat.",
              "And scutoids are as likely to be found among mature cells as in developing tissue, Buceta said.",
              "So, I asked, even at this very moment, we are made up of scutoids?",
              "\u201cYes,\u201d he said.",
              "\u201cYes, we are.",
              "\u201d Buceta said that the discovery might be helpful to scientists who are trying to create artificial organs and tissues in the lab.",
              "Such efforts often begin with some sort of scaffolding on which the epithelial cells grow and self-organize;",
              "adding scutoids to the mix could help the cells form together more efficiently.",
              "One day, when the powers of the scutoid are fully grasped, humankind might honor it with monuments: the Great Scutoids of Giza, the Scutoid of Kukulkan, the Scutoid of the Sun.",
              "For now, Buceta is satisfied with the name.",
              "\u201cIn our line of work, you normally don\u2019t have many opportunities to name something,\u201d Buceta said.",

When it became clear that the shape was new to geometry, they named it after the scutellum, the part of a beetle's thorax that vaguely resembles the newly christened scutoid.",

              "Social interactions were found to be related to age, personality, presence of calves in the herd, relatedness to other elephants in the herd and species (African or Asian).",
              "Calves engaged in the greatest amount of positive interactions but no extreme aggression was observed between any individuals, which was considered indicative of good social management.",
              "Increasing understanding about social structures that are affecting elephant relationships enables targeted management plans to be created, in order to provide elephants with the most appropriate social environments.",
              "These findings support the recommendations that elephants should be housed in related herds with multiple ages wherever possible, but they also highlight that unrelated elephants can still form compatible and successful social groups.",
              "Elephants have complex social systems that are predominantly driven by ecological factors in situ.",
              "Within zoos, elephants are held in relatively static social groups and the factors observed driving social relationships in the wild are largely absent.",
              "Little research has investigated the effect of social group factors in zoos on elephant social interactions.",
              "The aim of this research was to establish whether there is a relationship between social group factors and social behaviour, in order to identify factors that make elephant herds more or less likely to be compatible.",
              "Results will facilitate recommendations for optimum social groupings for zoo elephants.",
              "Behavioural data quantifying social interactions were collected between January 2016 and February 2017 at seven UK and Irish zoos and safari parks from 10 African and 22 Asian elephants.",
              "Social interactions were split into four categories: positive physical, positive non-physical, negative physical and negative non-physical.",
              "Social interactions were related to age (positive physical higher and negative non-physical lower in calves than adults), personality (elephants with higher sociability scores engaged in more positive interactions and less negative interactions), presence of calves in the herd (herds with calves had more positive non-physical), relatedness to other elephants in the herd (positive non-physical were higher when relatives were in the group and negative non-physical were higher between unrelated elephants) and species (Asian elephants engaged in more positive non-physical than African elephants).",
              "A greater understanding of factors that may contribute to the success of zoo-elephant social groups is important for individual and herd welfare as it will enable evidence-based decisions which have minimal impact on social structures to be executed.",
              "This knowledge will enable proactive management approaches to be undertaken and will thus be paramount in ensuring optimal welfare for elephant herds moving forwards.",
              "Elephants have one of the most advanced mammalian social systems [1].",
              "In situ, they live in complex fission\u2013fusion societies [2,3] and display strong affiliative behaviours.",
              "The main driving force behind wild elephant social structures and herd dynamics are ecological factors, such as availability of resources and risk of predation [4,5].",
              "Wild elephants predominantly live in related groups of varying sizes;",
              "however, researchers have observed behavioural flexibility and adaptability in social groups [6,7,8].",

              "A range of factors can affect the success of social groups in zoo environments (reviewed in Williams et al.",
              "[12]), where environments are typically more static than animals experience in the wild.",

              "Elephant keepers and researchers have highlighted the importance of providing elephants with compatible groups, comprising a range of ages and access to others at night [25].",

              "Current research and elephant management guidelines suggest that, wherever possible, elephants should be housed in related, multigenerational family herds [11,25,28,29,30,31].",

              "high infant survival and low incidences of abortion, stillbirth and parental neglect [32].",
              "Moreover, providing chimpanzees with the opportunity to engage in fission\u2013fusion dynamics akin to wild-type interactions led to low aggression rates and reduced aggressive interactions [33], however there is controversy surrounding using the wild as an optimum standard [34,35] and housing zoo animals in wild-type social groups is difficult to do in some species [12].",
              "For example, in large species, such as elephants, replicating wild-type social groups can be logistically difficult, and requirements are likely to vary according to individual circumstances [36].",
              "Therefore, identifying the elements of the wild-type social group that animals require for good welfare within zoos is of paramount importance.",

              "However, it could also be that older elephants do not need to perform physical reassuring behaviours as frequently as calves.",
              "The latter theory is supported by the lack of significant relationship between origin of elephants and frequency of social interactions in this study.",
              "Elephant calves develop at a faster rate when they are exposed to physical contact [62] and touch in elephant calves plays a role in normal development as well as enabling young elephants to test their strengths and capabilities with one another [52,63,64].",
              "Calves are described as the herd nucleus in elephant groups [9,65] and in the wild the allomothering of calves works to increase both calf survival and group stability [63].",
              "Touching (or trunk to-) behaviour could be a reinforcement of the social bond in the direction of older female to calf or it could be a result of a need for reassurance from the calf.",
              "It could also represent a change in social interactions as individuals grow older.",
              "Wild adult elephants do engage in elaborate greeting rituals following separations, even if separation lasts for only a few minutes [66].",

              "[27] advocated the need for herd structures with a range of ages, and these findings support this notion, but only for breeding herds, to provide companionship for youngest elephants and appropriate opportunities for social learning as they develop.",
              "However, an absence of calves in a herd does not necessarily lead to poor welfare.",
              "A lack of elephant calves did not lead to a lack of interactions within the study herds;",

              "Genetic relatedness predicts fission and fusion of social groups in wild African elephants, and associations between social groups persist long after original maternal kin have passed away [73] but genetic relatedness is not the sole driver of wild elephant social relationships [6,8,45,46].",

              "Not all of the investigated factors were related to social interaction frequency.",
              "There was no relationship between social interactions (physical or non-physical) and elephant origin, which suggests that neither being born into a zoo nor coming from the wild predicts the ability of individuals to exist in a functional social group, a very important and promising finding for zoo elephants.",
              "It suggests that if provided with an appropriate social environment there is the potential to maintain good welfare for all zoo elephants, regardless of prior experiences or birth place.",
              "There was also no behavioural difference between male and female elephants although this finding could be affected by the low number of adult bulls observed.",
              "In the wild, there is a great deal of variation in terms of behavioural development in bulls and cows [76] and this should be borne in mind when providing bull elephants with social companions in zoos.",

              "Elephant management guidelines are relatively lacking in terms of the needs of bull elephants [77].",
              "It is therefore advocated that further research is undertaken to explore potential differences between the social needs of male and female elephants.",
              "There was no relationship between positive physical interactions and relatedness to others, origin, zoo, sex, species, herd size or presence of a calf in the herd, and no relationships were observed between negative physical interactions and any of the investigated factors.",
              "The lack of evidence to support a link between group size and prosocial behaviour lends empirical evidence to support arguments made by elephant keepers and researchers that, within reason, compatibility of elephants is of greater importance than a minimum group size [25].",
              "These findings may, however, be due to the low frequency of physical interactions recorded during the study.",
              "Further investigation of elephant sociability in terms of association data may reveal more relationships with the investigated factors and lend further support to these initial important findings.",
              "It is likely that it is a combination of multiple, interacting factors that are affecting the success of elephant social groups, and it is important to recognise that the structure of social groups can change over time and should be managed accordingly.",

              "However, it is recommended that further research is undertaken to monitor change in relationships over time, especially as young animals develop or when individuals are moved to create new herds.",
              "Future work should also seek to investigate the relationship between physical interactions, proximity to other elephants and measures of a number of indicators of welfare, to further understand the relationship between physical interactions, proximity and physical and physiological welfare.",
              "Establishing a greater understanding of herd dynamics and the role of social behaviour in elephant welfare will support evidence-based management which will help to optimise welfare.",
              "Methodologies used in this study have applicability in other socially housed zoo species, determining social requirements in order to provide good welfare.",
              "Appropriate social groups comprising compatible individuals can be one of the hardest things to provide social species in zoos, especially an animal with needs as complex as an elephant.",
              "Historically, researchers looked to wild elephant social groups to predict zoo elephant social wants and needs, but the zoo environment is artificial and social groups are more fixed than in the wild.",
              "Furthermore, the pressures driving social group formation and existence are not present within zoos, and so factors driving social group success in zoos may be different to the wild.",
              "The occurrence of positive social interactions has been identified as an important yet understudied indicator of welfare in zoo elephant social groups.",
              "Recent research has begun to focus more on social interactions in zoo elephants and current guidelines recognise the importance of individual compatibility.",
              "It is likely that a number of factors may affect zoo elephant social relationships and identification of these is important for future welfare.",
              "The results from this study show that elephant social interactions are related to age, personality, presence of calves in a herd, relatedness and species.",
              "Whilst it is important to recognise that these factors may be to some extent overlapping, this study has made important first steps to identify things that may be affecting the success of zoo elephant relationships.",
              "These results must, however, be interpreted with some caution and it is recommended that this preliminary research should be repeated to enable zoo-wide recommendations to be made.",
              "The most interconnected group was the largest group with the greatest number of calves, however elephants held in smaller groups also engaged in a range of prosocial behaviour.",
              "The lack of a statistically significant link between herd size and positive social behaviour lends evidence to support suggestions by elephant keepers that the recommended minimum group size of four individuals (currently a criterion in the SSSMZP elephant management guidelines) may not be as important as compatibility for individual elephant welfare.",
              "The degree to which elephants can be considered sociable is individual.",
              "Being able to predict factors that may contribute to the success of social groups is important for individual and herd welfare.",

              "Finally, rates of aggression, prosocial behavior (affiliative behaviors that promote positive social bonds between elephants), and submissive behavior exhibited by wild and zoo-housed male elephants were associated with age, musth status, the number of elephants presented, and group type (all-male or mixed sex).",

              "In wild male elephants, both musth status and age impacted elephant associations within all-male and mixed-sex groups: non-musth elephants were generally sighted less often in mixed-sex groups as they aged, while the inverse occurred with musth elephants.",
              "Musth status interacted with age to predict the number of conspecifics with which a wild male elephant associated: younger males were observed with more females during non-musth (but the opposite was true during musth), and male elephants between 20 and 30 years were observed with the highest number of male conspecifics except during musth.",
              "Finally, we found variation in aggression, prosocial behavior, and submissive behavior was influenced by intrinsic (age and musth status) and extrinsic factors (group size and type) in similar ways in both populations;",
              "prosocial behavior was most common and was influenced by the number of conspecifics present (both populations), and age, group type, and musth status (zoo population), while aggression was rare, especially among older elephants.",
              "We suggest that longitudinal studies of this threatened species will be particularly helpful to promote the reproduction and conservation of Asian elephants in in-situ and ex-situ environments.",
              "Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) exhibit polygynous mating strategies, whereby males compete to secure as many mating opportunities as they can afford [1,2,3].",
              "As such, competition among and between males for access to receptive females can be high.",
              "Females are philopatric and typically remain in semi-stable natal groups with female relatives and their offspring [4,5], and males disperse in early adulthood to form fewer permanent all-male groups or to move solitarily [6,7,8].",
              "Therefore, to gain access to estrous females, male elephants announce their intent to reproduce through musth.",
              "Musth is a reproductive condition that occurs regularly but asynchronously among males [9,10], and it is initiated by a surge in serum androgens that induce a suite of behavioral and physiological changes [11,12,13,14,15].",
              "Musth is also characterized by various signals of multiple sensory modalities (chemical, visual, and/or acoustic components) that apparently promote inter- and intrasexual social interactions [16].",
              "While the social correlates and consequences of musth in African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) have been well-described [17,18], there is still much to be learned about musth and social behavior in Asian elephants.",
              "Further, understanding species-specific drivers of reproduction (i.",
              "e., sexual selection and social behavior) is critical for the management of healthy, sustainable in-situ and ex-situ wildlife populations [19,20].",
              "Musth in Asian elephants functions as a sexually selected signal to facilitate female mate choice (intersexual selection) and mediate male\u2013male competition (intrasexual selection) [16].",
              "Recent evidence suggests that musth serves as a roving strategy by which males traverse large areas in search of estrous females, broadcasting their sexual status to potential mates [21,22].",
              "Female elephants appear to be more receptive to musth males [1,21];",
              "in turn, these males should secure more mating opportunities, thus increasing their fitness over that of non-musth males.",
              "Other factors not necessarily related to musth status may also impact female preference, including age [17].",
              "Indeed, female elephants appear to prefer to associate with older males [1,21], who are also larger because male elephants continue to grow throughout their lives [23,24].",
              "By better characterizing the changes in the social behavior of male Asian elephants, we can more confidently identify factors like age and musth status that contribute to intersexual selection and female mate choice.",
              "Still, in polygynous species like Asian elephants, a male\u2019s mating success can also be influenced by factors other than female choice, such as male dominance and competitive ability relative to other male conspecifics.",
              "Although younger male elephants are virtually always subordinate to older males [2], musth status seems to outweigh age-based dominance hierarchies [25,26,27], diffusing combative and potentially costly interactions between males.",
