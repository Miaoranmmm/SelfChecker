              "[12] Between these two phases, stars spend a period on the horizontal branch with a helium-fusing core.",
              "Many of these helium-fusing stars cluster towards the cool end of the horizontal branch as K-type giants and are referred to as red clump giants.",
              "When a star exhausts the hydrogen in its core, it leaves the main sequence and begins to fuse hydrogen in a shell outside the core.",
              "The core increases in mass as the shell produces more helium.",
              "Depending on the mass of the helium core, this continues for several million to one or two billion years, with the star expanding and cooling at a similar or slightly lower luminosity to its main sequence state.",
              "Eventually either the core becomes degenerate, in stars around the mass of the sun, or the outer layers cool sufficiently to become opaque, in more massive stars.",
              "Either of these changes cause the hydrogen shell to increase in temperature and the luminosity of the star to increase, at which point the star expands onto the red-giant branch.",
              "[13] The expanding outer layers of the star are convective, with the material being mixed by turbulence from near the fusing regions up to the surface of the star.",
              "For all but the lowest-mass stars, the fused material has remained deep in the stellar interior prior to this point, so the convecting envelope makes fusion products visible at the star's surface for the first time.",
              "At this stage of evolution, the results are subtle, with the largest effects, alterations to the isotopes of hydrogen and helium, being unobservable.",
              "The effects of the CNO cycle appear at the surface during the first dredge-up, with lower 12C/13C ratios and altered proportions of carbon and nitrogen.",
              "These are detectable with spectroscopy and have been measured for many evolved stars.",
              "The helium core continues to grow on the red-giant branch.",
              "It is no longer in thermal equilibrium, either degenerate or above the Scho\u0308nberg\u2013Chandrasekhar limit, so it increases in temperature which causes the rate of fusion in the hydrogen shell to increase.",
              "The star increases in luminosity towards the tip of the red-giant branch.",
              "Red-giant-branch stars with a degenerate helium core all reach the tip with very similar core masses and very similar luminosities, although the more massive of the red giants become hot enough to ignite helium fusion before that point.",

              "In the nondegenerate cores of more massive stars, the ignition of helium fusion occurs relatively slowly with no flash.",
              "[14] The nuclear power released during the helium flash is very large, on the order of 108 times the luminosity of the Sun for a few days[13] and 1011 times the luminosity of the Sun (roughly the luminosity of the Milky Way Galaxy) for a few seconds.",
              "[15] However, the energy is consumed by the thermal expansion of the initially degenerate core and thus cannot be seen from outside the star.",
              "[13][15][16] Due to the expansion of the core, the hydrogen fusion in the overlying layers slows and total energy generation decreases.",
              "The star contracts, although not all the way to the main sequence, and it migrates to the horizontal branch on the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram, gradually shrinking in radius and increasing its surface temperature.",
              "Core helium flash stars evolve to the red end of the horizontal branch but do not migrate to higher temperatures before they gain a degenerate carbon-oxygen core and start helium shell burning.",
              "These stars are often observed as a red clump of stars in the colour-magnitude diagram of a cluster, hotter and less luminous than the red giants.",
              "Higher-mass stars with larger helium cores move along the horizontal branch to higher temperatures, some becoming unstable pulsating stars in the yellow instability strip (RR Lyrae variables), whereas some become even hotter and can form a blue tail or blue hook to the horizontal branch.",
              "The morphology of the horizontal branch depends on parameters such as metallicity, age, and helium content, but the exact details are still being modelled.",
              "[17] After a star has consumed the helium at the core, hydrogen and helium fusion continues in shells around a hot core of carbon and oxygen.",
              "The star follows the asymptotic giant branch on the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram, paralleling the original red-giant evolution, but with even faster energy generation (which lasts for a shorter time).",
              "[18] Although helium is being burnt in a shell, the majority of the energy is produced by hydrogen burning in a shell further from the core of the star.",
              "Helium from these hydrogen burning shells drops towards the center of the star and periodically the energy output from the helium shell increases dramatically.",
              "This is known as a thermal pulse and they occur towards the end of the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, sometimes even into the post-asymptotic-giant-branch phase.",
              "Depending on mass and composition, there may be several to hundreds of thermal pulses.",
              "There is a phase on the ascent of the asymptotic-giant-branch where a deep convective zone forms and can bring carbon from the core to the surface.",
              "This is known as the second dredge up, and in some stars there may even be a third dredge up.",
              "In this way a carbon star is formed, very cool and strongly reddened stars showing strong carbon lines in their spectra.",
              "A process known as hot bottom burning may convert carbon into oxygen and nitrogen before it can be dredged to the surface, and the interaction between these processes determines the observed luminosities and spectra of carbon stars in particular clusters.",
              "[19] Another well known class of asymptotic-giant-branch stars is the Mira variables, which pulsate with well-defined periods of tens to hundreds of days and large amplitudes up to about 10 magnitudes (in the visual, total luminosity changes by a much smaller amount).",
              "In more-massive stars the stars become more luminous and the pulsation period is longer, leading to enhanced mass loss, and the stars become heavily obscured at visual wavelengths.",
              "These stars can be observed as OH/IR stars, pulsating in the infrared and showing OH maser activity.",
              "These stars are clearly oxygen rich, in contrast to the carbon stars, but both must be produced by dredge ups.",
              "These mid-range stars ultimately reach the tip of the asymptotic-giant-branch and run out of fuel for shell burning.",
              "They are not sufficiently massive to start full-scale carbon fusion, so they contract again, going through a period of post-asymptotic-giant-branch superwind to produce a planetary nebula with an extremely hot central star.",
              "The central star then cools to a white dwarf.",
              "The expelled gas is relatively rich in heavy elements created within the star and may be particularly oxygen or carbon enriched, depending on the type of the star.",
              "The gas builds up in an expanding shell called a circumstellar envelope and cools as it moves away from the star, allowing dust particles and molecules to form.",
              "With the high infrared energy input from the central star, ideal conditions are formed in these circumstellar envelopes for maser excitation.",
              "It is possible for thermal pulses to be produced once post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution has begun, producing a variety of unusual and poorly understood stars known as born-again asymptotic-giant-branch stars.",
              "[20] These may result in extreme horizontal-branch stars (subdwarf B stars), hydrogen deficient post-asymptotic-giant-branch stars, variable planetary nebula central stars, and R Coronae Borealis variables.",
              "In massive stars, the core is already large enough at the onset of the hydrogen burning shell that helium ignition will occur before electron degeneracy pressure has a chance to become prevalent.",
              "Thus, when these stars expand and cool, they do not brighten as dramatically as lower-mass stars;",
              "however, they were more luminous on the main sequence and they evolve to highly luminous supergiants.",
              "Their cores become massive enough that they cannot support themselves by electron degeneracy and will eventually collapse to produce a neutron star or black hole.",
              "[citation needed] Extremely massive stars (more than approximately 40 M\u2609), which are very luminous and thus have very rapid stellar winds, lose mass so rapidly due to radiation pressure that they tend to strip off their own envelopes before they can expand to become red supergiants, and thus retain extremely high surface temperatures (and blue-white color) from their main-sequence time onwards.",
              "The largest stars of the current generation are about 100-150 M\u2609 because the outer layers would be expelled by the extreme radiation.",
              "Although lower-mass stars normally do not burn off their outer layers so rapidly, they can likewise avoid becoming red giants or red supergiants if they are in binary systems close enough so that the companion star strips off the envelope as it expands, or if they rotate rapidly enough so that convection extends all the way from the core to the surface, resulting in the absence of a separate core and envelope due to thorough mixing.",
              "[21] The core of a massive star, defined as the region depleted of hydrogen, grows hotter and denser as it accretes material from the fusion of hydrogen outside the core.",
              "In sufficiently massive stars, the core reaches temperatures and densities high enough to fuse carbon and heavier elements via the alpha process.",
              "At the end of helium fusion, the core of a star consists primarily of carbon and oxygen.",
              "In stars heavier than about 8 M\u2609, the carbon ignites and fuses to form neon, sodium, and magnesium.",
              "Stars somewhat less massive may partially ignite carbon, but they are unable to fully fuse the carbon before electron degeneracy sets in, and these stars will eventually leave an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.",
              "[22][23] The exact mass limit for full carbon burning depends on several factors such as metallicity and the detailed mass lost on the asymptotic giant branch, but is approximately 8-9 M\u2609.",
              "[22] After carbon burning is complete, the core of these stars reaches about 2.",
              "5 M\u2609 and becomes hot enough for heavier elements to fuse.",
              "Before oxygen starts to fuse, neon begins to capture electrons which triggers neon burning.",
              "For a range of stars of approximately 8-12 M\u2609, this process is unstable and creates runaway fusion resulting in an electron capture supernova.",
              "[24][23] In more massive stars, the fusion of neon proceeds without a runaway deflagration.",
              "This is followed in turn by complete oxygen burning and silicon burning, producing a core consisting largely of iron-peak elements.",
              "Surrounding the core are shells of lighter elements still undergoing fusion.",
              "The timescale for complete fusion of a carbon core to an iron core is so short, just a few hundred years, that the outer layers of the star are unable to react and the appearance of the star is largely unchanged.",
              "The iron core grows until it reaches an effective Chandrasekhar mass, higher than the formal Chandrasekhar mass due to various corrections for the relativistic effects, entropy, charge, and the surrounding envelope.",

              "[23] When the core of a massive star collapses, it will form a neutron star, or in the case of cores that exceed the Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit, a black hole.",
