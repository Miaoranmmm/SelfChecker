    "response": "The creation of the periodic table was a gradual process that involved many scientists over almost a century. The periodic table is a way of organizing the elements based on their atomic number, chemical properties and physical properties. It is a very useful tool for modern science and chemistry because it helps to predict how elements will react with each other, understand the trends in their properties and discover new elements.\n\nSome of the key figures in the history of the periodic table are:\n\n- **Antoine Lavoisier** (1743-1794), a French chemist who tried to group the elements as metals and nonmetals[^1^].\n- **Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner** (1780-1849), a German physicist who observed similarities among certain elements and arranged them in groups of three called triads[^1^].\n- **John Newlands** (1837-1898), a British chemist who was the first to arrange the elements in increasing order of atomic mass and found that every eighth element had similar properties. He called this the law of octaves[^2^].\n- **Dmitri Mendeleev** (1834-1907), a Russian chemist who created the framework of the modern periodic table by leaving gaps for undiscovered elements and predicting their properties. He also rearranged some elements based on their chemical properties rather than their atomic mass[^2^] [^3^].\n- **Lothar Meyer** (1830-1895), a German chemist who produced a version of the periodic table similar to Mendeleev's but did not predict the properties of undiscovered elements[^1^].\n- **William Ramsay** (1852-1916), a British chemist who discovered the noble gases and added them to the periodic table[^2^].\n- **Henry Moseley** (1887-1915), a British physicist who discovered that each element has a unique atomic number and rearranged the periodic table based on that instead of atomic mass[^2^].\n\nThe periodic table has had a huge impact on modern science and chemistry because it reveals the underlying patterns and relationships among the elements. It also helps to explain phenomena such as radioactivity, chemical bonding, molecular structure, periodic trends and chemical reactions.

              "[86][87][88][89] The first-row anomaly in the periodic table is cited in support of this reassignment, since helium as the first s-block element before the alkaline earth metals stands out as anomalous in a way that helium as the first noble gas does not.",

              "The periodic table has gone through many changes since Dmitri Mendeleev drew up its original design in 1869, yet both the first table and the modern periodic table are important for the same reason: The periodic table organizes elements according to similar properties so you can tell the characteristics of an element just by looking at its location on the table.",
              "Before all naturally occurring elements were discovered, the periodic table was used to predict the chemical and physical properties of elements in the gaps on the table.",
              "Today, the table can be used to predict properties of elements yet to be discovered, although these new elements are all highly radioactive and break down into more familiar elements almost instantly.",
              "Now, the table is useful for modern students and scientists because it helps predict the types of chemical reactions that a particular element is likely to participate in.",
              "Rather than memorizing facts and figures for each element, students and scientists need only glance at the table to learn much about the reactivity of an element, whether it is likely to conduct electricity, whether it is hard or soft, and many other characteristics.",
              "Elements in the same column as one other are known as groups and they share similar properties.",
              "For example, the elements in the first column (the alkali metals) are all metals that usually carry a 1+ charge in reactions, react vigorously with water, and combine readily with nonmetals.",
              "Elements in the same row as one other are known as periods and they share the same highest unexcited electron energy level.",
              "Another useful feature of the periodic table is that most tables provide all the information you need to balance chemical reactions at a glance.",
              "The table tells each element's atomic number and usually its atomic weight.",
              "The typical charge of an element is indicated by its group.",
              "The periodic table is organized according to trends in element properties.",
              "As you move from left to right across a row of elements, the atomic radius (the size of an element's atoms) decreases, ionization energy (the energy required to remove an electron from an atom) increases, electron affinity (the amount of energy released when an atom forms a negative ion) generally increases, and electronegativity (an atom's tendency to attract a pair of electrons) increases.",
              "As you move from top to bottom down a column of elements, the atomic radius increases, ionization energy decreases, electron affinity usually decreases, and electronegativity decreases.",
              "To summarize, the periodic table is important because it is organized to provide a great deal of information about elements and how they relate to one another in one easy-to-use reference.",

              "Alexandre Be\u0301guyer de Chancourtois was a geologist, but this was at a time when scientists specialised much less than they do today.",
              "His principal contribution to chemistry was the 'vis tellurique' (telluric screw), a three-dimensional arrangement of the elements constituting an early form of the periodic classification, published in 1862.",
              "The telluric screw plotted the atomic weights of the elements on the outside of a cylinder, so that one complete turn corresponded to an atomic weight increase of 16.",
              "As the diagram shows, this arrangement means that certain elements with similar properties appear in a vertical line.",
              "Although the telluric screw did not correctly display all the trends that were known at the time, de Chancourtois was the first to use a periodic arrangement of all of the known elements, showing that similar elements appear at periodic atom weights.",

              "John Newlands was British;",
              "his father was a Scottish Presbyterian minister.",
              "He was educated by his father at home, and then studied for a year (1856) at the Royal College of Chemistry, which is now part of Imperial College London.",
              "Later he worked at an agricultural college trying to find patterns of behaviour in organic chemistry.",
              "However, he is remembered for his search for a pattern in inorganic chemistry.",
              "Just four years before Mendeleev announced his periodic table, Newlands noticed that there were similarities between elements with atomic weights that differed by seven.",
              "He called this The Law of Octaves, drawing a comparison with the octaves of music.",
              "The noble gases (Helium, Neon, Argon etc.)",
              "were not discovered until much later, which explains why there was a periodicity of 7 and not 8 in Newlands table.",
              "Newlands did not leave any gaps for undiscovered elements in his table, and sometimes had to cram two elements into one box in order to keep the pattern.",
              "Because of this, the Chemical Society refused to publish his paper, with one Professor Foster saying he might have equally well listed the elements alphabetically.",
              "Even when Mendeleev had published his table, and Newlands claimed to have discovered it first, the Chemical Society would not back him up.",
              "In 1884 he was asked to give a lecture of the Periodic Law by the Society, which went some way towards making amends.",
              "Finally, in 1998 the Royal Society of Chemistry oversaw the placing a blue commemorative plaque on the wall of his birthplace, recognising his discovery at last.",
              "The blue commemorative plaque placed at Newlands\u2019 birthplace, declaring him the \u201cdiscoverer of the Periodic Law for the chemical elements\u201d.",
              "Meyer trained at Heidelberg University under Bunsen and Kirchhoff, as did Mendeleev.",
              "So the two scientists would certainly have known each other although neither was aware of all the work done by the other.",
              "Meyer's roots, however, were firmly in Germany.",
              "Meyer was just four years older than Mendeleev, and produced several Periodic Tables between 1864-1870.",
              "His first table contained just 28 elements, organised by their valency (how many other atoms they can combine with).",
              "These elements were almost entirely main group elements, but in 1868 he incorporated the transition metals in a much more developed table.",
              "This 1868 table listed the elements in order of atomic weight, with elements with the same valency arranged in vertical lines, strikingly similar to Mendeleev\u2019s table.",
              "Unfortunately for Meyer, his work wasn\u2019t published until 1870, a year after Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table had been published.",
              "Even after 1870, Meyer and Mendeleev were still unaware of each other\u2019s work, although Meyer later admitted that Mendeleev had published his version first.",
              "Meyer did contribute to the development of the periodic table in another way though.",
              "He was the first person to recognise the periodic trends in the properties of elements, and the graph shows the pattern he saw in the atomic volume of an element plotted against its atomic weight.",
              "A modern version of Meyer\u2019s graph demonstrating the periodic trends in the atomic volume of the elements, plotted against atomic weight.",
              "As we have seen, Mendeleev was not the first to attempt to find order within the elements, but it is his attempt that was so successful that it now forms the basis of the modern periodic table.",
              "Mendeleev did not have the easiest of starts in life.",
              "He was born at Tobolsk in 1834, the youngest child of a large Siberian family.",
              "His father died while he was young, and so his mother moved the family 1500 km to St.",
              "Petersburg, where she managed to get Dmitri into a \u201cgood school\u201c, recognising his potential.",
              "In his adult life he was a brilliant scientist, rising quickly in academic circles.",
              "He wrote a textbook, Chemical Principles, because he couldn\u2019t find an adequate Russian book.",
              "Mendeleev discovered the periodic table (or Periodic System, as he called it) while attempting to organise the elements in February of 1869.",
              "He did so by writing the properties of the elements on pieces of card and arranging and rearranging them until he realised that, by putting them in order of increasing atomic weight, certain types of element regularly occurred.",
              "For example, a reactive non-metal was directly followed by a very reactive light metal and then a less reactive light metal.",
              "Initially, the table had similar elements in horizontal rows, but he soon changed them to fit in vertical columns, as we see today.",
              "Not only did Mendeleev arrange the elements in the correct way, but if an element appeared to be in the wrong place due to its atomic weight, he moved it to where it fitted with the pattern he had discovered.",
              "For example, iodine and tellurium should be the other way around, based on atomic weights, but Mendeleev saw that iodine was very similar to the rest of the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine), and tellurium similar to the group 6 elements (oxygen, sulphur, selenium), so he swapped them over.",
              "The real genius of Mendeleev\u2019s achievement was to leave gaps for undiscovered elements.",
              "He even predicted the properties of five of these elements and their compounds.",
              "And over the next 15 years, three of these elements were discovered and Mendeleev\u2019s predictions shown to be incredibly accurate.",
              "The table below shows the example of Gallium, which Mendeleev called eka-aluminium, because it was the element after aluminium.",
              "Scandium and Germanium were the other two elements discovered by 1886, and helped to cement the reputation of Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table.",
              "The final triumph of Mendeleev\u2019s work was slightly unexpected.",
              "The discovery of the noble gases during the 1890s by William Ramsay initially seemed to contradict Mendeleev\u2019s work, until he realised that actually they were further proof of his system, fitting in as the final group on his table.",
              "This gave the table the periodicity of 8 which we know, rather than 7 as it had previously been.",
              "Mendeleev never received a Nobel Prize for his work, but element 101 was named Mendelevium after him, an even rarer distinction.",

              "The periodic table was arranged by atomic mass, and this nearly always gives the same order as the atomic number.",
              "However, there were some exceptions (like iodine and tellurium, see above), which didn\u2019t work.",
              "Mendeleev had seen that they needed to be swapped around, but it was Moseley that finally determined why.",
              "He fired the newly-developed X-ray gun at samples of the elements, and measured the wavelength of X-rays given.",
              "He used this to calculate the frequency and found that when the square root of this frequency was plotted against atomic number, the graph showed a perfect straight line.",
              "He\u2019d found a way to actually measure atomic number.",
              "When the First World War broke out, Moseley turned down a position as a professor at Oxford and became an officer in the Royal Engineers.",
              "He was killed by a sniper in Turkey in August 15, and many people think that Britain lost a future Nobel prize winner.",
              "Within 10 years of his work, the structure of the atom had been determined through the work of many prominent scientists of the day, and this explained further why Moseley\u2019s X-rays corresponded so well with atomic number.",
              "The idea behind the explanation is that when an electron falls from a higher energy level to a lower one, the energy is released as electromagnetic waves, in this case X-rays.",
              "The amount of energy that is given out depends on how strongly the electrons are attracted to the nucleus.",
              "The more protons an atom has in its nucleus, the more strongly the electrons will be attracted and the more energy will be given out.",
              "As we know, atomic number is also known as proton number, and it is the amount of protons that determine the energy of the X-rays.",
              "After years of searching, at last we had a periodic table that really worked, and the fact that we still use it today is testament to the huge achievement of these and many other great minds of the last two centuries of scientific discovery."

              "In 1869, Mendeleev published his vision in an early form of the periodic table.",
              "It included the 63 elements that were known at the time, with holes to account for elements that hadn\u2019t yet been discovered.",

              "You don\u2019t yet know about protons and therefore atomic numbers, which, for the most part, conveniently run in order from one to 118 from left to right and top to bottom of the table.",
              "All you know about the elements identified at the time is how they interact with each other, their physical properties, and their relative atomic weights.",
              "And you want to categorize them.",
              "Before Mendeleev came along with his approach, other scientists were attempting to organize the elements.",
              "As early as 1789, French chemist Antoine Lavoisier had categorized elements into metals, nonmetals, \u201cearths,\u201d and gases, based on their physical and chemical characteristics.",
              "By 1829, German chemist Johann Do\u0308bereiner had noticed patterns among triplets of elements.",
              "In 1865, British chemist John Newlands noticed the periodicity of chemical properties and likened the phenomenon to musical octaves, in which the same tone repeats after an increase or decrease of eight notes.",
              "In Germany, chemist Julius Lothar Meyer was developing his own periodic table that was published in 1870.",
              "But Mendeleev beat Meyer to the punch a year earlier.",
              "What sort of chemical properties did Mendeleev have in mind when he developed his table?",
              "To get a better idea of the patterns he noticed, let\u2019s start with the metal lithium (Li).",
              "Mendeleev knew the hydride\u2014a compound of hydrogen with another element\u2014that Li formed had the formula LiH.",
              "2 Li(s) + H2(g) \u2192 2 LiH(s) In contrast, the next element by weight, beryllium (Be), formed the hydride BeH2.",
              "Be(s) + H2(g) \u2192BeH2(s) Each successively heavier element formed different kinds of hydrides until he got to sodium (Na).",
              "Sodium behaved like lithium in its reactions with hydrogen, forming NaH.",
              "2 Na(s) + H2(g) \u2192 2 NaH(s) Thus, a pattern started to emerge.",
              "But Mendeleev\u2019s most insightful decision was to let properties sometimes trump atomic weight when he placed elements.",
              "For example, if you look at the periodic table, you\u2019ll notice that nickel follows cobalt in the fourth row even though nickel is lighter.",
              "Mendeleev placed them this way because nickel\u2019s properties aligned with palladium\u2019s (on the next row, same column) and cobalt\u2019s with rhodium.",
              "This approach allowed him to skip slots in the table that corresponded to chemical properties and atomic mass ranges that did not match any elements known at the time.",
              "For each open slot, Mendeleev predicted the existence of a yet-to-be discovered element.",
              "He turned out to be right most of the time.",
              "For example, Mendeleev had left spaces for yet-to-be discovered elements that he called eka-aluminum, eka-manganese, and eka-silicon\u2014eka is the Sanskrit word for \u201cone.",
              "\u201d These spots were ultimately taken by gallium, technetium, and germanium.",
              "That\u2019s not to say Mendeleev\u2019s table was perfect from the beginning, or even the only way to organize elements.",
              "He himself revised it within two years of introducing it.",
              "Mendeleev\u2019s 1869 periodic table had the elements with increasing mass moving down in columns, while elements with similar chemical properties lined up horizontally in rows.",
              "In 1871, however, he reversed this idea.",
              "He lined up elements with similar properties vertically, and the periods appeared in horizontal rows.",
              "It wasn\u2019t until more than 40 years later in 1913 that British physicist Henry Moseley used a technique called X-ray spectroscopy to count the numbers of positive charges in the atomic nucleus.",
              "Moseley then developed the first modern periodic table, basing the element sequence directly on these charges.",
              "In 1920, New Zealand-born British physicist Ernest Rutherford identified the charge as the atomic number, or the proton number.",
              "Remarkably, organizing the table this way validated Mendeleev\u2019s original approach.",
              "Additional findings further fleshed out the table.",
              "By this point, for instance, noble gases had been discovered.",
              "Initially, they were placed to the left of group 1 metals.",
              "But further study justified moving them to the far-right side of the table where they reside now.",
              "Also, beginning with period 4, which starts with potassium (K), the table expanded like an accordion to hold 10 additional groups.",
              "The addition of these transition elements gave the table a shape more like you see in today\u2019s version.",
              "And what about the two rows that sit below the main table?",
              "These are the lanthanide and actinide series.",
              "The first elements in these rows were discovered as early as the 1700s, but they weren\u2019t organized in their own section until the 1900s.",
              "Although they look separate from the rest of the table, they really belong to periods 6 and 7, respectively, and in between groups 2 and 3.",
              "We often see hydrogen atop group 1 although hydrogen is very different from the other elements in the column.",

              "Development of the periodic table",
              "Can France claim the first periodic table?",
              "Probably not, but a French Geology Professor made a significant advance towards it, even though at the time few people were aware of it.",
              "Alexandre Be\u0301guyer de Chancourtois was a geologist, but this was at a time when scientists specialised much less than they do today.",
              "His principal contribution to chemistry was the 'vis tellurique' (telluric screw), a three-dimensional arrangement of the elements constituting an early form of the periodic classification, published in 1862.",
              "The telluric screw plotted the atomic weights of the elements on the outside of a cylinder, so that one complete turn corresponded to an atomic weight increase of 16.",
              "As the diagram shows, this arrangement means that certain elements with similar properties appear in a vertical line.",
              "Although the telluric screw did not correctly display all the trends that were known at the time, de Chancourtois was the first to use a periodic arrangement of all of the known elements, showing that similar elements appear at periodic atom weights.",
              "The vis tellurique from De Chancourtois\u2019s original publication (right) and a copy drawn out with modern symbols (left).",
              "John Newlands was British;",
              "his father was a Scottish Presbyterian minister.",
              "He was educated by his father at home, and then studied for a year (1856) at the Royal College of Chemistry, which is now part of Imperial College London.",
              "Later he worked at an agricultural college trying to find patterns of behaviour in organic chemistry.",
              "However, he is remembered for his search for a pattern in inorganic chemistry.",
              "Just four years before Mendeleev announced his periodic table, Newlands noticed that there were similarities between elements with atomic weights that differed by seven.",
              "He called this The Law of Octaves, drawing a comparison with the octaves of music.",
              "The noble gases (Helium, Neon, Argon etc.)",
              "were not discovered until much later, which explains why there was a periodicity of 7 and not 8 in Newlands table.",
              "Newlands did not leave any gaps for undiscovered elements in his table, and sometimes had to cram two elements into one box in order to keep the pattern.",
              "Because of this, the Chemical Society refused to publish his paper, with one Professor Foster saying he might have equally well listed the elements alphabetically.",
              "Even when Mendeleev had published his table, and Newlands claimed to have discovered it first, the Chemical Society would not back him up.",
              "In 1884 he was asked to give a lecture of the Periodic Law by the Society, which went some way towards making amends.",
              "Finally, in 1998 the Royal Society of Chemistry oversaw the placing a blue commemorative plaque on the wall of his birthplace, recognising his discovery at last.",
              "The blue commemorative plaque placed at Newlands\u2019 birthplace, declaring him the \u201cdiscoverer of the Periodic Law for the chemical elements\u201d.",
              "Meyer trained at Heidelberg University under Bunsen and Kirchhoff, as did Mendeleev.",
              "So the two scientists would certainly have known each other although neither was aware of all the work done by the other.",
              "Meyer's roots, however, were firmly in Germany.",
              "Meyer was just four years older than Mendeleev, and produced several Periodic Tables between 1864-1870.",
              "His first table contained just 28 elements, organised by their valency (how many other atoms they can combine with).",
              "These elements were almost entirely main group elements, but in 1868 he incorporated the transition metals in a much more developed table.",
              "This 1868 table listed the elements in order of atomic weight, with elements with the same valency arranged in vertical lines, strikingly similar to Mendeleev\u2019s table.",
              "Unfortunately for Meyer, his work wasn\u2019t published until 1870, a year after Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table had been published.",
              "Even after 1870, Meyer and Mendeleev were still unaware of each other\u2019s work, although Meyer later admitted that Mendeleev had published his version first.",
              "Meyer did contribute to the development of the periodic table in another way though.",
              "He was the first person to recognise the periodic trends in the properties of elements, and the graph shows the pattern he saw in the atomic volume of an element plotted against its atomic weight.",

              "Who really created the periodic table?",
              "Dmitri Mendeleev typically gets credit, but Julius Lothar Meyer has a compelling case on his side.",
              "Renowned chemist Eric Scerri gives us his verdict.",
              "The year 2019 marked the official 150th anniversary of the discovery of the periodic table.",
              "Many international conferences, special issues of journals, and entire volumes were dedicated to celebrating this event.",
              "However, it was actually 150 years after just one of the discoverers.",
              "Dmitri Mendeleev is typically credited with the discovery of the periodic table, but when he published his table, as many as 5 other authors in different countries had already published their own periodic tables, including one Lothar Meyer who had published several tables over a period of seven years.",
              "What I would like to propose that Meyer deserves as much, if not even more, credit than Mendeleev.",
              "To put the matter simply, Meyer discovered the most mature of the 5 earlier periodic systems and had the most advanced scientific views, while Mendeleev was the most adept at applying the periodic table to making predictions of as yet undiscovered elements, three of which were found within a period of 15 years.",
              "Meanwhile Meyer was rather more cautious in that he only made one specific prediction, of an element that became known as germanium when it was later discovered.",
              "Meyer also claimed that it was imprudent to assume that the atomic weights of certain elements had been incorrectly determined just because it might be convenient to do so.",
              "For example, both chemists reversed the positions of the elements tellurium and iodine in their periodic tables, as indeed some even earlier discoverers had done.",
              "Whereas their measured atomic weights suggested that iodine should be placed before tellurium, doing so would have put both elements in the wrong columns of the periodic table in terms of their chemical properties.",
              "However, with his characteristic boldness Mendeleev claimed that the atomic weights of one or both of these elements had been incorrectly determined.",
              "It turned out that Mendeleev was quite wrong on this point even though he clung to his view for the rest of his life.",
              "About forty years later it was found that a more correct ordering criterion for the elements is atomic number rather than weight.",
              "Only then did the true justification for reversing the elements become available.",
              "Up to that point the reversal had been something of an ad hoc move, specifically intended to agree with the chemical behavior of these two elements.",
              "Lothar Meyera\u0302\u0080\u0099s first tables were published in 1864, well before Mendeleeva\u0302\u0080\u0099s now famous version of 1869.",
              "Mendeleeva\u0302\u0080\u0099s scientific views were rather conservative in that he did not believe in the existence of atoms or electrons and nor did he think that radioactivity was important when it was first discovered.",
              "He also refused to accept Prouta\u0302\u0080\u0099s hypothesis (William Prout ), that all atoms were composites of the hydrogen atom, because he was suspicious of the notion that all matter was essentially the same.",
              "In almost each of these issues Meyer disagreed and it turned out that Meyera\u0302\u0080\u0099s views prevailed and were later supported by further evidence.",
              "The reason why we seem to celebrate Mendeleeva\u0302\u0080\u0099s achievements more than those of Meyer seems to be partly due to the determined manner in which Mendeleev applied the periodic table to correct some atomic weights and to successfully predict the existence of new elements.",
              "He was also more vociferous and forceful than Meyer when it came to the protracted debate that took place between the two chemists.",
              "Furthermore, Mendeleev published his ideas at a time when the Russian chemical society was just getting started and was encouraging the submission of speculative articles for its journal.",
              "Meyer was working within a far more established German Chemical Society which discouraged speculative ideas and demanded more caution.",
              "To return to my earlier point, I claim that the discovery of the periodic table belongs to Meyer and even the earlier four chemists, while its exploitation and application was carried out most successfully by Mendeleev.",
              "What was Mendeleev doing in 1864 when Meyer published his first rudimentary periodic tables?",
              "It turns out he was still in the process of obtaining his doctorate and had not thought very much about classifying the elements as far as we know.",
              "So why is it generally believed that Mendeleev alone discovered the periodic table and why is he ranked above Meyer in the popular imagination?",
              "Perhaps the work of Meyer should finally be carefully re-examined and rehabilitated?",

              "One of the first to suggest such an arrangement was the German chemist Johannes Dobereiner (1780\u20131849), who noticed that many of the known elements could be grouped in triads (a set of three elements that have similar properties)\u2014for example, chlorine, bromine, and iodine;",
              "or copper, silver, and gold.",
              "Dobereiner proposed that all elements could be grouped in such triads, but subsequent attempts to expand his concept were unsuccessful.",
              "We now know that portions of the periodic table\u2014the d block in particular\u2014contain triads of elements with substantial similarities.",
              "The middle three members of most of the other columns, such as sulfur, selenium, and tellurium in group 16 or aluminum, gallium, and indium in Group 13, also have remarkably similar chemistry.",
              "By the mid-19th century, the atomic masses of many of the elements had been determined.",
              "The English chemist John Newlands (1838\u20131898), hypothesizing that the chemistry of the elements might be related to their masses, arranged the known elements in order of increasing atomic mass and discovered that every seventh element had similar properties (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)).",
              "Newlands therefore suggested that the elements could be classified into octaves.",
              "He described octaves as a group of seven elements which correspond to the horizontal rows in the main groups of today's periodic table.",
              "There were seven elements because the noble gases were not known at the time.",
              "Unfortunately, Newlands\u2019s \u201claw of octaves\u201d did not seem to work for elements heavier than calcium, and his idea was publicly ridiculed.",
              "At one scientific meeting, Newlands was asked why he didn\u2019t arrange the elements in alphabetical order instead of by atomic mass, since that would make just as much sense!",
              "Actually, Newlands was on the right track\u2014with only a few exceptions, atomic mass does increase with atomic number, and similar properties occur every time a set of ns2np6 subshells is filled.",
              "Despite the fact that Newlands\u2019s table had no logical place for the d-block elements, he was honored for his idea by the Royal Society of London in 1887.",
              "John Newlands (1838\u20131898) John Alexander Reina Newlands was an English chemist who worked on the development of the periodic table.",
              "He noticed that elemental properties repeated every seventh (or multiple of seven) element, as musical notes repeat every eighth note.",
              "The periodic table achieved its modern form through the work of the German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer (1830\u20131895) and the Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev (1834\u20131907), both of whom focused on the relationships between atomic mass and various physical and chemical properties.",
              "In 1869, they independently proposed essentially identical arrangements of the elements.",
              "Meyer aligned the elements in his table according to periodic variations in simple atomic properties, such as \u201catomic volume\u201d (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{2}\\)), which he obtained by dividing the atomic mass (molar mass) in grams per mole by the density (\\(\\rho\\)) of the element in grams per cubic centimeter.",

              "In Meyer\u2019s plot of atomic volume versus atomic mass, the nonmetals occur on the rising portion of the graph, and metals occur at the peaks, in the valleys, and on the downslopes.",
              "Dimitri Mendeleev (1834\u20131907) When his family\u2019s glass factory was destroyed by fire, Mendeleev moved to St.",

              "He became ill and was not expected to recover, but he finished his PhD with the help of his professors and fellow students.",
              "In addition to the periodic table, another of Mendeleev\u2019s contributions to science was an outstanding textbook, The Principles of Chemistry, which was used for many years.",
              "Mendeleev, who first published his periodic table in 1869 (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{3}\\)), is usually credited with the origin of the modern periodic table.",
              "The key difference between his arrangement of the elements and that of Meyer and others is that Mendeleev did not assume that all the elements had been discovered (actually, only about two-thirds of the naturally occurring elements were known at the time).",
              "Instead, he deliberately left blanks in his table at atomic masses 44, 68, 72, and 100, in the expectation that elements with those atomic masses would be discovered.",
              "Those blanks correspond to the elements we now know as scandium, gallium, germanium, and technetium.",
              "The groups in Mendeleev's table are determined by how many oxygen or hydrogen atoms are needed to form compounds with each element.",
              "For example, in Group I, two atoms of hydrogen, lithium, Li, sodium, Na, and potassium form compounds with one atom of oxygen.",
              "In Group VII, one atom of fluorine, F, chlorine, Cl, and bromine, Br, react with one atom of hydrogen.",
              "Notice how this approach has trouble with the transition metals.",
              "Until roughly 1960, a rectangular table developed from Mendeleev's table and based on reactivity was standard at the front of chemistry lecture halls.",
              "The most convincing evidence in support of Mendeleev\u2019s arrangement of the elements was the discovery of two previously unknown elements whose properties closely corresponded with his predictions (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)).",
              "Two of the blanks Mendeleev had left in his original table were below aluminum and silicon, awaiting the discovery of two as-yet-unknown elements, eka-aluminum and eka-silicon (from the Sanskrit eka, meaning \u201cone,\u201d as in \u201cone beyond aluminum\u201d).",
              "The observed properties of gallium and germanium matched those of eka-aluminum and eka-silicon so well that once they were discovered, Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table rapidly gained acceptance.",
              "When the chemical properties of an element suggested that it might have been assigned the wrong place in earlier tables, Mendeleev carefully reexamined its atomic mass.",

              "[7][8][a] Moseley had been a very promising schoolboy at Summer Fields School (where one of the four \"leagues\" is named after him), and he was awarded a King's scholarship to attend Eton College.",
              "[9] In 1906 he won the chemistry and physics prizes at Eton.",
              "[10] In 1906, Moseley entered Trinity College of the University of Oxford, where he earned his bachelor's degree.",
              "While an undergraduate at Oxford, Moseley became a Freemason by joining the Apollo University Lodge.",
              "[11] Immediately after graduation from Oxford in 1910, Moseley became a demonstrator in physics at the University of Manchester under the supervision of Sir Ernest Rutherford.",
              "During Moseley's first year at Manchester, he had a teaching load as a graduate teaching assistant, but following that first year, he was reassigned from his teaching duties to work as a graduate research assistant.",
              "He declined a fellowship offered by Rutherford, preferring to move back to Oxford, in November 1913, where he was given laboratory facilities but no support.",
              "[12]: 95 Experimenting with the energy of beta particles in 1912, Moseley showed that high potentials were attainable from a radioactive source of radium, thereby inventing the first atomic battery, though he was unable to produce the 1MV necessary to stop the particles.",
              "[13] In 1913, Moseley observed and measured the X-ray spectra of various chemical elements (mostly metals) that were found by the method of diffraction through crystals.",
              "[14] This was a pioneering use of the method of X-ray spectroscopy in physics, using Bragg's diffraction law to determine the X-ray wavelengths.",
              "Moseley discovered a systematic mathematical relationship between the wavelengths of the X-rays produced and the atomic numbers of the metals that were used as the targets in X-ray tubes.",
              "This has become known as Moseley's law.",
              "Before Moseley's discovery, the atomic numbers (or elemental number) of an element had been thought of as a semi-arbitrary sequential number, based on the sequence of atomic masses, but modified somewhat where chemists found this modification to be desirable, such as by the Russian chemist, Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev.",
              "In his invention of the Periodic Table of the Elements, Mendeleev had interchanged the orders of a few pairs of elements to put them in more appropriate places in this table of the elements.",
              "For example, the metals cobalt and nickel had been assigned the atomic numbers 27 and 28, respectively, based on their known chemical and physical properties, even though they have nearly the same atomic masses.",
              "In fact, the atomic mass of cobalt is slightly larger than that of nickel, which would have placed them in backwards order if they had been placed in the Periodic Table blindly according to atomic mass.",
              "Moseley's experiments in X-ray spectroscopy showed directly from their physics that cobalt and nickel have the different atomic numbers, 27 and 28, and that they are placed in the Periodic Table correctly by Moseley's objective measurements of their atomic numbers.",
              "Hence, Moseley's discovery demonstrated that the atomic numbers of elements are not just rather arbitrary numbers based on chemistry and the intuition of chemists, but rather, they have a firm experimental basis from the physics of their X-ray spectra.",
              "In addition, Moseley showed that there were gaps in the atomic number sequence at numbers 43, 61, 72, and 75.",
              "These spaces are now known, respectively, to be the places of the radioactive synthetic elements technetium and promethium, and also the last two quite rare naturally occurring stable elements hafnium (discovered 1923) and rhenium (discovered 1925).",
              "Nothing was known about these four elements in Moseley's lifetime, not even their very existence.",
              "Based on the intuition of a very experienced chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted the existence of a missing element in the Periodic Table, which was later found to be filled by technetium, and Bohuslav Brauner had predicted the existence of another missing element in this Table, which was later found to be filled by promethium.",
              "Henry Moseley's experiments confirmed these predictions, by showing exactly what the missing atomic numbers were, 43 and 61.",
              "In addition, Moseley predicted the existence of two more undiscovered elements, those with the atomic numbers 72 and 75, and gave very strong evidence that there were no other gaps in the Periodic Table between the elements aluminium (atomic number 13) and gold (atomic number 79).",
              "This latter question about the possibility of more undiscovered (\"missing\") elements had been a standing problem among the chemists of the world, particularly given the existence of the large family of the lanthanide series of rare earth elements.",
              "Moseley was able to demonstrate that these lanthanide elements, i.",
              "e. lanthanum through lutetium, must have exactly 15 members \u2013 no more and no less.",
              "The number of elements in the lanthanides had been a question that was very far from being settled by the chemists of the early 20th Century.",
              "They could not yet produce pure samples of all the rare-earth elements, even in the form of their salts, and in some cases they were unable to distinguish between mixtures of two very similar (adjacent) rare-earth elements from the nearby pure metals in the Periodic Table.",
              "For example, there was a so-called \"element\" that was even given the chemical name of \"didymium\".",
              "\"Didymium\" was found some years later to be simply a mixture of two genuine rare-earth elements, and these were given the names neodymium and praseodymium, meaning \"new twin\" and \"green twin\".",
              "Also, the method of separating the rare-earth elements by the method of ion exchange had not been invented yet in Moseley's time.",
              "Moseley's method in early X-ray spectroscopy was able to sort out the above chemical problems promptly, some of which had occupied chemists for a number of years.",
              "Moseley also predicted the existence of element 61, a lanthanide whose existence was previously unsuspected.",
              "Quite a few years later, this element 61 was created artificially in nuclear reactors and was named promethium.",
              "[15][16][17][18][19] Before Moseley and his law, atomic numbers had been thought of as a semi-arbitrary ordering number, vaguely increasing with atomic weight but not strictly defined by it.",
              "Moseley's discovery showed that atomic numbers were not arbitrarily assigned, but rather, they have a definite physical basis.",
              "Moseley postulated that each successive element has a nuclear charge exactly one unit greater than its predecessor.",
              "Moseley redefined the idea of atomic numbers from its previous status as an ad hoc numerical tag to help sorting the elements into an exact sequence of ascending atomic numbers that made the Periodic Table exact.",
              "(This was later to be the basis of the Aufbau principle in atomic studies.)",
              "As noted by Bohr, Moseley's law provided a reasonably complete experimental set of data that supported the (new from 1911) conception by Ernest Rutherford and Antonius van den Broek of the atom, with a positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons in which the atomic number is understood to be the exact physical number of positive charges (later discovered and called protons) in the central atomic nuclei of the elements.",
              "Moseley mentioned the two scientists above in his research paper, but he did not actually mention Bohr, who was rather new on the scene then.",
              "Simple modifications of Rydberg's and Bohr's formulas were found to give a theoretical justification for Moseley's empirically derived law for determining atomic numbers.",
              "X-ray spectrometers are the foundation-stones of X-ray crystallography.",
              "The X-ray spectrometers as Moseley knew them worked as follows.",
              "A glass-bulb electron tube was used, similar to that held by Moseley in the photo here.",
              "Inside the evacuated tube, electrons were fired at a metallic substance (i.",
              "e. a sample of pure element in Moseley's work), causing the ionization of electrons from the inner electron shells of the element.",
              "The rebound of electrons into these holes in the inner shells next causes the emission of X-ray photons that were led out of the tube in a semi-beam, through an opening in the external X-ray shielding.",
              "These are next diffracted by a standardized salt crystal, with angular results read out as photographic lines by the exposure of an X-ray film fixed at the outside the vacuum tube at a known distance.",
              "Application of Bragg's law (after some initial guesswork of the mean distances between atoms in the metallic crystal, based on its density) next allowed the wavelength of the emitted X-rays to be calculated.",
              "Moseley participated in the design and development of early X-ray spectrometry equipment,[20][21] learning some techniques from William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg at the University of Leeds, and developing others himself.",
              "Many of the techniques of X-ray spectroscopy were inspired by the methods that are used with visible light spectroscopes and spectrograms, by substituting crystals, ionization chambers, and photographic plates for their analogs in light spectroscopy.",
              "In some cases, Moseley found it necessary to modify his equipment to detect particularly soft (lower frequency) X-rays that could not penetrate either air or paper, by working with his instruments in a vacuum chamber.",
              "Sometime in the first half of 1914, Moseley resigned from his position at Manchester, with plans to return to Oxford and continue his physics research there.",
              "However, World War I broke out in August 1914, and Moseley turned down this job offer to instead enlist with the Royal Engineers of the British Army.",
