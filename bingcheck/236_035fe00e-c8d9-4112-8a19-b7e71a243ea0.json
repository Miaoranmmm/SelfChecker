While a variety of approaches can be used to find content that does not pass fact-checking standards and predict similar posts, the challenges of modern content moderation often require more efficient and scalable approaches than human review alone.",
              "Pew Research Center\u2019s November survey reveals a public relatively split when it comes to whether algorithms for finding false information on these platforms are good or bad for society at large \u2013 and similarly mixed views on these algorithms\u2019 performance and impact.",
              "It also finds Republicans particularly opposed to such algorithms, echoing partisan divides in other Center research related to technology and online discourse \u2013 from the seriousness of offensive content online to whether tech companies should take steps to restrict false information online in the first place.",

              "Many people say they have seen these downstream impacts of algorithms\u2019 work: About three-quarters of social media users (74%) say they have ever seen information on social media sites that has been flagged or labeled as false.",
              "And three-quarters of adults say they have heard or read at least a little about computer programs used by social media companies to detect misinformation, including 24% who have heard a lot.",

              "And even with this across-the-aisle agreement, there are stark partisan differences on the four potential impacts the survey explored \u2013 two that are positive in nature and two that are negative.",
              "On the negative end, seven-in-ten adults say political viewpoints are definitely or probably being censored on social media sites due to the widespread use of algorithms to detect false information, and a similar share (69%) says that news and information are definitely or probably being wrongly removed from the sites.",
              "Far smaller shares say the widespread use of such algorithms are leading to the two positive outcomes the survey explored.",
              "In fact, about six-in-ten (63%) say that their use is not allowing people to have more meaningful conversations on the platforms, and a similar share says it is not making it easier to find trustworthy information.",
              "Those who are most familiar with these algorithms are more likely than those who are least familiar to think they have negative impacts.",
              "For example, three-quarters of those who say they have heard or read a lot about them say news and information is being wrongly removed, while six-in-ten of those who have heard nothing at all say this.",

              "While majorities in both major political parties say political censorship and wrongful removal of information are definitely or probably happening as a result of the widespread use of these algorithms, Republicans and those who lean toward the GOP are far more likely than Democrats and leaners to say so, with differences of 28 percentage points on political censorship and 26 points on wrongful removal.",
              "This pattern appears in other Center research.",
              "For example, even as most Americans said in 2020 that social media companies likely censor political viewpoints, Republicans were especially likely to say so.",
              "At the same time, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say the positive impacts the survey explored are realities.",
              "Democrats are twice as likely to say it is getting easier to find trustworthy information on social media sites due to widespread use of algorithms to find false information, and the share of Democrats who say that this is allowing people to have more meaningful conversations is 19 points higher than among their GOP counterparts.",
              "Political party and awareness also color Americans\u2019 views when asked about the broader impact of these algorithms on society.",
              "The share of Republicans who say these programs have been a bad idea for society is about 30 points higher than the parallel share of Democrats.",
              "These findings echo double-digit partisan divides found when asking about the role of social media and the companies that run these sites in society more generally.",
              "For example, a 2020 Center study found Republicans more likely than Democrats to say technology companies have too much power in the economy, even as majorities across parties said so.",
              "In a separate 2020 survey, those who identified with the GOP were also more likely to think social media have a mostly negative impact on the way things are going in the country.",
              "The balance of views also shifts by how much people have heard about the topic.",
              "Views lean negative among those who have heard a lot, with about half saying widespread use of these algorithms is a bad idea.",
              "Compared with this group, those who have heard a little are less skeptical \u2013 a smaller share of them say this is a bad idea, but at the same time they are more likely to express uncertainty.",

              "When it comes to formal educational attainment, those with postgraduate degrees stand out in their views \u2013 half say these algorithms are a good idea for society.",
              "People\u2019s perceptions of the social media experience may factor into their views about societal impact as well.",
              "For example, a majority of Americans say people have at least a little control over the things they see on social media sites, but just one-in-ten say people have a lot of control.",
              "And a third of adults say users have no control at all.",
              "Previous Center work has also found this perceived lack of user control in other social media contexts \u2013 from the mix of news people see to what appears in their feeds.",
              "Those who think users have no control over the social media content they see are particularly likely to say algorithms for detecting false information are a bad idea for society.",
              "Some 41% of this group say social media companies\u2019 widespread use of such programs is a bad idea \u2013 about twice as high as the share who say so (20%) among those who think users have a lot of control and 11 points higher compared with those who say users have a little control (30% of this group say use of the programs is a bad idea for society).",
              "Even as social media companies work to improve the accuracy, clarity and efficiency of their algorithms, some experts say the programs are vulnerable to mistakes and bias.",
              "Others argue that even social media firms do not fully understand what their algorithms do.",
              "Yet the alternative of human reviewers poses challenges as well \u2013 from the sheer volume of posts to the potential harm to the reviewers themselves.",
              "This survey probed three key tensions that relate to the quality of the decisions made by these algorithms: How Americans perceive algorithmic decisions compared with decisions made by people, how important it is to include diverse perspectives in the creation of algorithms and whether they should prioritize speed or accuracy.",
              "A majority of Americans say decisions about what is false on social media should be made with some human input \u2013 that is, by a mix of both people and computer programs. About a fifth say they should be mostly made by people, and just 6% say they should be mostly made by computer programs. However, people are split when asked whether computers or humans do a better job finding false information.",
              "The largest share say they are not sure;",
              "another quarter say they do about the same job, while about one-in-five each say computers do a worse job (22%) or a better job (19%).",
              "Views on relative performance vary by awareness of these algorithms \u2013 nearly half (45%) of those who have seen or heard nothing say they are not sure what does a better job, compared with 30% among those who have heard a little and 22% of those who have heard a lot.",
              "At the same time, one-third of those who have heard a lot say computer programs do a worse job than humans, versus 21% of those who have heard a little and 14% of those who have heard nothing.",
              "Human judgment can make its way into assessments about what information is false on social media via fact-checker judgments, crowdsourced labeling of false information and review processes in place for contested decisions or to judge context.",
              "Even when decisions are made primarily by algorithms, various steps in creating these programs \u2013 including using fact-checker judgments to \u201ctrain\u201d computer programs \u2013 can introduce human influence into the process.",
              "The resulting potential for algorithms to also codify bias has been increasingly in the public eye.",
              "For example, recently released documents describe concerns with programs designed to detect hate speech failing to protect Black people from harassment, and Black social media users have expressed frustration over content being flagged as inappropriate, mistakenly or intentionally.",
              "Other investigations have focused on whether algorithms promote some political viewpoints over others amid widely perceived censorship by social media companies.",
              "When it comes to the public\u2019s views, a majority of Americans said in 2018 that computer programs always reflect the biases of their creators, though 40% thought it possible to make decisions free from human bias.",
              "Some have pointed to the lack of meaningful diversity in the technology companies that create and use these programs as one contributing factor.",
              "When asked about who companies should include at the algorithmic design stage, notable shares of Americans say including members of a range of groups is important.",
              "About six-in-ten or more say it is extremely or very important that social media companies include people of different racial and ethnic groups (67%), political viewpoints (65%) and genders (63%) when creating computer programs to find false information.",
              "In each case, about four-in-ten Americans say it is extremely important to include these groups.",
              "Those who have heard at least a little about the use of computer programs by social media companies to find false information on their sites place more importance on diversity in algorithmic design than do those who have heard nothing at all.",
              "And partisans differ dramatically in how important they view including people of different racial, ethnic and gender groups to be, with Democrats being more likely than Republicans to say these things are extremely or very important.",
              "Women are more likely than men to say that including people of different genders is extremely or very important (67% vs. 58%), and Black adults (73%) are more likely than White (65%) or Hispanic adults (63%) to say the same when it comes to people of different racial and ethnic groups.",
              "There is little difference by political party in the importance placed on diversity of political viewpoints at the creation stage of these algorithms. (The survey also sought Americans\u2019 opinions about whether the experiences and views of various groups are taken into account when artificial intelligence programs are created;",
              "these varying perspectives are covered in Chapter 1.)",
              "Finally, the survey explored Americans\u2019 views of the tension between the speed with which decisions can be made versus the accuracy of these decisions.",
              "Fully 69% of Americans say social media companies should prioritize accurate decisions, even if some false information stays up on sites for a longer period of time \u2013 while 28% say they should give priority to quick decisions, even if some accurate information gets mistakenly removed.",
              "Compared with accuracy, relatively small shares in both parties say speed should be prioritized;",
              "however, the share of Democrats who say so is 20 points higher than the share of Republicans who say the same (38% vs. 18%).",
              "Women are also more likely than men to say speed should be the priority (32% vs. 24%), as are Black (41%) or Hispanic (32%) adults compared with White adults (24%).",
              "Whistleblower testimony has reignited debate about regulating the algorithms social media companies use.",
              "At the same time, federal agencies are pushing social media companies to disclose more about the data they collect and how their algorithms work.",
              "While some have called for more regulation of algorithms generally, there is still debate about how this should be accomplished \u2013 in part because of internet and free speech issues that could eventually end up in the courts.",

              "Social media has undoubtedly integrated itself into society, but the question remains on how to properly negotiate our relationship with it.",
              "Nina Vasan, clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford and founder and executive director at Brainstorm: The Stanford Lab for Mental Health Innovation, and Sara Johansen, resident psychiatrist at Stanford and director of clinical innovation at Stanford Brainstorm, explored possible answers to that question during a Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI seminar by outlining the impact of social media on mental health and psychological underpinnings of social media addiction, as well as possible opportunities to mitigate risk and promote wellbeing.",

              "\u201d One result of trapping users into endless scrolling loops is that it can lead to social comparison.",
              "When presented with the curated feeds of other people, we are vulnerable to \u201cfrequent and extreme upward social comparison,\u201d which can lead to a number of negative side-effects such as erosion of self-esteem, depressed mood, and decreased life satisfaction.",

              "To moderate the vitriol of cyber-bullying, many companies have turned to AI as a method for classifying comments with negative sentiment and filtering them or prompting commenters to pause and reconsider their actions.",
              "Social media platforms are now working to ban communities that post harmful content.",
              "Many apps such as TikTok and Pinterest will present information on hotlines and support resources as a response to search queries for self-harm, suicide, depression, and eating disorder-related content.",

              "Instead of approaching screen time through the \u201cdisplacement hypothesis,\u201d which suggests the negative impact of technology is directly related to exposure, they recommend the \u201cGoldilocks\u201d hypothesis, which identifies moderate use as optimal for wellbeing.",
              "On social media platforms, most risk mitigation methods are focused on non-maleficence, based on the principle to do no harm.",
              "Vasan and Johansen suggest that we should also consider beneficence, which is to do good.",
              "For example, Brainstorm\u2019s recent work with Pinterest led to Pinterest Compassionate Search, which offers free therapeutic exercises on the platform in response to depression-related search terms. Both psychiatrists emphasized a need for more social media-specific research, with even more granularity with respect to individual apps and not just smartphone use as a whole.",
              "They also recommend app makers consider more than the most simplistic business incentives.",
              "As we shift from \u201cminimizing harm to promoting wellbeing,\u201d Johansen says, it is important to realize that the friction associated with making apps less addictive \u201cis going to come at a loss of some growth.",
              "\u201d In the end it comes down to choosing that option because \u201cit\u2019s the ethical thing to do, because we have a responsibility to help these young minds develop in a healthy way.",

              "Read our research on: Israel | Internet & Technology | Science Read our research on: Israel | Internet & Technology | Science The social media environment is another prominent example of algorithmic decision-making in Americans\u2019 daily lives.",
              "Nearly all the content people see on social media is chosen not by human editors but rather by computer programs using massive quantities of data about each user to deliver content that he or she might find relevant or engaging.",
              "This has led to widespread concerns that these sites are promoting content that is attention-grabbing but ultimately harmful to users \u2013 such as misinformation, sensationalism or \u201chate clicks.",
              "\u201d To more broadly understand public attitudes toward algorithms in this context, the survey asked respondents a series of questions about the content they see on social media, the emotions that content arouses, and their overall comfort level with these sites using their data to serve them different types of information.",
              "And like the questions around the impact of algorithms discussed in the preceding chapter, this portion of the survey led with a broad question about whether the public thinks social media reflects overall public sentiment.",
              "On this score, a majority of Americans (74%) think the content people post on social media does not provide an accurate picture of how society feels about important issues, while one-quarter say it does.",
              "Certain groups of Americans are more likely than others to think that social media paints an accurate picture of society writ large.",
              "Notably, blacks (37%) and Hispanics (35%) are more likely than whites (20%) to say this is the case.",
              "And the same is true of younger adults compared with their elders: 35% of 18- to 29-year-olds think that social media paints an accurate portrait of society, but that share drops to 19% among those ages 65 and older.",
              "Still, despite these differences, a majority of Americans across a wide range of demographic groups feel that social media is not representative of public opinion more broadly.",
              "When asked about six different emotions that they might experience due to the content they see on social media, the largest share of users (88% in total) say they see content on these sites that makes them feel amused.",
              "Amusement is also the emotion that the largest share of users (44%) frequently experience on these sites.",
              "Social media also leads many users to feel anger.",
              "A total of 71% of social media users report encountering content that makes them angry, and one-quarter see this type of content frequently.",
              "Similar shares say they encounter content that makes them feel connected (71%) or inspired (69%).",
              "Meanwhile, around half (49%) say they encounter content that makes them feel depressed, and 31% indicate that they at least sometimes see content that makes them feel lonely.",
              "Identical shares of users across a range of age groups say they frequently encounter content on social media that makes them feel angry.",
              "But other emotions exhibit more variation based on age.",
              "Notably, younger adults are more likely than older adults to say they frequently encounter content on social media that makes them feel lonely.",
              "Some 15% of social media users ages 18 to 29 say this, compared with 7% of those ages 30 to 49 and just 4% of those 50 and older.",
              "Conversely, a relatively small share of older adults are frequently amused by content they see on social media.",
              "In fact, similar shares of social media users ages 65 and older say they frequently see content on these platforms that makes them feel amused (30%) and angry (24%).",
              "A recent Pew Research Center analysis of congressional Facebook pages found that the \u201canger\u201d emoticon is now the most common reaction to posts by members of Congress.",
              "And although this survey did not ask about the specific types of content that might make people angry, it does find a modest correlation between the frequency with which users see content that makes them angry and their overall political affiliation.",
              "Some 31% of conservative Republicans say they frequently feel angry due to things they see on social media (compared with 19% of moderate or liberal Republicans), as do 27% of liberal Democrats (compared with 19% of moderate or conservative Democrats).",
              "Along with asking about the emotions social media platforms inspire in users, the survey also included a series of questions about how often social media users encounter certain types of behaviors and content.",
              "These findings indicate that users see two types of content especially frequently: posts that are overly dramatic or exaggerated (58% of users say they see this type of content frequently) and people making accusations or starting arguments without waiting until they have all the facts (59% see this frequently).",
              "A majority of social media users also say they at least sometimes encounter posts that appear to be about one thing but turn out to be about something else, as well as posts that teach them something useful they hadn\u2019t known before.",
              "But in each instance, fewer than half say they see these sorts of posts frequently.",
              "Beyond the emotions they feel while browsing social media, users are exposed to a mix of positive and negative behaviors from others.",
              "Around half (54%) of social media users say they typically see an equal mix of people being kind or supportive and people being mean or bullying.",
              "Around one-in-five (21%) say they more often see people being kind and supportive on these sites, while a comparable share (24%) says they more often see people being mean or bullying.",
              "Previous surveys by the Center have found that men are slightly more likely than women to encounter any sort of harassing or abusive behavior online.",
              "And in this instance, a slightly larger share of men (29%) than women (19%) say they more often see people being mean or bullying content on social media platforms than see kind behavior.",
              "Women, on the other hand, are slightly more likely than men to say that they more often see people being kind or supportive.",
              "But the largest shares of both men (52%) and women (56%) say that they typically see an equal mix of supportive and bullying behavior on social media.",
              "When asked about the efforts they see other users making to spread \u2013 or correct \u2013 misinformation, around two-thirds of users (63%) say they generally see an even mix of people trying to be deceptive and people trying to point out inaccurate information.",
              "Similar shares more often see one of these behaviors than others, with 18% of users saying they more often see people trying to be deceptive and 17% saying they more often see people trying to point out inaccurate information.",
              "Men are around twice as likely as women to say they more often seeing people being deceptive on social media (24% vs. 13%).",
              "But majorities of both men (58%) and women (67%) see an equal mix of deceptiveness and attempts to correct misinformation.",
              "The vast quantities of data that social media companies possess about their users \u2013 including behaviors, likes, clicks and other information users provide about themselves \u2013 are ultimately what allows these platforms to deliver individually targeted content in an automated fashion.",
              "And this survey finds that users\u2019 comfort level with this behavior is heavily context-dependent.",
              "They are relatively accepting of their data being used for certain types of messages, but much less comfortable when it is used for other purposes.",
              "Three-quarters of social media users find it acceptable for those platforms to use data about them and their online behavior to recommend events in their area that they might be interested in, while a smaller majority (57%) thinks it is acceptable if their data are used to recommend other people they might want to be friends with.",
              "On the other hand, users are somewhat less comfortable with these sites using their data to show advertisements for products or services.",
              "Around half (52%) think this behavior is acceptable, but a similar share (47%) finds it to be not acceptable \u2013 and the share that finds it not at all acceptable (21%) is roughly double the share who finds it very acceptable (11%).",
              "Meanwhile, a substantial majority of users think it is not acceptable for social media platforms to use their data to deliver messages from political campaigns \u2013 and 31% say this is not acceptable at all.",
              "Relatively sizable majorities of users across a range of age groups think it is acceptable for social media sites to use their data to show them events happening in their area.",
              "And majorities of users across a range of age categories feel it is not acceptable for social platforms to use their data to serve them ads from political campaigns.",
              "But outside of these specific similarities, older users are much less accepting of social media sites using their data for other reasons.",
              "This is most pronounced when it comes to using that data to recommend other people they might know.",
              "By a two-to-one margin (66% to 33%), social media users ages 18 to 49 think this is an acceptable use of their data.",
              "But by a similar 63% to 36% margin, users ages 65 and older say this is not acceptable.",
              "Similarly, nearly six-in-ten users ages 18 to 49 think it is acceptable for these sites to use their data to show them advertisements for products or services, but that share falls to 39% among those 65 and older.",
              "Beyond using their personal data in these specific ways, social media users express consistent and pronounced opposition to these platforms changing their sites in certain ways for some users but not others.",
              "Roughly eight-in-ten social media users think it is unacceptable for these platforms to do things like remind some users but not others to vote on election day (82%), or to show some users more of their friends\u2019 happy posts and fewer of their sad posts (78%).",
              "And even the standard A/B testing that most platforms engage in on a continuous basis is viewed with much suspicion by users: 78% of users think it is unacceptable for social platforms to change the look and feel of their site for some users but not others.",
              "Older users are overwhelmingly opposed to these interventions.",
              "But even among younger users, large shares find them problematic even in their most common forms. For instance, 71% of social media users ages 18 to 29 say it is unacceptable for these sites to change the look and feel for some users but not others.",

              "g., regression, Bayesian) as well as deep learning (i.",
              "e., neural methods such as CNN and RNN).",
              "More specifically, classification of social media content is a fundamental task for social media mining, so that most existing methods regard it as a text categorization problem and mainly focus on using content features, such as words and hashtags (Wu and Liu 2018).",
              "The main challenge facing these approaches is how to extract features in a way to reduce the data used to train their models and what features are the most suitable for accurate results.",
              "Researchers using such approaches are motivated by the fact that the news content is the main entity in the deception process, and it is a straightforward factor to analyze and use while looking for predictive clues of deception.",
              "However, detecting fake news only from the content of the news is not enough because the news is created in a strategic intentional way to mimic the truth (i.",
              "e., the content can be intentionally manipulated by the spreader to make it look like real news).",
              "Therefore, it is considered to be challenging, if not impossible, to identify useful features (Wu and Liu 2018) and consequently tell the nature of such news solely from the content.",
              "Moreover, works that utilize only the news content for fake news detection ignore the rich information and latent user intelligence (Qian et al.",
              "2018) stored in user responses toward previously disseminated articles.",
              "Therefore, the auxiliary information is deemed crucial for an effective fake news detection approach.",
              "The context-based approaches explore the surrounding data outside of the news content, which can be an effective direction and has some advantages in areas where the content approaches based on text classification can run into issues.",
              "However, most existing studies implementing contextual methods mainly focus on additional information coming from users and network diffusion patterns.",
              "Moreover, from a technical perspective, they are limited to the use of sophisticated machine learning techniques for feature extraction, and they ignore the usefulness of results coming from techniques such as web search and crowdsourcing which may save much time and help in the early detection and identification of fake content.",
              "Hybrid approaches can simultaneously model different aspects of fake news such as the content-based aspects, as well as the contextual aspect based on both the OSN user and the OSN network patterns.",
              "However, these approaches are deemed more complex in terms of models (Bondielli and Marcelloni 2019), data availability, and the number of features.",
              "Furthermore, it remains difficult to decide which information among each category (i.",
              "e., content-based and context-based information) is most suitable and appropriate to be used to achieve accurate and precise results.",
              "Therefore, there are still very few studies belonging to this category of hybrid approaches.",
              "As fake news usually evolves and spreads very fast on social media, it is critical and urgent to consider early detection directions.",
              "Yet, this is a challenging task to do especially in highly dynamic platforms such as social networks.",
              "Both news content- and social context-based approaches suffer from this challenging early detection of fake news.",
              "Although approaches that detect fake news based on content analysis face this issue less, they are still limited by the lack of information required for verification when the news is in its early stage of spread.",
              "However, approaches that detect fake news based on contextual analysis are most likely to suffer from the lack of early detection since most of them rely on information that is mostly available after the spread of fake content such as social engagement, user response, and propagation patterns.",
              "Therefore, it is crucial to consider both trusted human verification and historical data as an attempt to detect fake content during its early stage of propagation.",
              "In this paper, we introduced the general context of the fake news problem as one of the major issues of the online deception problem in online social networks.",
              "Based on reviewing the most relevant state of the art, we summarized and classified existing definitions of fake news, as well as its related terms. We also listed various typologies and existing categorizations of fake news such as intent-based fake news including clickbait, hoax, rumor, satire, propaganda, conspiracy theories, framing as well as content-based fake news including text and multimedia-based fake news, and in the latter, we can tackle deepfake videos and GAN-generated fake images.",

              "For example, several incidents of public health concerns arose out of social media misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
              "Against the backdrop of the emerging IS research focus on social media and the impact of misinformation during recent events such as the COVID-19, Australian Bushfire, and the USA elections, we identified disaster, health, and politics as specific domains for a research review on social media misinformation.",
              "Following a systematic review process, we chose 28 articles, relevant to the three themes, for synthesis.",
              "We discuss the characteristics of misinformation in the three domains, the methodologies that have been used by researchers, and the theories used to study misinformation.",
              "We adapt an Antecedents-Misinformation-Outcomes (AMIO) framework for integrating key concepts from prior studies.",
              "Based on the AMIO framework, we further discuss the inter-relationships of concepts and the strategies to control the spread of misinformation on social media.",
              "Ours is one of the early reviews focusing on social media misinformation research, particularly on three socially sensitive domains;",
              "disaster, health, and politics.",
              "This review contributes to the emerging body of knowledge in Data Science and social media and informs strategies to combat social media misinformation.",
              "Rumors, misinformation, disinformation, and mal-information are common challenges confronting media of all types.",
              "It is, however, worse in the case of digital media, especially on social media platforms. Ease of access and use, speed of information diffusion, and difficulty in correcting false information make control of undesirable information a horrid task [1].",
              "Alongside these challenges, social media has also been highly influential in spreading timely and useful information.",
              "For example, the recent #BlackLivesMatter movement was enabled by social media, which united concurring people's solidarity across the world when George Floyd was killed due to police brutality, and so are 2011 Arab spring in the Middle East and the 2017 #MeToo movement against sexual harassments and abuse [2, 3].",
              "Although, scholars have addressed information disorder in social media, a synthesis of the insights from these studies are rare.",
              "The information which is fake or misleading and spreads unintentionally is known as misinformation [4].",
              "Prior research on misinformation in social media has highlighted various characteristics of misinformation and interventions thereof in different contexts.",
              "The issue of misinformation has become dominant with the rise of social media, attracting scholarly attention, particularly after the 2016 USA Presidential election, when misinformation apparently influenced the election results [5].",
              "The word 'misinformation' was listed as one of the global risks by the World Economic Forum [6].",
              "A similar term that is popular and confusing along with misinformation is 'disinformation'.",
              "It is defined as the information that is fake or misleading, and unlike misinformation, spreads intentionally.",
              "Disinformation campaigns are often seen in a political context where state actors create them for political gains.",
              "In India, during the initial stage of COVID-19, there was reportedly a surge in fake news linking the virus outbreak to a particular religious group.",
              "This disinformation spread gained media attention as it was widely shared on social media platforms. As a result of the targeting, it eventually translated into physical violence and discriminatory treatment against members of the community in some of the Indian states [7].",
              "'Rumors' and 'fake news' are similar terms related to misinformation.",
              "'Rumors' are unverified information or statements circulated with uncertainty, and 'fake news' is the misinformation that is distributed in an official news format.",
              "Source ambiguity, personal involvement, confirmation bias, and social ties are some of the rumor-causing factors.",
              "Yet another related term, mal-information, is accurate information that is used in different contexts to spread hatred or abuse of a person or a particular group.",
              "Our review focuses on misinformation that is spread through social media platforms. The words 'rumor', and 'misinformation' are used interchangeably in this paper.",
              "Further, we identify factors that cause misinformation based on a systematic review of prior studies.",
              "Ours is one of the early attempts to review social media research on misinformation.",
              "This review focuses on three sensitive domains of disaster, health, and politics, setting three objectives: (a) to analyze previous studies to understand the impact of misinformation on the three domains (b) to identify theoretical perspectives used to examine the spread of misinformation on social media and (c) to develop a framework to study key concepts and their inter-relationships emerging from prior studies.",
              "We identified these specific areas as the impact of misinformation with regards to both speed of spread and scale of influence are high and detrimental to the public and governments.",
              "To the best of our knowledge, the review of the literature on social media misinformation themes are relatively scanty.",
              "This review contributes to an emerging body of knowledge in Data Science and informs the efforts to combat social media misinformation.",
              "Data Science is an interdisciplinary area which incorporates different areas like statistics, management, and sociology to study the data and create knowledge out of data [8].",
              "This review will also inform future studies that aim to evaluate and compare patterns of misinformation on sensitive themes of social relevance, such as disaster, health, and politics.",
              "The paper is structured as follows.",
              "The first section introduces misinformation in social media context.",
              "In Sect.",
              "2, we provide a brief overview of prior research works on misinformation and social media.",
              "Section 3 describes the research methodology, which includes details of the literature search and selection process.",
              "Section 4 discusses the analysis of spread of misinformation on social media based on three themes- disaster, health, and politics and the review findings.",
              "This includes current state of research, theoretical foundations, determinants of misinformation in social media platforms, and strategies to control the spread of misinformation.",
              "Section 5 concludes with the implications and limitations of the paper.",
              "Misinformation arises in uncertain contexts when people are confronted with a scarcity of information they need.",
              "During unforeseen circumstances, the affected individual or community experiences nervousness or anxiety.",
              "Anxiety is one of the primary reasons behind the spread of misinformation.",
              "To overcome this tension, people tend to gather information from sources such as mainstream media and official government social media handles to verify the information they have received.",
              "When they fail to receive information from official sources, they collect related information from their peer circles or other informal sources, which would help them to control social tension [9].",
              "Furthermore, in an emergency context, misinformation helps community members to reach a common understanding of the uncertain situation.",
              "Social media has increasingly grown in power and influence and has acted as a medium to accelerate sociopolitical movements.",
              "Network effects enhance participation in social media platforms which in turn spread information (good or bad) at a faster pace compared to traditional media.",
              "Furthermore, due to a massive surge in online content consumption primarily through social media both business organizations and political parties have begun to share content that are ambiguous or fake to influence online users and their decisions for financial and political gains [9, 10].",
              "On the other hand, people often approach social media with a hedonic mindset, which reduces their tendency to verify the information they receive [9].",
              "Repetitive exposure to contents that coincides with their pre-existing beliefs, increases believability and shareability of content.",
              "This process known as the echo-chamber effect [11] is fueled by confirmation bias.",
              "Confirmation bias is the tendency of the person to support information that reinforces pre-existing beliefs and neglect opposing perspectives and viewpoints other than their own.",
              "Platforms\u2019 structure and algorithms also have an essential role in spreading misinformation.",
              "Tiwana et al.",
              "[12] have defined platform architecture as \u2018a conceptual blueprint that describes how the ecosystem is partitioned into a relatively stable platform and a complementary set of modules that are encouraged to vary, and the design rules binding on both\u2019.",
              "Business models of these platforms are based upon maximizing user engagement.",
              "For example, in the case of Facebook or Twitter, user feed is based on their existing belief or preferences.",
              "User feeds provide users with similar content that matches their existing beliefs, thus contributing to the echo chamber effect.",
              "Platform architecture makes the transmission and retransmission of misinformation easier [12, 13].",
              "For instance, WhatsApp has a one-touch forward option that enables users to forward messages simultaneously to multiple users.",
              "Earlier, a WhatsApp user could forward a message to 250 groups or users at a time, which as a measure for controlling the spread of misinformation was limited to five members in 2019.",
              "WhatsApp claimed that globally this restriction reduced message forwarding by 25% [14].",
              "Apart from platform politics, users also have an essential role in creating or distributing misinformation.",
              "In a disaster context, people tend to share misinformation based on their subjective feeling [15].",
              "Misinformation has the power to influence the decisions of its audience.",
              "It can change a citizen's approach toward a topic or a subject.",
              "The anti-vaccine movement on Twitter during the 2015 measles (highly communicable disease) outbreak in Disneyland, California, serves as a good example.",
              "The movement created conspiracy theories and mistrust on the State, which increased vaccine refusal rate [16].",
              "Misinformation could even influence election of governments by manipulating citizens\u2019 political attitudes as seen in the 2016 USA and 2017 French elections [17].",
              "Of late, people rely heavily on Twitter and Facebook to collect the latest happenings from mainstream media [18].",
              "Combating misinformation in social media has been a challenging task for governments in several countries.",
              "When social media influences elections [17] and health campaigns (like vaccination), governments and international agencies demand social media owners to take necessary actions to combat misinformation [13, 15].",
              "Platforms began to regulate bots that were used to spread misinformation.",
              "Facebook announced the filtering of their algorithms to combat misinformation, down-ranking the post flagged by their fact-checkers which will reduce the popularity of the post or page.",
              "[17].",
              "However, misinformation has become a complicated issue due to the growth of new users and the emergence of new social media platforms. Jang et al.",
              "[19] have suggested two approaches other than governmental regulation to control misinformation literary and corrective.",
              "The literary approach proposes educating users to increase their cognitive ability to differentiate misinformation from the information.",
              "The corrective approach provides more fact-checking facilities for users.",
              "Warnings would be provided against potentially fabricated content based on crowdsourcing.",
              "Both approaches have limitations;",
              "the literary approach attracted criticism as it transfers responsibility for the spread of misinformation to citizens.",
              "The corrective approach will only have a limited impact as the volume of fabricated content escalates [19\u201321].",
              "An overview of the literature on misinformation reveals that most investigations focus on examining the methods to combat misinformation.",
              "Social media platforms are still discovering new tools and techniques to mitigate misinformation from their platforms, this calls for a research to understand their strategies.",
              "This research followed a systematic literature review process.",
              "The study employed a structured approach based on Webster\u2019s Guidelines [22] to identify relevant literature on the spread of misinformation.",
              "These guidelines helped in maintaining a quality standard while selecting the literature for review.",
              "The initial stage of the study involved exploring research papers from relevant databases to understand the volumes and availability of research articles.",
              "We extended the literature search to interdisciplinary databases too.",
              "We gathered articles from Web of Science, ACM digital library, AIS electronic library, EBSCO host business source premier, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Springer link.",
              "Apart from this, a manual search was performed in Information Systems (IS) scholars' basket of journals [23] to ensure we did not miss any articles from these journals.",
              "We have also preferred articles that have Data Science and Information Systems background.",
              "The systematic review process began with keyword search using predefined keywords (Fig.",
              "2).",
              "We identified related synonyms such as 'misinformation', 'rumors', 'spread', and 'social media' along with their combinations for the search process.",
              "The keyword search was on the title, abstract, and on the list of keywords.",
              "The literature search was conducted in the month of April 2020.",
              "Later, we revisited the literature in December 2021 to include latest publications from 2020 to 2021.",
              "Systematic literature review process It was observed that scholarly discussion about \u2018misinformation and social media\u2019 began to appear in research after 2008.",
              "Later in 2010, the topic gained more attention when Twitter bots were used or spreading fake news on the replacement of a USA Senator [24].",
              "Hate campaigns and fake follower activities were simultaneously growing during that period.",
              "As evident from Fig.",
              "1, showing number of articles published between 2005 and 2021 on misinformation in three databases: Scopus, Springer, and EBSCO, academic engagement on misinformation seems to have gained more impetus after the 2016 US Presidential election, when social media platforms had apparently influenced the election [20].",

              "In particular, we focused on the three domains of disaster, health, and politics.",
              "This thematic focus of our review has two underlying reasons (a) the impact of misinformation through social media is sporadic and has the most damaging effects in these three domains and (b) our selection criteria in systematic review finally resulted in research papers that related to these three domains.",
              "This review has excluded platforms that are designed for professional and business users such as LinkedIn and Behance.",
              "A rational for the choice of these themes are discussed in the next section.",

              "and articles on misinformation that are not akin to social media.",
              "To fetch the best from these articles, we selected articles that were from top journals, rated above three according to ABS rating and A*, A, and B according to ABDC rating.",
              "This process, while ensuring the quality of papers, also effectively shortened purview of study to 643 articles of acceptable quality.",
              "We have not performed track-back and track-forward on references.",
              "During this process, duplicate records were also identified and removed.",

              "Disclosure requirements alone are not self-enforcing.",
              "A dedicated regulatory agency must define and implement them through rulemaking and must have full enforcement powers, including the ability to fine and issue injunctions.",

              "The response to the second criticism, that transparency by itself won\u2019t do much to stem the tide of disinformation and hate speech, is that without transparency, no other regulatory measures will be effective.",
              "Whatever else governments might need to do to control social media misbehavior in content moderation, they have to mandate openness, which requires implementing specific rules governing these disclosures.",
              "Transparency is not a single policy tool.",
              "It has different dimensions.",
              "Roughly, they are providing disclosures to users, public reporting, and access to data for researchers.",
              "Disclosure to users includes revealing information about the content moderation standards a social media company has in place, its enforcement processes, and explanations of take downs and other content moderation actions, descriptions of complaint procedures, among other things.",
              "Each of these outputs provide users with opportunities to complain about problematic content and to receive due process when social media companies take action against them.",
              "While general requirements for disclosures to users can be written in statute, a regulator would have to determine the specifics, which might differ according to the characteristics of a company\u2019s line of business.",
              "The regulator would have to specify, for instance, at what level of detail content rules and enforcement processes need to be disclosed to users, when and how often, and the adequacy and timing of notification and complaint procedures.",
              "This should be done through public rulemaking with input from civil society, industry, and academia.",
              "Without these regulatory specifications and enforcement, disclosures to users might well be useless.",
              "The second dimension of transparency is transparency reporting.",
              "This includes reports and internal audits of platform content moderation activity, the risks created through social media company activities, the role of algorithms in distributing harmful speech, assessments of what the companies do about hate speech, disinformation, material harmful to teens, and other problematic content.",
              "Transparency reporting could also include a company\u2019s own assessment of whether its activities are politically discriminatory, a favorite topic of political conservatives.",
              "For instance, a 2021 internal Twitter assessment disconfirmed conservative complaints of bias, finding instead greater algorithmic amplification of tweets by conservative political leaders and media outlets.",
              "Regulators are absolutely key in implementing transparency reporting duties.",
              "They have to specify what risks must be assessed and what statistics have to be provided to assess these risks.",
              "It cannot be left up to the companies to determine the content of these reports;",
              "and the details cannot be specified in legislation.",
              "How to measure prevalence of harmful material on social media is not an immediately obvious thing.",
              "Is it views of hate speech, for instance, as a percentage of all views of content?",
              "Or is it hateful posts as a percentage of all posts?",
              "The metrics that must be contained in these reports have to be worked out by the regulator, in conjunction with the industry and with researchers who will use this public information to assess platform success in content moderation.",
              "There might be a place here, although not a determinative one, for a social media self-regulatory group, similar to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the broker-dealer industry organization, to define common reporting standards.",
              "Almost certainly the important and relevant statistics will change over time and so there must be regulatory procedures to review and update reporting statistics.",
              "The third element of transparency, access to data for researchers, is a very powerful tool, perhaps the most important one of all.",
              "It requires social media companies to provide qualified researchers with access to the internal company data that researchers need to conduct independent evaluations.",
              "These outside evaluations would not be under company control and would assess company performance on content moderation and the prevalence of harmful material.",
              "Data transparency would also allow vetted researchers to validate internal company studies, such as Twitter\u2019s own assessment of political bias.",
              "The digital regulator in conjunction with research agencies such as the National Science Foundation or the National Institute of Health would have to vet the researchers and the research projects.",
              "Researchers and civil society groups working with an industry self-regulatory organization can help define access parameters, but ultimately, they will have to be approved by a government agency.",
              "The regulator must at a minimum assure that companies do not seek to frustrate the goals of access transparency by not providing timely or accurate data.",
              "But even assuming company goodwill to comply with the rules, there are lots of controversies in this area that only a regulator can resolve.",
              "Regulators will need to decide whether researchers will be able to access data on premises, through application programming interfaces, or a combination of both.",
              "Resolving this might require the regulator to make a balancing judgment on compliance burden versus data utility.",
              "Another issue is whether the data has to be provided to researchers in a form that technologically protects privacy, and if so, which form.",
              "Is it differential privacy or K-anonymity or some other technique?",
              "Alternatively, some research might demand access to identifiable data, and privacy can only be assured by contract such that a researcher involved in a serious privacy violation would be banned from further access to social data and might face financial penalties as well.",
              "Proprietary algorithms need to be protected from public disclosure, and yet researchers need access to algorithmic input data, output data, and the algorithm itself to assess the systematic effects of social media policies and practices on information disorder.",
              "Confidentiality conditions have to be specified and enforced by the regulator.",
              "Another controversial issue is whether access should be limited to researchers with an academic or research institute affiliation.",
              "What about civil society groups, advocacy groups, and journalists?",
              "This could be specified in advance by legislation, but only a regulator can make a determination about whether a particular institutional affiliation counts as one of the approved affiliations.",
              "In addition to vetting researcher qualifications and affiliations, the regulatory agency must develop techniques to avoid or mitigate the risks of partisan hatchet jobs or industrial espionage disguised as research.",
              "Resolution of each of these issues will require the combined efforts of all the stakeholders and ultimately a regulatory decision to reach closure.",
              "No one should pretend implementation of these transparency measures will be easy, but without an authoritative regulatory to get to closure on these questions and to enforce decisions once made, the entire transparency project is at risk of being an empty exercise.",
              "Seeing all that is involved in implementing transparency measures brings us back to one question: Why do this at all?",
              "What good does transparency do?",
              "In general, the answer is that it provides public accountability.",
              "Without transparency, due process for social media users is impossible.",
              "If users do not know what the rules are, how can they stay within the guardrails?",
              "If they have no mechanism to complain about problematic content or about mistaken moderation decisions, how can the content moderation process satisfy the demands of procedural fairness for users?",
              "Disclosure and due process are so intimately linked that user transparency measures often include due process requirements.",
              "For instance, often legislation does not merely require platforms to disclose whatever complaint process they happen to have, it also requires platforms to have a complaint process.",
              "Mandated public reports on moderation practices are likely to improve content moderation, just as accounting reporting requirements encourage good corporate financial conduct.",
              "When companies know that they will have to issue these detailed assessments, they are more likely to take steps to mitigate problems to reduce the reputational risks that would come with a poor report card.",
              "Researcher access to internal company data allows independent outside assessments of company conduct and can indicate areas for improvement that the companies themselves might have missed or tried to cover up in their public reports.",
              "As one of the participants in the Georgetown tech workshop mentioned, in some cases companies might be involved in illegal activity, such as targeting housing ads on the basis of prohibited characteristics.",
              "Outside independent audits can help to detect that.",
              "Of course, more might be needed than just transparency mandates.",
              "When I described this transparency approach to one government official recently, he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t tell companies that pollute our air and water to describe the inner workings of their pollution control equipment.",
              "We put in place permissible emission levels and require them to meet these requirements.",
              "\u201d It\u2019s a good analogy.",
              "Content moderation efforts suffer from an externality problem similar to environmental pollution.",
              "Polluting companies export the cost of pollution rather than experience it themselves.",
              "Social media companies also externalize the harms they exacerbate.",
              "The Rohingya suffered far more from the hate speech that Facebook (now, Meta) allowed on its platform than Facebook did.",
              "It might seem sensible, then, to mandate content controls on social media companies just like we mandate pollution controls on companies.",
              "The difference, of course, is that content moderation has to do with speech.",
              "There are good policy reasons to be careful about mandating speech controls\u2014they constantly risk throwing out the baby with the bathwater, the good speech with the bad.",
              "There are also constitutional standards that would constrain, in the U.",
              "S.",
              "at least, efforts to ban harmful material such as hate speech and disinformation.",
              "Still, there might be additional regulatory measures short of speech controls that would be helpful.",
              "A key advantage of transparency is that it can illuminate the areas where additional measures are needed and which ones are most likely to be effective.",
              "Maybe we should require use of neutral disinformation prevention techniques, such as the pre-bunking measures Google investigated recently, or the inoculation techniques researchers have tested to counteract the persuasive effects of repetition.",
              "Social scientists like Leticia Bode at Georgetown regularly test other misinformation prevention techniques, adding to our understanding of what works and what doesn\u2019t.",
              "Or perhaps, as another participant at the Georgetown symposium mentioned, it might be effective to mandate the recall of certain amplification techniques if they proved harmful, the way the Food and Drug Administration can recall a drug with serious toxic side effects.",
              "Along those lines, Senator Amy Klobuchar has proposed legislation to have the National Science Foundation identify \u201ccontent neutral\u201d restrictions on social media algorithms that might reduce the spread of harmful material.",
              "The problem is that we don\u2019t know enough yet to mandate any of these measures.",
              "In the face of this ignorance, it is pointless and maybe dangerous to mandate specific remediation techniques.",
              "In a recent conversation, a European regulator shared that transparency is an essential part of a social media regulatory feedback loop.",
              "Transparency leads to more information about what content moderation techniques work, which leads to better regulations, which leads to better information, which leads to better regulations, and the cycle continues.",
              "The more policymakers know about the inner workings of social media companies through transparency disclosures, the more likely it is that they will be able to devise ways to improve content moderation.",
              "We know what the problems of social media content moderation are: hate speech, disinformation, amplification of terrorist material, and material that harms minors.",

This is linked to the development of cognitive competences, where critical thinking, socio-emotional competences, and technical competences are fundamental, considering the social context.",
              "The development of socio-emotional competences stands out since social media are a frequent place of interaction between people.",
              "The transformation of society has been linked to technological changes that are an important part of people\u2019s lives [1,2].",
              "Digital technologies are inserted in aspects of social life, in families and relations with others, at work, in governance and political participation, and they generate new ways to shape a community [3,4,5].",
              "In this sense, social media are widely used by different societies, transcending the geographical borders of territories and cultures, connecting the global to the local [6,7].",
              "Staying on the Internet and social media for extended periods has resulted in media and digital literacy continuing to gain importance [1].",
              "It is important to specify that social media differ from other types of Internet platforms in that they are characterized by their mass use, they allow content creation, and are not only consumed passively, making it possible for people who do not have formal knowledge about mass media to produce information [8].",
              "This is even more relevant considering the cross-sectional use of social media by different age groups and that children\u2019s exposure to cell phone screens begins at an early age [9].",
              "Later, in adolescence they spend extensive periods on social media due to their socializing with their peers [10,11], whereas university students spend an average of 20 h a week on such digital platforms [12], it has been reported that 98.",

              "It should be noted that users are exposed to different phenomena on social media, such as publicity, images with a positivity bias, and aggressive and violent behaviors.",
              "In addition, the way in which social media operate must be considered as they use technology to filter content based on the users\u2019 previous choice, favoring confirmation bias [16].",
              "They also offer the opportunity to choose with whom one wishes to interact, enabling the formation of groups or communities with similar characteristics [17,18,19], which can foster negativity against what is different, which can be particularly relevant in phenomena such as cyberbullying, which has been linked to time spent on social media [20,21].",
              "Thus, there are also messages on social media that can be potentially harmful when they are about health and personal appearance [22], considering people\u2019s exposure to advertising and photos shared with positivity biases [23,24].",
              "In this sense, exposure to photos that have been manipulated to achieve a positive appearance is associated with reducing body image and body satisfaction, with the increase in the desire of young women to get cosmetic surgery [25], depending on the time spent on the Internet [23].",
              "On the other hand, users can be confronted with demands and difficulties such as the dissemination of false and manipulated news in the post-truth era [1,26], which are produced and put into circulation intentionally to obtain benefits such as more visits by users [27].",
              "This is combined with people sharing information without a review process for this content since positive feedback from other users prevails;",

              "however, it depends on the user\u2019s characteristics and how the different platforms are used [28,29].",
              "As a result, teaching and learning competences for the use of these Internet platforms are particularly relevant since they include social and ethical aspects and technical skills [14], as well as competences that can assess information that aids in better decision-making [30].",

              "It is worth noting that Hobbs [32] refers in particular to media literacy and understands it as knowledge, competences, and skills for life that make it possible to participate in today\u2019s society by accessing, analyzing, evaluating, and creating messages in different ways and in different media, being the result of media education.",

              "Currently, efforts are being made by the international community to guarantee digital literacy [36], because since the COVID-19 pandemic time on the Internet and social media has increased [37].",
              "It is important to mention that digital literacy has been proposed as a strategy against social inequality, given the connection between technological exclusion and wider forms of economic and social exclusion [38], because people have fewer opportunities to develop skills due to their limited Internet connection, thereby reducing participation levels [39].",
              "Another relevant element is that it is linked to socio-economic disadvantage with a lack of knowledge about the algorithms that these types of platforms use to recommend content [40].",
              "Literacy in traditional and digital media is central given that we live permanently receiving messages from different sources [41].",
              "Generally, these are focused on improving people\u2019s competences to integrate and operate in today\u2019s society [42].",
              "Therefore, it is necessary to promote the development of skills such as critical thinking because even though teenagers and young adults have known the world with the Internet, they do not have better developed skills in all the areas that digital literacy addresses [43].",
              "Nevertheless, according to Leaning [35], the difficulty arises because media literacy does not sufficiently address digital technology, considering that digital literacy does not fully develop a critical approach compared to media literacy.",
              "However, it is relevant to point out that the boundaries between the types of literacy can be blurred;",
              "in addition, other proposals progressively emerge that link different approaches such as critical digital literacy, rendering the desired distinctions complex [44,45,46].",
              "In this sense, due to their mass use, social media have transformed the way we relate to each other, form communities, and use mass media.",
              "This has been of interest, with proposals on the issue of literacy being generated that focus particularly on these digital platforms. Therefore, Livingstone [47] indicates the need for literacy focused on social media to update the analysis of media literacy.",
              "Nevertheless, this concept has limited theoretical development and little operationalization [7,48].",
              "In addition, there is evidence that authors define it differently;",
              "it has not been clearly established what the competences are that are included in this type of literacy given the authors working with this concept in their research.",
              "In light of the above, this article focuses on social media literacy by performing a systematic literature review to better understand the concept in terms of the competences it provides that adequately guide efforts in the direction of teaching and learning processes in this area.",
              "The relevance of these processes must be borne in mind due to the mass use of such platforms and their use by people of different ages for extended periods, considering there are dangers in social media while at the same time they afford possibilities for interaction, entertainment, and other options that can be useful with an adequate understanding of how social media work and how to make use of them.",
              "Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze, descriptively, the main definitions and competences of the concept of social media literacy.",

              "Only scientific articles, theoretical and empirical, in English and Spanish between 2010 and 2021 were included.",
              "Exclusion criteria: Articles that address social media from digital literacy without specifically considering the scope of social media literacy were not included, since they do not define the concept, nor do they refer to the competences that social media literacy encompasses.",

              "Theses, conference proceedings, and systematic reviews were not included.",

              "In terms of coverage bias, the different databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed) were reviewed.",
              "With respect to the selection final, the articles were read and reviewed completely, observing if the records provided a conceptual definition of social media literacy or if they reported on the skills that this type of literacy includes.",
              "The other criteria of inclusion and exclusion were also considered.",
              "The standard quality assessment criteria for evaluating primary research papers were also applied [50].",
              "Later, a table was constructed to present the studies, considering first the authors, type of study, objective, and information on the sample.",

              "In relation to the biases present in articles, generally the records describe full data in their results;",
              "moreover, the results were reported according to the analyses used, considering that this is of interest to this review.",
              "Fifteen articles were obtained for analysis from the following countries: Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Indonesia, Singapore, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, it being observed that interest in the concept of social media literacy is concentrated mainly in European countries that develop and contribute theoretical and empirical evidence relating to this concept (Table A1 in Appendix A).",
              "The conceptualization of social media literacy is based on media literacy [51,52,53,54,55,56,57].",
              "However, it is emphasized that social media are oriented to the interpersonal communication that arises from the human need to establish interactions with others [48,52,53].",
              "Thus, according to Vanwynsbergue [56], the focus would be on favoring the efficiency and efficacy of Internet communication, benefitting social relations (Table A1 in Appendix A).",
              "On the other hand, the understanding of the particular characteristics of such platforms is worth noting, in that it is relevant how the information is presented on social media, considering the objectives after posts by both people and advertising, in addition to positivity bias [51,53,54].",
              "Consequently, social media literacy is oriented towards the prevention of risks such as mental and physical health problems [51,53], as well as other types of consequences that can arise from interactions between people, for example cyberbullying, information spreading, and other difficulties [52,53,55].",
              "With respect to the different competences that encompass social media literacy according to the different studies, there is evidence that cognitive competences appear cross-sectionally in most of the studies searched.",
              "These include understanding, analysis, evaluation, synthesis, and the interpretation of the information, added to the assessment of the motive, purpose, realism, and credibility of the publication.",
              "Critical thinking is considered fundamental due to the large volume of information to which social media users are exposed [51,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61].",
              "In addition, according to Schreurs and Vandenbosch [54], cognitive competences include a knowledge of traditional media literacy and the dynamics of interpersonal communication on social media (Table A1 in Appendix A).",
              "Similarly, user-generated information requires that they have knowledge of the implications of sharing personal data and the generation of information considering the digital fingerprint, since this information is used by the social media platforms and shared with other companies, so the user must evaluate what content to share [62].",
              "Likewise, Tandoc et al.",
              "[63] report on the need to raise awareness about the content recommendation algorithms that transform the social media experience.",
              "The technical or practical competences include the ability to create, review, organize and share contents [57,58], access, find information and use functions such as privacy settings [62], create social media accounts and publish photos and images, and make videos and memes [60,63].",
              "These competences fulfill an important role so people of different ages can perform adequately on these digital platforms [51,55,56,57,58,59,60].",
              "On the other hand, the socio-emotional competences are integrated by several authors into the conceptualization of social media literacy because such digital platforms are oriented to the interaction between different people who share content online;",
              "therefore, management strategies for interpersonal communications are relevant [48,51,54,55,56,63].",
              "Festl [48] proposes that the development of social competences is central to social media literacy including participation and moral, communicative, and education competences, consistent with other studies that lend relevance to motivation, attitude, and behavior that people on social media exhibit [55,56].",
              "In addition, Schreurs and Vandenbosch [54] note that effective competences are reflected in the use of adaptive strategies when users are exposed to difficulties on social media, as indicated in Appendix A (Table A1).",
              "The proposals of authors that consider the relevance of the context in which social interactions occur as well as the language used on social media are worthy of note.",
              "Specifically, the differences between the different digital platforms must be taken into account since they have particular ways of operating [55].",
              "Moreover, the sociocultural pragmatics in the different social media must be borne in mind, i.",
              "e., changes in the users\u2019 language, relations, and behavior depending on the different social and cultural contexts that take place on the Internet [57].",
              "This would make it possible to assess the context that could help discern veracity of the information [60], considering the increase in fake news [63].",
              "The objective of this study was to analyze descriptively the main definitions and competences of the concept of social media literacy.",
              "The results yielded 15 studies (Table A1 in Appendix A) that address social media literacy by either conceptualizing it, or by referring to the competences of which it consists.",
              "It should be noted that there are studies that, despite using the concept in their articles, do not develop it, or they use it to talk about another type of literacy without making a suitable distinction on the issue [22,64,65].",
              "In relation to the findings of this study, the construction of the concept of social media literacy is based on the knowledge gained through media literacy, to then integrate elements focused on catching the particularities, characteristics, and implications of social media.",
              "In this context, it is fundamental to consider the social interactions produced on social media, the possibility of users creating content, the large amount of information that circulates on social media that includes user content and publicity from businesses, as well as the content filtering and recommendation technology.",
              "In the same vein, it is suggested that the concept of social media literacy could respond to the requirements of today\u2019s society due to the mass and recurring use of these types of virtual platforms worldwide [47,48,51,52,53,54,55,56].",
              "Consequently, social media literacy is an update of media literacy [47], being oriented to favoring people being able to perform adequately on social media considering the various difficulties that can arise.",
              "Without a doubt, the phenomena that occur on social media are not all negative, rather these digital platforms have benefits that could be taken advantage of better if users have greater knowledge and competences [28].",
              "Thus, access to the benefits or opportunities that social media afford, such as the possibility of sharing with friends and relatives, should be promoted, but with strategies to protect against damaging trends or risky behaviors [54].",
              "Generally, the analyzed studies converge in the relevance of cognitive competences in social media literacy.",
              "It is worth noting the development of critical thinking because most studies mention it being necessary to obtain a suitable understanding and assessment of the content, being aware of the reliability and credibility of the information [55,56,60], reducing the persuasive influence of mass media through the evaluation of the intention and realism of the content [53,61].",
              "This is not an easy task due to the large volume of information and the anonymity of those who produce the content on social media [57].",
              "In this sense, the knowledge about the algorithms with which social media work acquires relevance, presenting information to the user according to their fingerprint [40].",
              "As Livingstone [52] points out, social media literacy is at the intersection between social and mass media, so that the relevance of socio-emotional competences stands out.",
              "The social interactions that take place between users in real time or delay time are one of the characteristics that distinguishes social media from other types of digital platforms or mass media;",
              "therefore, different authors have focused on the socio-emotional competences to conceptualize and operationalize the construct [48,51,52,53,54].",
              "In this way, such competences can be considered a protective factor against cybervictimization [66], and a greater prosocial behavior in Internet activities is implied [67], since there are adaptive strategies against negative experiences [54].",
              "With respect to the technical or practical competences, there is evidence that among these are the ability to access, create, review, and share content on social media, adding other functions such as those linked to privacy settings.",
              "These competences are considered in a general way;",
              "however, social media platforms are different from each other, which is why it is relevant to consider those specific skills that could help people to perform adequately on the different social media.",
              "Coincidently, Manca et al.",
              "[7] refers to a higher skill level that can be cross-sectional on the different social media and skills specific to each digital platform.",
              "Likewise, studies have shown the relevance of the context in which the content is generated in order to assess its construction [55,57,60].",
              "Then, the specific platform can be considered, the context in which differences in the language used and the forms of interaction between users are reflected.",
              "On the other hand, it is important to place social media within a broader social and economic context such as digital capitalism [33], being aware of the objectives of the social media companies such as generating profits [68], transforming the private experience into merchandise [69].",
              "Another finding of this study is the different areas in which studies are being conducted that involve this concept.",
              "On the one hand, evidence shows that different authors work with this concept applied to the area of physical and mental health related to body perception [51,53,61,70], developing interventions to reduce eating disorders and the negative impact of exposure to social media because they show idealized appearances, such that social media literacy is considered a protective factor [24,61].",
              "Meanwhile, another group of authors focuses on research with children and adolescents due to the continuous use of social media as a result of their need to establish relations with their peers and how their families mediate the use of digital platforms [48,52,54,58].",
              "Consequently, the development of competences by teenagers is fundamental for them to operate suitably on social media, considering that parents show deficiencies in technical competences and knowledge of social media because they use them less or they use digital platforms passively [54,58].",
              "Finally, the relevance of the analysis and the assessment of news content on social media to determine its veracity stands out in the current context [5,26,60,63].",
              "In this sense, the contribution of social media literacy is significant since it considers aspects of such platforms, because when sharing information, it prioritizes the expectation of positive feedback from other users, or that the content supports one\u2019s personal beliefs and values.",
              "This systematic review collaborated in the understanding of the construct of social media literacy in its definition and the skills that integrate it, being considered an area of emerging research and that its development is very necessary due to people staying on social media specifically for extended periods.",
              "Social media literacy is focused on the development of different abilities that range from the technical to the socio-emotional.",
              "In this sense, social media, by making possible and favoring social interactions, bring with them requirements for people to perform adequately on digital platforms, understanding that there is no separation between the digital plane and the physical plane;",
              "therefore, a mutual influence is produced that could affect people\u2019s experience by being exposed to the dangers on social media that worsen without the skills to deal with such situations.",
              "On the other hand, the social, economic, cultural, and political context is integrated into the analysis conducted on social media given that such platforms have product advertising, political announcements, and other situations to which social media users are exposed.",
              "At the same time, the social media differ from each other, so it is relevant to visualize the characteristics of each of them and their differences, noting they each have their own culture that is reflected in the language, behavior, and interactions generated.",
              "In terms of the limitations of this study, it should be noted that there may be articles that were not detected in the systematic search, or that were not selected for the analysis considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study because the authors used concepts linked to media and digital literacy to refer to the concept of social media literacy.",
              "Other databases could be added to verify whether there are new articles and integrate them into the results, contributing to different research questions.",
              "Similarly, other types of articles such as systematic reviews or conference proceedings could be added since they were excluded here.",
              "With respect to the future lines of investigation, studies must be generated considering the construct of social media literacy and its relation to other constructs such as cyberbullying and cyberaggression as the dangers of social media are considered, making it possible to observe which competences that make up social media literacy are those that would mainly protect against these dangers.",

              "Bridging-based ranking uses a different set of signals to determine which content gets ranked highly.",
              "One approach is to increase the rank of content that receives positive feedback from people who normally disagree.",

              "Research on bridging-based ranking can draw on this, taking insights from conflict management in the physical world and translating them into digital systems. For example, facilitating contact between people from rival groups in \u201copt in\u201d, non-threatening settings can reduce prejudice, and we can design social platforms to create these conditions online.",

              "This is to enable independent analysis and accountability regarding content visibility, algorithmic and human decision-making and potential biases.",

              "Note from the authors: Given that these recommendations were developed by just 17 participants within a short time frame, some aspects require further development.",

              "In upcoming consultations, we aim to discuss these recommendations with a broader range of stakeholders to refine and enhance these proposals.",
              "Social media discussions around news have become increasingly heated, polarized or at times violent.",
              "However, given their priority to secure their organization\u2019s viability, many media outlets struggle to allot enough time and resources to moderate user generated content.",

              "Journalists from marginalized groups and different genders frequently face online violence, leading to significant consequences for individuals as well as society.",
              "Attacks on social media have prompted many journalists to quit or limit their online presence, or refrain from discussing controversial topics.",
              "In Latin America, for example, 68% of journalists interviewed said that after being attacked, they had posted less frequently, left social media or avoided certain topics (source:UNESCO).",
              "However, it is crucial that marginalized groups and journalists become part of the public dialogue;",
              "this ensures that diverse perspectives are represented, voices are heard, and systemic inequalities and injustices are effectively addressed.",
              "Some governments, especially in the Global South, have made efforts to regulate social media spaces and introduced cyber laws that \u2013 while often claiming the contrary \u2013 aim to silence critical voices online.",
              "In 2022 alone, authorities in Africa shut down the Internet 187 times across 35 countries to suppress citizens' voices (source:Accessnow).",
              "These tendencies restrict freedom of expression and freedom of the media.",
              "When societal voices cannot be heard and journalists can no longer freely report on issues, this not only challenges the freedom of individuals to form opinions but democracy as a whole.",
              "Social media platforms, private actors and governments all play a crucial role in shaping the digital landscape, and each has a responsibility to ensure the protection of freedom of expression and human rights.",
              "However, for meaningful change to come about, it\u2019s essential to find a balance between protecting freedom of expression and regulating harmful content and behavior.",
              "Finding the right approach requires thoughtful consideration of the specific context and potential risks involved.",
              "Moderation approaches need to conform to human rights standards and the rule of law, as alsooutlined by the UN rapporteurs.",
              "For this, we recommend focusing on the following areas: Social media platforms and private actors: Establish local oversight boards: To ensure a more nuanced understanding of cultural contexts and sensitivities, social media platforms and private actors such as Facebook should establish local oversight boards.",
              "These boards should function in a way similar to theexisting Oversight Board but with more powers and responsibilities to effectively address and moderate content based on local perspectives and concerns.",
              "The board's composition is important.",
              "To ensure its credibility, impartiality and a well-rounded decision-making process, it should consist of independent and multistakeholder members.",
              "For this, it is essential to include representatives from diverse backgrounds, such as civil society, academia and human rights organizations.",
              "Invest in local moderation teams that include local language experts: A priority for social media platforms and private actors should be to include, as part of their moderation teams, local language experts with cultural expertise.",
              "These experts can better understand and interpret content in regional languages, accurately assess its context, and make informed unbiased decisions regarding whether content should be permitted or removed.",
              "This is vital for preventing misinterpretations and misjudgements.",
              "To effectively do this, social media platforms must prioritize staffing the teams with enough members and allocate sufficient resources to support their operations.",
              "Transparently disclose information about content moderation teams: For accountability, it is important that social media platforms and private actors are transparent about their moderation teams. This includes providing information about the backgrounds of moderators as well as the tasks and responsibilities assigned to them.",
              "Transparency builds trust and allows users to better understand the decision-making processes behind content moderation, and leads to greater accountability Focus on behavior rather than content: Instead of solely relying on automated content filters, social media platforms and private actors should shift their focus to patterns of conduct, such as harassment, hate speech or coordinated misinformation campaigns, instead of focusing solely on individual pieces of content.",
              "By addressing harmful behaviors in an ongoing form of governance, platforms can create a safer environment while minimizing the potential biases and limitations of automated content moderation (see suggestion by Douek).",
              "This can allow for a more nuanced and adaptable regulation that addresses the root causes of misconduct on social media platforms, while respecting the freedom of expression and diversity of opinions.",
              "Governments: Establish independent governance mechanisms: Governments should prioritize the establishment of independent control mechanisms, such as local and international oversight boards and moderation teams, instead of attempting to directly influence online dialogue.",
              "These independent structures should effectively regulate and moderate social media content while ensuring the transparency, fairness and adherence to guidelines and principles set up by the oversight boards.",
              "Note from the authors: Given that these recommendations were developed by just 17 participants within a short time frame, some aspects require further development.",
              "The following aspects need to be closely reviewed and discussed in upcoming consultations: Which entity/entities should moderate and regulate content?",
              "Who should advise on regulations?",
              "Which bodies should review and decide on submissions made to the platforms?",
              "And (how) can a database of moderation decisions such as the DSA Transparency Database, which collects decisions by social media platforms, be a useful tool for enhancing constructive content moderation and curation?",
              "Internet access remains unevenly distributed worldwide.",
              "Some 57% of the global population (4,388 billion people) has internet access, meaning that nearly half of the global population does not.",
              "The level of connectivity varies significantly among the countries researched by this project.",
