              "Costumes are considered important for stage presence in competition and performance Irish stepdance.",
              "In many cases, costumes are sold at high prices and can even be custom made.",
              "Each costume is different, with varying colors and patterns, designed to attract the judge's eye in competitions and the audience's eye in performance.",
              "General appearance beside the costume is also equally important.",
              "Female dancers would typically curl their hair before each competition or wear curled wigs, while male dancers would neatly style their hair to a shape to their liking.",
              "Poodle Socks are worn by female dancers while males wear plain black socks.",
              "Poodle socks are white socks that stretch to typically 1-4 inches above the ankle, depending on the dancers preference.",
              "They also have distinctive ribbing, and can be embroidered with gems. Riverdance, an Irish step-dancing performance in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest that later became a hugely successful theatrical production, greatly contributed to its popularity.",
              "Once Riverdance became a large production, it changed the way that Irish dance was performed and viewed.",
              "Now that entrepreneurs could capitalize on Irish culture, they were able to tweak it to the audience's liking.",
              "This meant adding a theatrical flair to the performance, including arm movements (as opposed to the previously rigid top half that dancers maintained) as well as sexualizing the dance and the costumes.",
              "To many, this was a betrayal of tradition, but to some, it was a way of expanding Irish culture and became widely accepted.",
              "Following after Riverdance was Lord of the Dance and many other theatrical productions based on Irish stepdance.",
              "Michael Flatley, an Irish stepdancer, became a well-known name within these shows.",
              "Two types of shoes are worn in Irish stepdance;",
              "hard shoes, which make sounds similar to tap shoes, and soft shoes (called Ghillies), which are similar to ballet slippers.",
              "The dances for soft shoe and hard shoe are different and go by different names.",
              "Different music with varying beats are played based on the dance, though each soft and hard shoe dances all share basic moves and rhythms. The dancing traditions of Ireland are likely to have grown in tandem with Irish traditional music.",
              "Its first roots may have been in Pre-Christian Ireland, but Irish dance was also partially influenced by dance forms on the Continent, especially the quadrille dances.",
              "Some of the earliest recorded references to Irish dance are to the Rinnce Fada or \"long dance\", towards the end of the 17th century, which was performed largely on social occasions.",
              "[1] Traveling dancing masters taught all over Ireland beginning around the 1750s and continuing as late as the early 1900s.",
              "[2] By the late 19th century, at least three related styles of step dance had developed in Ireland.",
              "The style practised in Munster saw dancers on the balls of their feet, using intricate percussive techniques to create complex rhythm.",
              "On the other hand, a tradition developed in Ulster saw dancers instead using their heel to create a persistent drumming effect, and primarily performing in pairs.",
              "The Connemara style, later described as sean-no\u0301s dance, combined heel and ball movements with the swaying of the torso and vigorous movement of the arms.[3] The foundation of the Gaelic League in 1893, an Irish nationalist body formed with the purpose of preserving traditional Irish language and culture, radically altered the cultural status of step dance.",
              "Frank Hall has described this as the moment in which \"step-Dancing in Ireland became 'Irish dancing'\", and as therefore the most significant single event in the development of the dance form.",
              "[4] Although informal competitions had long been held between towns and students of different dance masters, the first organised feis was held in 1897 by the League.",
              "[5] The League began to codify and promote the form of step dance which was practiced in southern areas.",
              "[2] This codification, practised from the early 1920s, greatly narrowed the range of traditional Irish dances acceptable in popular culture.",
              "[6] In 1927, the Gaelic League set up An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha (CLRG, the Irish Dancing Commission), a separate body dedicated to the organisation and standardisation of Irish dance.",
              "CLRG created certifications for dance teachers and began to hold examinations for adjudicators of feisanna.",
              "In the 19th century, the Irish diaspora had spread Irish dance all over the world, especially to North America and Australia.",
              "However, schools and feiseanna were not established until the early 1900s: in America these tended to be created within Irish-American urban communities, notably in Chicago and Massachusetts.",
              "The first classes in stepdancing were held there by the Philadelphia-born John McNamara.",
              "[7] According to the BBC's A Short History of Irish Dance, \"The nature of the Irish dance tradition has changed and adapted over the centuries to accommodate and reflect changing populations and the fusion of new cultures.",
              "The history of Irish dancing is as a result a fascinating one.",
              "The popular Irish dance stage shows of the past ten years have reinvigorated this cultural art, and today Irish dancing is healthy, vibrant, and enjoyed by people across the globe.\"",
              "[8] The first television broadcast of Irish stepdance, on CBS in 1945, contributed to the increased popularity of a stepdance style originating in Ulster.",
              "This style, which incorporated balletic movements and high elevation on the toes, gradually usurped the Munster style with fast, low footwork which had prevailed up to that point.",
              "[9] The success of Riverdance and other dance shows in the late 20th century influenced the choreography and presentation of stepdance in both competitive and public performance environments.",
              "This included the use of simpler costumes and hairstyles for public performance in imitation of the Riverdance styles, and the development of new dance styles, such as hard shoe dances performed to music typically associated with soft shoes.",
              "[10] In competitive dance, movements from flamenco and figure skating began to be incorporated into traditional steps, although such developments were criticised by elements of the competitive dancing community.",
              "[11] The techniques involved in Irish stepdance are essentially similar across each of the individual dance styles.",
              "The basic style of modern step dance used in competitive contexts evolved from the stylistic features of traditional step dance in Munster.",
              "This style is largely performed on the balls of the feet with feet turned outwards.",
              "[12] Competitive dancers are judged on posture, timing, rhythm and execution, which in practice means a rigid torso, rapid and intricate footwork, and legs and feet crossed over each other, with knees close together.",
              "[13] Irish stepdances can be placed into two categories.",
              "Solos, which are danced by a single dancer, and ceilis or teams, which are coordinated with 2 or more dancers.",
              "Reel, slip jig, hornpipe, and jig are all types of Irish stepdances and are also types of Irish traditional music.",
              "These fall into two broad categories based on the shoes worn: 'hard shoe' and 'soft shoe' dances.",
              "Reels, which are in 24 or 44 time, and slip jigs, which are in 98 time and considered to be the lightest and most graceful of the dances, are soft shoe dances.",
              "[14][15] Hornpipes, which can be in 24 or 44 time, are danced in hard shoes.",
              "Three jigs are danced in competition;",
              "the light jig, the single jig, which is also called the Hop jig, and the treble jig, which is also called double jig.",
              "Light and single jigs are in 68 time, and are soft shoes dances, while the treble jig is hard shoe, danced in a slow 68.",
              "The last type of jig is the slip jig, which is danced in 98 time.",
              "There are many dances, which steps vary between schools.",
              "The traditional set dances (danced in hardshoe) like St.",
              "Patrick's Day and the Blackbird, among others, are the only dances that all schools have the same steps.",
              "The actual steps in Irish stepdance are usually unique to each school or dance teacher.",
              "Steps are developed by Irish dance teachers for students of their school.",
              "Each dance is built out of the same basic elements, or steps, but the dance itself is unique, and new dances and movements are being choreographed continuously.",
              "For this reason, videotaping of competitions is forbidden under the rules of An Coimisiun.",
              "Each step is a sequence of foot movements, leg movements and leaps, which lasts for 8 repetitions of 8 bars of music.",
              "It is traditional for each step to be performed first on the right foot and then on the left foot, then transferring to the next step.",
              "This practice leads to a large proportion of dancers exhibiting a preference for their right leg over their left in dance movements.",
              "[16] Hard shoe dancing includes clicking (striking the heels of the shoes against each other), trebles (the toe of the shoe striking the floor), stamps (the entire foot striking the floor), and an increasing number of complicated combinations of taps from the toes and heels.",
              "There are two types of hard shoe dance, the solo dances, which are the hornpipe and treble jig, and the set dances, which are also solo dances, despite having the same name as the social dances.",
              "Traditional set dances use the same choreography regardless of the school whereas contemporary sets are choreographed by the teachers.",
              "The music and steps for each traditional set was set down by past dance masters and passed down under An Coimisiu\u0301n auspices as part of the rich history of stepdancing, hence the \"traditional.\"",
              "There are about 40 sets used in modern stepdance, but the traditional sets performed in most levels of competition are St.",
              "Patrick's Day, the Blackbird, Job of Journeywork, Garden of Daisies, King of the Fairies, and Jockey to the Fair.",
              "The remaining traditional set dances are primarily danced at championship levels.",
              "These tunes vary in tempo to allow for more difficult steps for higher level dancers.",
              "An unusual feature of the set dance tune is that many are \"crooked\", with some of the parts, or sections, of the tunes departing from the common 8 bar formula.",
              "The crooked tune may have a part consisting of 71\u20442 bars, fourteen bars, etc.",
              "For example, the \"St.",
              "Patrick's Day\" traditional set music consists of an eight-bar \"step,\" followed by a fourteen-bar \"set.\"",
              "The group dances are called ce\u0301ili\u0301 dances or, in the less formal but common case, figure dances.",
              "Competitive ce\u0301ili\u0301s are more precise versions of the festive group dances traditionally experienced in social gatherings.",
              "There is a list of 30 ce\u0301ili\u0301 dances that have been standardised and published in An Coimisiun's Ar Rince Ceili (which replaced A\u0301r Rinncidhe Foirne in 2015)[17] as examples of traditional Irish folk dances.",
              "Standardized dances for 4, 6 or 8 dancers are also often found in competition.",
              "Most traditional ce\u0301ili\u0301 dances in competition are significantly shortened in the interests of time.",
              "Many stepdancers never learn the entire dance, as they will never dance the later parts of the dance in competition.",
              "Other ce\u0301ili\u0301 dances are not standardised.",
              "In local competition, figure dances may consist of two or three dancers.",
              "These are not traditional book dances and are choreographed as a blend of both traditional ce\u0301ili\u0301 dancing and solo dancing.",
              "Standardized book dances for 16 dancers are also rarely offered.",
              "Figure Choreography competitions held at major oireachtasai (championships) involve more than 8 dancers and are a chance for dance schools to show off novel and intricate group choreography.",
              "An Coimisiu\u0301n has also introduced a \"dance drama\" category, which combines physical theatre with Irish dance.",
              "A 200-word story is read and followed by a six-minute dance performance including costumes, mime and facial expression.",
              "[18] Some dance schools recognised by An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha place as much emphasis on ce\u0301ili\u0301 dancing as on solo dancing, meticulously rehearsing the dances as written in the book and striving for perfect interpretation.",
              "In competition, figure dancers are expected to dance their routine in perfect unison, forming seamless yet intricate figures based on their positions relative to each other.",
              "The development of Irish stepdance costumes occurred throughout the 20th century alongside the dance style itself.",
              "Costumes were thus heavily influenced by the rules and competitive structures put in place by An Coimisiu\u0301n and other organisations.",
              "In more recent years, costumes changed dramatically and departed significantly from traditional designs.",
              "[19] Judges at competitions critique the dancers primarily on their performance, but they also take into account presentation.",
              "In every level of competition the dancers must wear either hard shoes or soft shoes.",
              "Boys and girls wear very distinctive costumes.",
              "Girls must wear white poodle socks or black tights.",

              "Costumes can be simple for the beginning female dancer;",
              "they often wear a simple dance skirt and plain blouse or their dancing school's costume.",
              "The certain colours and emblem that are used on the dresses represents the dance school to differentiate it from other dance schools.",
              "These are similar to a solo dress, but are simple with only a few colours, while are still more pounds, depending on the fabric, and may require some getting used to.",
              "School costumes are not decorated with crystals.",
              "At advanced levels where dancers can qualify for Major competitions, solo costumes help each dancer show their sense of style, and enable them to stand out among a crowd.",
              "The dancers can have a new solo costume specially tailored for them with their choice of colours, fabrics, and designs.",
              "Popular designers include Gavin Doherty, Conor O\u2019Sullivan, and Elevation.",
              "Some dancers will even design the costume themselves.",
              "The dancer can also buy second hand from another dancer.",
              "Since the costumes are handmade with pricey materials, unique designs, and are measured to each dancer's body type, the costumes can cost between $1000 and $6,000.",
              "Along with having the handcrafted costumes, championship commission dancers have wigs and crowns.",
              "In commission schools female dancers wear a wig, as wigs are convenient and popular.",
              "Dancers get synthetic ringlet wigs that match their hair color or go with an extremely different shade (a blonde dancer wearing a black wig or vice versa).",
              "The wigs can range from $75.",
              "00 to $150.",
              "Usually the crowns match the colours and materials of the dresses, and are made of fabric or metal.",
              "The championship competitions are usually danced on stages with a lot of lighting.",
              "To prevent looking washed out, and to enhance their leg muscles, dancers often tan their legs.",
              "A rule was put in place in January 2005 for Under 10 dancers forbidding them to wear fake tan, and in October 2005 it was decided that Under 12 dancers who were in the Beginner and Primary levels would not be allowed to wear fake tan or make up.",
              "The boys used to wear jackets and kilts, but now more commonly perform in black trousers with a colorful vest or jacket and tie and, more frequently, a vest with embroidery and crystals.",
              "The festival style differs, styling more towards a simple unified design, not using much detail or diamonds.",
              "Irish dance festivals (also called \"shows\") have dancers wear their hair either in a wig or down, depending on the age and level of the dancer.",
              "Three types of shoes are worn in competitive step dancing: hard shoes and two kinds of soft shoe.",
              "Hard shoes, also known as the heavy shoes or jig shoes, are leather shoes in the style of an Oxford shoe but with a toe piece similar to the cleat on a tap shoe as well an extended heel, both of which enable the production of rhythmic sounds.",
              "[20] Early 20th century dancers used a variety of shoes, including both those made of cowhide, which minimised sound production, and hobnail boots, which produced loud percussive sounds.",
              "[21] At this time, it was common for women to perform jigs and hornpipes in ordinary lightweight shoes, because their dances did not involve rhythmic percussion, but from the 1930s onward both men and women began to wear heavy leather shoes.",
              "[22] Although in Ireland, hard shoes were used only for heavy jigs and hornpipes, in Australia until the 1950s it was common practice to perform all dances in such heavy shoes.",
              "[23] After An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rince Gaelacha banned the use of metal heel or toe pieces in the 1940s, ordinary shoes were modified with nails, coins or gravel in order to improve the clarity of sound and to emphasise the rhythms of the heavy dances.",
              "[22][24] At this time, it was also common for heel and toe pieces to be improvised with several layers of leather stitched together in a tapered shape.",
              "[25] From the 1980s, toe pieces and heels were developed made from fibreglass or plastics, in response to lighter shoe leather with inferior sound production qualities, and with the aim of minimising damage caused to floors by nails.",
              "The lightweight nature of such materials allowed dancers to achieve more elevation in their steps,[20] and furthermore enabled entirely new movements to be incorporated into dances, such as pointe work in the balletic style on the very tip of the toe piece.",
              "A further innovation, the \"bubble heel\", which added an inwards protrusion to the hollow plastic heel, created a far louder sound when clicking the heels together than was possible in traditional leather-heeled shoes.",
              "[26] An Coimisiu\u0301n later outlawed bubble heels in competition, but plastic heels continued to enable \"click\" movements.",
              "Dancing en pointe was popularised further by the introduction of shoes with modified, more flexible soles.",
              "[26][27] The sound production qualities of shoes were further augmented by the radio microphones built into the toe for shows such as Riverdance.",
              "[28] At the end of the 20th century, a further development occurred in shoe design: the \"flexi\" sole, which removed the rigid \"spine\" from the base of the shoe, in an attempt to enable greater flexibility in the feet.",
              "However, concerns were raised by dance regulators that the lack of support would have an adverse impact on dancers' feet.",
              "[28] , in the shape of a shamrock or other It is common for an intricate but entirely cosmetic buckle to be added to hard shoes for competition.",
              "[29] Commercially available hard shoes are priced at between US$100 and $150.",
              "[30] Until the early 20th century, reels and slip jigs were performed in ordinary walking shoes, as with heavy jigs and hornpipes.",
              "Beginning at the dancing competition of the 1924 Tailteann Games in Dublin, a style of ballet pump held on by a looped piece of elastic was introduced for these dances.",
              "The increased popularity of these shoes over the following decades contributed to a more balletic style in the slip jig which eventually led to this dance being performed exclusively by women.",
              "[31] In the latter half of the 20th century, the pumps changed to a low cut type with crossed laces similar to the Scottish ghillie.",
              "This modern type of shoe, however, differs from the traditional Scottish footwear with a shorter toe box and round laces.",
              "A number of variations on this type are available, including variants with softer leather and split soles.",
              "[29] This change was motivated by a desire to highlight the position of feet to adjudicators, as the usual black colour of the pumps contrasted with the exposed white of the poodle socks.",
              "[31] The flexible nature of these shoes enables rapid and graceful movement as well as elevation in the dancer's performance.",
              "[20] These soft shoes cost around $40 when purchased new.",
              "[30] Until the 1970s, it was common for men to wear the pumps as well, particularly when competing in the slip jig, but at this time, An Coimisiu\u0301n introduced legislation restricting their use to boys under the age of 11.",
              "Consequently, a new style of shoe was adopted for men similar to the contemporary hard shoe, with the toe piece and ankle strap removed but the fibreglass heel retained.",
              "[32] This second type of soft shoe, often known as the \"reel shoe\", is worn exclusively by male dancers, although younger male dancers are occasionally encouraged to begin in jazz shoes which are similar apart from the heel.",
              "[29] From the late 1800s, when the Gaelic League began to organise cultural festivals to promote the cause of Irish nationalism, Irish step dance developed a competitive element.",
              "Throughout the 20th century, structures for competition developed and spread across the world.",
              "Several organisations, many of which at various stages separated from the Gaelic League's An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, independently organise Irish dancing competitions, both in Ireland and elsewhere.",
              "In addition to An Coimisiu\u0301n, Irish step dance is regulated by An Comhdha\u0301il na Mu\u0301inteoiri\u0301 le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, Cumann Rince Na\u0301isiu\u0301nta, the World Irish Dance Association, the Festival Irish Dance Teachers Association, and others.",
              "[33] A number of smaller organisations are described as \"open platform\", meaning that dancers and teachers may affiliate with and compete under other open platform organisations.",
              "Open platform organisations also adhere to broad mission statements rather than strict hierarchy, in an attempt to appeal to dance teachers wishing to remain independent.",
              "[33] An Coimisiu\u0301n and An Comhdha\u0301il are primarily closed to competitors from other organisations, but operate open platform competitions in areas with fewer members.",
              "[34] Irish step dance organisations generally require their teachers and adjudicators to be qualified by the governing body.",
              "Most follow the structure set by An Coimisiu\u0301n, the most important qualifications of which are the TCRG (qualification to teach) and the ADCRG (qualification to adjudicate).",
              "These qualifications are awarded by examinations which test practical and theoretical knowledge of traditional and original steps for both step dance and ceili dancing.",
              "[35][36] An Comhdha\u0301il and some other organisations recognise the qualifications awarded by An Coimisiu\u0301n,[37] but An Coimisiu\u0301n only recognises teachers and adjudicators qualified under their own examinations.",
              "[38] A feis (/\u02c8f\u025b\u0283/, plural feiseanna) is a competitive step dance event.",
              "The word \"feis\" means \"festival\" in Irish, and traditionally consists of dancing competitions as well as competition in music and traditional crafts.",
              "Many modern feiseanna, however, are solely Irish dancing events.",
              "[39] At a feis, several grades of competition are typically offered, in accordance with regional practice and the rules of the governing organisation.",
              "These grades may be based on a dancer's level of experience or their previous results in feiseanna.",
              "[40] A feis competition is generally judged by between one and three adjudicators, depending on the size of the event and local organisation rules.",
              "Dancers compete in sections of one solo dance at a time, and feiseanna may also include competitions for ceili dances.",
              "An oireachtas (plural oireachtais or oireachtasi) or championship competition is a larger and usually annual Irish dancing competition.",
              "The first oireachtas, established by the Gaelic League, was inspired by the Welsh eisteddfod and was conceived as an Irish national festival.",
              "[41] An oireachtas is often the highest-level competition for a region or country, such as Oireachtas Rince Na hEirann (The All-Ireland Championships) or the North American Irish Dancing Championships.",
              "Oireachtais operate at only one level of competition and are judged by multiple adjudicators.",
              "In An Coimisiu\u0301n oireachtais, dancers perform three dances in consecutive rounds and are placed according to their cumulative scores.",
              "Like feiseanna, oireachtais may include competitions for ceili dances.",
              "[42] Many of the larger organisations operate an annual World Championships for their organisation's dancers.",
              "[33] The largest and oldest of these is An Coimisiu\u0301n's Oireachtas Rince Na Cruinne, which was established in 1970, and involves up to 3000 competing dancers who have qualified at regional and national oireachtais.",
              "[42] At the 1897 general meeting of the Gaelic League, displays of dancing were observed to be more popular than the speeches and debates.",
              "The public performance of step dance, therefore, evolved with the organisation of social dances as a means for the Gaelic League to ensure both ongoing popularity and financial stability for its revolutionary activities.",
              "[43] Riverdance was the interval act in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest, held in Dublin, which contributed to the popularity of Irish stepdance, and is still considered a significant watershed in Irish culture.",
              "[44] Its roots are in a three-part suite of baroque-influenced traditional music called \"Timedance\", composed and recorded for the 1981 contest, which was also hosted in Dublin.",
              "This first performance featured American-born Irish dancing champions Jean Butler and Michael Flatley, the RTE\u0301 Concert Orchestra and the Celtic choral group Anu\u0301na with a score written by Bill Whelan.",

              "Traditional Irish Step Dancing is considered to be one of the parent dance forms of Appalachian Clogging.",
              "The corpus of Irish Dance contains both soft shoe dances (the reel, the light-jig, and the slip-jig) as well as hard shoe dances which are percussive (the hornpipe, the treble-jig, and the traditional set dances).",
              "A major contributing factor to the evolution of step dancing in the American South was the in-migration of the Ulster-Scots from Ireland in the late 1700s and early 1800s.",
              "After migrating to North America, the Ulster-Scots became particularly concentrated in the Appalachian foothills.",
              "A composite population, the Ulster-Scots, also known as Scotch-Irish, consisted of people with English and Scottish backgrounds who settled in the Ulster region of Ireland.",
              "The dance forms from this part of Ireland most likely bore cultural trademarks from Irish, English, and Scottish traditional dances.",
              "In the 18th century, dance teachers known as the \u201cTraveling Dancing Masters\u201d journeyed around Ireland, teaching students Irish dance steps and technique.",
              "These Dancing Masters are thought to have taught their pupils the \u201ctraditional set dances.",
              "\u201d The St.",
              "Patrick\u2019s Day dance is one of these traditional dances.",
              "As the footwork of the Ulster-Scots intermingled with the dance styles from the early Native American and African American communities, the technique went through an adaptation process which ultimately led to a blending of stylized percussive footwork, which is exhibited in clogging, and has evolved from casual dancing patterns to sophisticated performance contexts.",
              "A common event where dancing was taught and performed was the ce\u0300ilidh.",
              "Ce\u0300ilidhs were casual, community events where friends and neighbors would gather in someone\u2019s home, barn, or church hall and participate in the local expressive culture.",
              "Ce\u0300ilidhs usually featured cooking, music-making, story-telling, and of course dancing.",
              "The early ce\u0300ilidhs were similar in nature to a \u201choe-down\u201d and revolved around the family, neighbors, and the home.",
              "They were a primary activity that brought the community members together to celebrate their heritage, their culture, and their traditions.",
              "Prior to formal dance classes, children often learned to dance from their parents or their friends.",
              "Dancing was ordinary and commonplace, and the home played an integral part in dance transmission.",
              "Though it is most likely that the entire family participated in dancing to some degree in its initial stages, currently female dancers make up a large constituent of the contemporary Irish Dance field.",

              "These peoples spread over Western Europe including France, Northern Spain, and the British Isles, spreading to Ireland in the 3rd century BC.",
              "Saint Patrick introduced Christianity into the country in the 5th century AD.",

              "The Viking raids during the 10th century destroyed most of the books in existence;",
              "however, it is certain that music and dance played an important part in the Gaelic culture.",
              "The Traditional Irish culture continued through the Middle Ages when dances were once again recorded.",
              "It is not clear whose dances influenced whom among the Irish, English and French, but it is characteristic that the Irish dances had a faster tempo.",
              "Irish dance and culture continued to evolve and in the mid 1700's, Dance Masters began the tradition of traveling village to village teaching the various dance steps they had created.",
              "It is from these teachers that the current day Irish set and ceili dances originated.",
              "The four basic types of modern day Irish music and associated dances are the jig, reel, hornpipe and the set dances.",
              "The jig, which was referenced in ancient Ireland, has several variations including the single jig and slip jig.",
              "The slip jig is the most graceful of the Irish dances and features light hopping, sliding and skipping.",
              "Only women dance the slip jig.",
              "Jig music is 6/8 time;",
              "slip jigs are in 9/8 time.",

              "Women perform it as a light, rapid soft shoe dance that often includes leaping and always demands a high level of energy.",
              "Men usually dance the reel in hard shoes.",
              "Reel music is in 4/4 time and is usually danced to a fast tempo.",

              "The hornpipe also began in the mid 1700's and evolved from English stage acts.",
              "It was originally danced exclusively by men, but now, both men and women perform this dance.",
              "The hornpipe is in 4/4 time and is similar to a slow reel but has accents on the first and third beat.",
              "Set dances are performed by individual dancers to a specific tune with each set dance having its own tune.",
              "Some of the tunes are more than 250 years old.",

              "Poodle socks are white socks that stretch to typically 1-4 inches above the ankle, depending on the dancers preference.",
              "They also have distinctive ribbing, and can be embroidered with gems. Riverdance, an Irish step-dancing performance in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest that later became a hugely successful theatrical production, greatly contributed to its popularity.",
              "Once Riverdance became a large production, it changed the way that Irish dance was performed and viewed.",
              "Now that entrepreneurs could capitalize on Irish culture, they were able to tweak it to the audience's liking.",
              "This meant adding a theatrical flair to the performance, including arm movements (as opposed to the previously rigid top half that dancers maintained) as well as sexualizing the dance and the costumes.",
              "To many, this was a betrayal of tradition, but to some, it was a way of expanding Irish culture and became widely accepted.",

              "Different music with varying beats are played based on the dance, though each soft and hard shoe dances all share basic moves and rhythms. The dancing traditions of Ireland are likely to have grown in tandem with Irish traditional music.",
              "Its first roots may have been in Pre-Christian Ireland, but Irish dance was also partially influenced by dance forms on the Continent, especially the quadrille dances.",
              "Some of the earliest recorded references to Irish dance are to the Rinnce Fada or \"long dance\", towards the end of the 17th century, which was performed largely on social occasions.",
              "[1] Traveling dancing masters taught all over Ireland beginning around the 1750s and continuing as late as the early 1900s.",
              "[2] By the late 19th century, at least three related styles of step dance had developed in Ireland.",
              "The style practised in Munster saw dancers on the balls of their feet, using intricate percussive techniques to create complex rhythm.",
              "On the other hand, a tradition developed in Ulster saw dancers instead using their heel to create a persistent drumming effect, and primarily performing in pairs.",
              "The Connemara style, later described as sean-no\u0301s dance, combined heel and ball movements with the swaying of the torso and vigorous movement of the arms.[3] The foundation of the Gaelic League in 1893, an Irish nationalist body formed with the purpose of preserving traditional Irish language and culture, radically altered the cultural status of step dance.",
              "Frank Hall has described this as the moment in which \"step-Dancing in Ireland became 'Irish dancing'\", and as therefore the most significant single event in the development of the dance form.",
              "[4] Although informal competitions had long been held between towns and students of different dance masters, the first organised feis was held in 1897 by the League.",
              "[5] The League began to codify and promote the form of step dance which was practiced in southern areas.",
              "[2] This codification, practised from the early 1920s, greatly narrowed the range of traditional Irish dances acceptable in popular culture.",
              "[6] In 1927, the Gaelic League set up An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha (CLRG, the Irish Dancing Commission), a separate body dedicated to the organisation and standardisation of Irish dance.",
              "CLRG created certifications for dance teachers and began to hold examinations for adjudicators of feisanna.",
              "In the 19th century, the Irish diaspora had spread Irish dance all over the world, especially to North America and Australia.",
              "However, schools and feiseanna were not established until the early 1900s: in America these tended to be created within Irish-American urban communities, notably in Chicago and Massachusetts.",
              "The first classes in stepdancing were held there by the Philadelphia-born John McNamara.",

              "[8] The first television broadcast of Irish stepdance, on CBS in 1945, contributed to the increased popularity of a stepdance style originating in Ulster.",
              "This style, which incorporated balletic movements and high elevation on the toes, gradually usurped the Munster style with fast, low footwork which had prevailed up to that point.",
              "[9] The success of Riverdance and other dance shows in the late 20th century influenced the choreography and presentation of stepdance in both competitive and public performance environments.",
              "This included the use of simpler costumes and hairstyles for public performance in imitation of the Riverdance styles, and the development of new dance styles, such as hard shoe dances performed to music typically associated with soft shoes.",
              "[10] In competitive dance, movements from flamenco and figure skating began to be incorporated into traditional steps, although such developments were criticised by elements of the competitive dancing community.",
              "[11] The techniques involved in Irish stepdance are essentially similar across each of the individual dance styles.",
              "The basic style of modern step dance used in competitive contexts evolved from the stylistic features of traditional step dance in Munster.",
              "This style is largely performed on the balls of the feet with feet turned outwards.",
              "[12] Competitive dancers are judged on posture, timing, rhythm and execution, which in practice means a rigid torso, rapid and intricate footwork, and legs and feet crossed over each other, with knees close together.",
              "[13] Irish stepdances can be placed into two categories.",
              "Solos, which are danced by a single dancer, and ceilis or teams, which are coordinated with 2 or more dancers.",
              "Reel, slip jig, hornpipe, and jig are all types of Irish stepdances and are also types of Irish traditional music.",

              "Reels, which are in 24 or 44 time, and slip jigs, which are in 98 time and considered to be the lightest and most graceful of the dances, are soft shoe dances.",
              "[14][15] Hornpipes, which can be in 24 or 44 time, are danced in hard shoes.",
              "Three jigs are danced in competition;",

              "Steps are developed by Irish dance teachers for students of their school.",
              "Each dance is built out of the same basic elements, or steps, but the dance itself is unique, and new dances and movements are being choreographed continuously.",
              "For this reason, videotaping of competitions is forbidden under the rules of An Coimisiun.",
              "Each step is a sequence of foot movements, leg movements and leaps, which lasts for 8 repetitions of 8 bars of music.",
              "It is traditional for each step to be performed first on the right foot and then on the left foot, then transferring to the next step.",
              "This practice leads to a large proportion of dancers exhibiting a preference for their right leg over their left in dance movements.",
              "[16] Hard shoe dancing includes clicking (striking the heels of the shoes against each other), trebles (the toe of the shoe striking the floor), stamps (the entire foot striking the floor), and an increasing number of complicated combinations of taps from the toes and heels.",
              "There are two types of hard shoe dance, the solo dances, which are the hornpipe and treble jig, and the set dances, which are also solo dances, despite having the same name as the social dances.",
              "Traditional set dances use the same choreography regardless of the school whereas contemporary sets are choreographed by the teachers.",
              "The music and steps for each traditional set was set down by past dance masters and passed down under An Coimisiu\u0301n auspices as part of the rich history of stepdancing, hence the \"traditional.\"",
              "There are about 40 sets used in modern stepdance, but the traditional sets performed in most levels of competition are St.",
              "Patrick's Day, the Blackbird, Job of Journeywork, Garden of Daisies, King of the Fairies, and Jockey to the Fair.",
              "The remaining traditional set dances are primarily danced at championship levels.",
              "These tunes vary in tempo to allow for more difficult steps for higher level dancers.",
              "An unusual feature of the set dance tune is that many are \"crooked\", with some of the parts, or sections, of the tunes departing from the common 8 bar formula.",

              "Most traditional ce\u0301ili\u0301 dances in competition are significantly shortened in the interests of time.",
              "Many stepdancers never learn the entire dance, as they will never dance the later parts of the dance in competition.",
              "Other ce\u0301ili\u0301 dances are not standardised.",
              "In local competition, figure dances may consist of two or three dancers.",

              "In competition, figure dancers are expected to dance their routine in perfect unison, forming seamless yet intricate figures based on their positions relative to each other.",
              "The development of Irish stepdance costumes occurred throughout the 20th century alongside the dance style itself.",
              "Costumes were thus heavily influenced by the rules and competitive structures put in place by An Coimisiu\u0301n and other organisations.",

              "Irish dance festivals (also called \"shows\") have dancers wear their hair either in a wig or down, depending on the age and level of the dancer.",
              "Three types of shoes are worn in competitive step dancing: hard shoes and two kinds of soft shoe.",
              "Hard shoes, also known as the heavy shoes or jig shoes, are leather shoes in the style of an Oxford shoe but with a toe piece similar to the cleat on a tap shoe as well an extended heel, both of which enable the production of rhythmic sounds.",
              "[20] Early 20th century dancers used a variety of shoes, including both those made of cowhide, which minimised sound production, and hobnail boots, which produced loud percussive sounds.",
              "[21] At this time, it was common for women to perform jigs and hornpipes in ordinary lightweight shoes, because their dances did not involve rhythmic percussion, but from the 1930s onward both men and women began to wear heavy leather shoes.",
              "[22] Although in Ireland, hard shoes were used only for heavy jigs and hornpipes, in Australia until the 1950s it was common practice to perform all dances in such heavy shoes.",
              "[23] After An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rince Gaelacha banned the use of metal heel or toe pieces in the 1940s, ordinary shoes were modified with nails, coins or gravel in order to improve the clarity of sound and to emphasise the rhythms of the heavy dances.",
              "[22][24] At this time, it was also common for heel and toe pieces to be improvised with several layers of leather stitched together in a tapered shape.",
              "[25] From the 1980s, toe pieces and heels were developed made from fibreglass or plastics, in response to lighter shoe leather with inferior sound production qualities, and with the aim of minimising damage caused to floors by nails.",
              "The lightweight nature of such materials allowed dancers to achieve more elevation in their steps,[20] and furthermore enabled entirely new movements to be incorporated into dances, such as pointe work in the balletic style on the very tip of the toe piece.",
              "A further innovation, the \"bubble heel\", which added an inwards protrusion to the hollow plastic heel, created a far louder sound when clicking the heels together than was possible in traditional leather-heeled shoes.",
              "[26] An Coimisiu\u0301n later outlawed bubble heels in competition, but plastic heels continued to enable \"click\" movements.",
              "Dancing en pointe was popularised further by the introduction of shoes with modified, more flexible soles.",
              "[26][27] The sound production qualities of shoes were further augmented by the radio microphones built into the toe for shows such as Riverdance.",
              "[28] At the end of the 20th century, a further development occurred in shoe design: the \"flexi\" sole, which removed the rigid \"spine\" from the base of the shoe, in an attempt to enable greater flexibility in the feet.",
              "However, concerns were raised by dance regulators that the lack of support would have an adverse impact on dancers' feet.",
              "[28] , in the shape of a shamrock or other It is common for an intricate but entirely cosmetic buckle to be added to hard shoes for competition.",
              "[29] Commercially available hard shoes are priced at between US$100 and $150.",
              "[30] Until the early 20th century, reels and slip jigs were performed in ordinary walking shoes, as with heavy jigs and hornpipes.",
              "Beginning at the dancing competition of the 1924 Tailteann Games in Dublin, a style of ballet pump held on by a looped piece of elastic was introduced for these dances.",
              "The increased popularity of these shoes over the following decades contributed to a more balletic style in the slip jig which eventually led to this dance being performed exclusively by women.",
              "[31] In the latter half of the 20th century, the pumps changed to a low cut type with crossed laces similar to the Scottish ghillie.",
              "This modern type of shoe, however, differs from the traditional Scottish footwear with a shorter toe box and round laces.",
              "A number of variations on this type are available, including variants with softer leather and split soles.",
              "[29] This change was motivated by a desire to highlight the position of feet to adjudicators, as the usual black colour of the pumps contrasted with the exposed white of the poodle socks.",
              "[31] The flexible nature of these shoes enables rapid and graceful movement as well as elevation in the dancer's performance.",
              "[20] These soft shoes cost around $40 when purchased new.",
              "[30] Until the 1970s, it was common for men to wear the pumps as well, particularly when competing in the slip jig, but at this time, An Coimisiu\u0301n introduced legislation restricting their use to boys under the age of 11.",
              "Consequently, a new style of shoe was adopted for men similar to the contemporary hard shoe, with the toe piece and ankle strap removed but the fibreglass heel retained.",
              "[32] This second type of soft shoe, often known as the \"reel shoe\", is worn exclusively by male dancers, although younger male dancers are occasionally encouraged to begin in jazz shoes which are similar apart from the heel.",
              "[29] From the late 1800s, when the Gaelic League began to organise cultural festivals to promote the cause of Irish nationalism, Irish step dance developed a competitive element.",
              "Throughout the 20th century, structures for competition developed and spread across the world.",
              "Several organisations, many of which at various stages separated from the Gaelic League's An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, independently organise Irish dancing competitions, both in Ireland and elsewhere.",
              "In addition to An Coimisiu\u0301n, Irish step dance is regulated by An Comhdha\u0301il na Mu\u0301inteoiri\u0301 le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, Cumann Rince Na\u0301isiu\u0301nta, the World Irish Dance Association, the Festival Irish Dance Teachers Association, and others.",
              "[33] A number of smaller organisations are described as \"open platform\", meaning that dancers and teachers may affiliate with and compete under other open platform organisations.",
              "Open platform organisations also adhere to broad mission statements rather than strict hierarchy, in an attempt to appeal to dance teachers wishing to remain independent.",
              "[33] An Coimisiu\u0301n and An Comhdha\u0301il are primarily closed to competitors from other organisations, but operate open platform competitions in areas with fewer members.",
              "[34] Irish step dance organisations generally require their teachers and adjudicators to be qualified by the governing body.",
              "Most follow the structure set by An Coimisiu\u0301n, the most important qualifications of which are the TCRG (qualification to teach) and the ADCRG (qualification to adjudicate).",
              "These qualifications are awarded by examinations which test practical and theoretical knowledge of traditional and original steps for both step dance and ceili dancing.",
              "[35][36] An Comhdha\u0301il and some other organisations recognise the qualifications awarded by An Coimisiu\u0301n,[37] but An Coimisiu\u0301n only recognises teachers and adjudicators qualified under their own examinations.",
              "[38] A feis (/\u02c8f\u025b\u0283/, plural feiseanna) is a competitive step dance event.",
              "The word \"feis\" means \"festival\" in Irish, and traditionally consists of dancing competitions as well as competition in music and traditional crafts.",
              "Many modern feiseanna, however, are solely Irish dancing events.",
              "[39] At a feis, several grades of competition are typically offered, in accordance with regional practice and the rules of the governing organisation.",
              "These grades may be based on a dancer's level of experience or their previous results in feiseanna.",
              "[40] A feis competition is generally judged by between one and three adjudicators, depending on the size of the event and local organisation rules.",
              "Dancers compete in sections of one solo dance at a time, and feiseanna may also include competitions for ceili dances.",
              "An oireachtas (plural oireachtais or oireachtasi) or championship competition is a larger and usually annual Irish dancing competition.",

              "A major contributing factor to the evolution of step dancing in the American South was the in-migration of the Ulster-Scots from Ireland in the late 1700s and early 1800s.",
              "After migrating to North America, the Ulster-Scots became particularly concentrated in the Appalachian foothills.",

              "The dance forms from this part of Ireland most likely bore cultural trademarks from Irish, English, and Scottish traditional dances.",

              "Patrick\u2019s Day dance is one of these traditional dances.",
              "As the footwork of the Ulster-Scots intermingled with the dance styles from the early Native American and African American communities, the technique went through an adaptation process which ultimately led to a blending of stylized percussive footwork, which is exhibited in clogging, and has evolved from casual dancing patterns to sophisticated performance contexts.",
              "A common event where dancing was taught and performed was the ce\u0300ilidh.",

              "The early ce\u0300ilidhs were similar in nature to a \u201choe-down\u201d and revolved around the family, neighbors, and the home.",
              "They were a primary activity that brought the community members together to celebrate their heritage, their culture, and their traditions.",
              "Prior to formal dance classes, children often learned to dance from their parents or their friends.",

              "[6] In 1927, the Gaelic League set up An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha (CLRG, the Irish Dancing Commission), a separate body dedicated to the organisation and standardisation of Irish dance.",
              "CLRG created certifications for dance teachers and began to hold examinations for adjudicators of feisanna.",
              "In the 19th century, the Irish diaspora had spread Irish dance all over the world, especially to North America and Australia.",
              "However, schools and feiseanna were not established until the early 1900s: in America these tended to be created within Irish-American urban communities, notably in Chicago and Massachusetts.",
              "The first classes in stepdancing were held there by the Philadelphia-born John McNamara.",
              "[7] According to the BBC's A Short History of Irish Dance, \"The nature of the Irish dance tradition has changed and adapted over the centuries to accommodate and reflect changing populations and the fusion of new cultures.",
              "The history of Irish dancing is as a result a fascinating one.",
              "The popular Irish dance stage shows of the past ten years have reinvigorated this cultural art, and today Irish dancing is healthy, vibrant, and enjoyed by people across the globe.\"",
              "[8] The first television broadcast of Irish stepdance, on CBS in 1945, contributed to the increased popularity of a stepdance style originating in Ulster.",
              "This style, which incorporated balletic movements and high elevation on the toes, gradually usurped the Munster style with fast, low footwork which had prevailed up to that point.",
              "[9] The success of Riverdance and other dance shows in the late 20th century influenced the choreography and presentation of stepdance in both competitive and public performance environments.",
              "This included the use of simpler costumes and hairstyles for public performance in imitation of the Riverdance styles, and the development of new dance styles, such as hard shoe dances performed to music typically associated with soft shoes.",
              "[10] In competitive dance, movements from flamenco and figure skating began to be incorporated into traditional steps, although such developments were criticised by elements of the competitive dancing community.",
              "[11] The techniques involved in Irish stepdance are essentially similar across each of the individual dance styles.",
              "The basic style of modern step dance used in competitive contexts evolved from the stylistic features of traditional step dance in Munster.",
              "This style is largely performed on the balls of the feet with feet turned outwards.",
              "[12] Competitive dancers are judged on posture, timing, rhythm and execution, which in practice means a rigid torso, rapid and intricate footwork, and legs and feet crossed over each other, with knees close together.",
              "[13] Irish stepdances can be placed into two categories.",
              "Solos, which are danced by a single dancer, and ceilis or teams, which are coordinated with 2 or more dancers.",
              "Reel, slip jig, hornpipe, and jig are all types of Irish stepdances and are also types of Irish traditional music.",
              "These fall into two broad categories based on the shoes worn: 'hard shoe' and 'soft shoe' dances.",
              "Reels, which are in 24 or 44 time, and slip jigs, which are in 98 time and considered to be the lightest and most graceful of the dances, are soft shoe dances.",
              "[14][15] Hornpipes, which can be in 24 or 44 time, are danced in hard shoes.",
              "Three jigs are danced in competition;",
              "the light jig, the single jig, which is also called the Hop jig, and the treble jig, which is also called double jig.",
              "Light and single jigs are in 68 time, and are soft shoes dances, while the treble jig is hard shoe, danced in a slow 68.",
              "The last type of jig is the slip jig, which is danced in 98 time.",
              "There are many dances, which steps vary between schools.",
              "The traditional set dances (danced in hardshoe) like St.",
              "Patrick's Day and the Blackbird, among others, are the only dances that all schools have the same steps.",
              "The actual steps in Irish stepdance are usually unique to each school or dance teacher.",
              "Steps are developed by Irish dance teachers for students of their school.",
              "Each dance is built out of the same basic elements, or steps, but the dance itself is unique, and new dances and movements are being choreographed continuously.",
              "For this reason, videotaping of competitions is forbidden under the rules of An Coimisiun.",
              "Each step is a sequence of foot movements, leg movements and leaps, which lasts for 8 repetitions of 8 bars of music.",
              "It is traditional for each step to be performed first on the right foot and then on the left foot, then transferring to the next step.",
              "This practice leads to a large proportion of dancers exhibiting a preference for their right leg over their left in dance movements.",
              "[16] Hard shoe dancing includes clicking (striking the heels of the shoes against each other), trebles (the toe of the shoe striking the floor), stamps (the entire foot striking the floor), and an increasing number of complicated combinations of taps from the toes and heels.",
              "There are two types of hard shoe dance, the solo dances, which are the hornpipe and treble jig, and the set dances, which are also solo dances, despite having the same name as the social dances.",
              "Traditional set dances use the same choreography regardless of the school whereas contemporary sets are choreographed by the teachers.",
              "The music and steps for each traditional set was set down by past dance masters and passed down under An Coimisiu\u0301n auspices as part of the rich history of stepdancing, hence the \"traditional.\"",
              "There are about 40 sets used in modern stepdance, but the traditional sets performed in most levels of competition are St.",
              "Patrick's Day, the Blackbird, Job of Journeywork, Garden of Daisies, King of the Fairies, and Jockey to the Fair.",
              "The remaining traditional set dances are primarily danced at championship levels.",
              "These tunes vary in tempo to allow for more difficult steps for higher level dancers.",
              "An unusual feature of the set dance tune is that many are \"crooked\", with some of the parts, or sections, of the tunes departing from the common 8 bar formula.",
              "The crooked tune may have a part consisting of 71\u20442 bars, fourteen bars, etc.",
              "For example, the \"St.",
              "Patrick's Day\" traditional set music consists of an eight-bar \"step,\" followed by a fourteen-bar \"set.\"",
              "The group dances are called ce\u0301ili\u0301 dances or, in the less formal but common case, figure dances.",
              "Competitive ce\u0301ili\u0301s are more precise versions of the festive group dances traditionally experienced in social gatherings.",
              "There is a list of 30 ce\u0301ili\u0301 dances that have been standardised and published in An Coimisiun's Ar Rince Ceili (which replaced A\u0301r Rinncidhe Foirne in 2015)[17] as examples of traditional Irish folk dances.",
              "Standardized dances for 4, 6 or 8 dancers are also often found in competition.",
              "Most traditional ce\u0301ili\u0301 dances in competition are significantly shortened in the interests of time.",
              "Many stepdancers never learn the entire dance, as they will never dance the later parts of the dance in competition.",
              "Other ce\u0301ili\u0301 dances are not standardised.",
              "In local competition, figure dances may consist of two or three dancers.",

              "Figure Choreography competitions held at major oireachtasai (championships) involve more than 8 dancers and are a chance for dance schools to show off novel and intricate group choreography.",
              "An Coimisiu\u0301n has also introduced a \"dance drama\" category, which combines physical theatre with Irish dance.",
              "A 200-word story is read and followed by a six-minute dance performance including costumes, mime and facial expression.",
              "[18] Some dance schools recognised by An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha place as much emphasis on ce\u0301ili\u0301 dancing as on solo dancing, meticulously rehearsing the dances as written in the book and striving for perfect interpretation.",
              "In competition, figure dancers are expected to dance their routine in perfect unison, forming seamless yet intricate figures based on their positions relative to each other.",
              "The development of Irish stepdance costumes occurred throughout the 20th century alongside the dance style itself.",
              "Costumes were thus heavily influenced by the rules and competitive structures put in place by An Coimisiu\u0301n and other organisations.",
              "In more recent years, costumes changed dramatically and departed significantly from traditional designs.",
              "[19] Judges at competitions critique the dancers primarily on their performance, but they also take into account presentation.",

              "Costumes can be simple for the beginning female dancer;",
              "they often wear a simple dance skirt and plain blouse or their dancing school's costume.",
              "The certain colours and emblem that are used on the dresses represents the dance school to differentiate it from other dance schools.",
              "These are similar to a solo dress, but are simple with only a few colours, while are still more pounds, depending on the fabric, and may require some getting used to.",
              "School costumes are not decorated with crystals.",
              "At advanced levels where dancers can qualify for Major competitions, solo costumes help each dancer show their sense of style, and enable them to stand out among a crowd.",
              "The dancers can have a new solo costume specially tailored for them with their choice of colours, fabrics, and designs.",
              "Popular designers include Gavin Doherty, Conor O\u2019Sullivan, and Elevation.",
              "Some dancers will even design the costume themselves.",
              "The dancer can also buy second hand from another dancer.",
              "Since the costumes are handmade with pricey materials, unique designs, and are measured to each dancer's body type, the costumes can cost between $1000 and $6,000.",
              "Along with having the handcrafted costumes, championship commission dancers have wigs and crowns.",
              "In commission schools female dancers wear a wig, as wigs are convenient and popular.",
              "Dancers get synthetic ringlet wigs that match their hair color or go with an extremely different shade (a blonde dancer wearing a black wig or vice versa).",

              "The championship competitions are usually danced on stages with a lot of lighting.",
              "To prevent looking washed out, and to enhance their leg muscles, dancers often tan their legs.",
              "A rule was put in place in January 2005 for Under 10 dancers forbidding them to wear fake tan, and in October 2005 it was decided that Under 12 dancers who were in the Beginner and Primary levels would not be allowed to wear fake tan or make up.",
              "The boys used to wear jackets and kilts, but now more commonly perform in black trousers with a colorful vest or jacket and tie and, more frequently, a vest with embroidery and crystals.",
              "The festival style differs, styling more towards a simple unified design, not using much detail or diamonds.",
              "Irish dance festivals (also called \"shows\") have dancers wear their hair either in a wig or down, depending on the age and level of the dancer.",
              "Three types of shoes are worn in competitive step dancing: hard shoes and two kinds of soft shoe.",
              "Hard shoes, also known as the heavy shoes or jig shoes, are leather shoes in the style of an Oxford shoe but with a toe piece similar to the cleat on a tap shoe as well an extended heel, both of which enable the production of rhythmic sounds.",
              "[20] Early 20th century dancers used a variety of shoes, including both those made of cowhide, which minimised sound production, and hobnail boots, which produced loud percussive sounds.",
              "[21] At this time, it was common for women to perform jigs and hornpipes in ordinary lightweight shoes, because their dances did not involve rhythmic percussion, but from the 1930s onward both men and women began to wear heavy leather shoes.",
              "[22] Although in Ireland, hard shoes were used only for heavy jigs and hornpipes, in Australia until the 1950s it was common practice to perform all dances in such heavy shoes.",
              "[23] After An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rince Gaelacha banned the use of metal heel or toe pieces in the 1940s, ordinary shoes were modified with nails, coins or gravel in order to improve the clarity of sound and to emphasise the rhythms of the heavy dances.",
              "[22][24] At this time, it was also common for heel and toe pieces to be improvised with several layers of leather stitched together in a tapered shape.",
              "[25] From the 1980s, toe pieces and heels were developed made from fibreglass or plastics, in response to lighter shoe leather with inferior sound production qualities, and with the aim of minimising damage caused to floors by nails.",
              "The lightweight nature of such materials allowed dancers to achieve more elevation in their steps,[20] and furthermore enabled entirely new movements to be incorporated into dances, such as pointe work in the balletic style on the very tip of the toe piece.",
              "A further innovation, the \"bubble heel\", which added an inwards protrusion to the hollow plastic heel, created a far louder sound when clicking the heels together than was possible in traditional leather-heeled shoes.",
              "[26] An Coimisiu\u0301n later outlawed bubble heels in competition, but plastic heels continued to enable \"click\" movements.",
              "Dancing en pointe was popularised further by the introduction of shoes with modified, more flexible soles.",
              "[26][27] The sound production qualities of shoes were further augmented by the radio microphones built into the toe for shows such as Riverdance.",
              "[28] At the end of the 20th century, a further development occurred in shoe design: the \"flexi\" sole, which removed the rigid \"spine\" from the base of the shoe, in an attempt to enable greater flexibility in the feet.",
              "However, concerns were raised by dance regulators that the lack of support would have an adverse impact on dancers' feet.",
              "[28] , in the shape of a shamrock or other It is common for an intricate but entirely cosmetic buckle to be added to hard shoes for competition.",
              "[29] Commercially available hard shoes are priced at between US$100 and $150.",
              "[30] Until the early 20th century, reels and slip jigs were performed in ordinary walking shoes, as with heavy jigs and hornpipes.",
              "Beginning at the dancing competition of the 1924 Tailteann Games in Dublin, a style of ballet pump held on by a looped piece of elastic was introduced for these dances.",
              "The increased popularity of these shoes over the following decades contributed to a more balletic style in the slip jig which eventually led to this dance being performed exclusively by women.",
              "[31] In the latter half of the 20th century, the pumps changed to a low cut type with crossed laces similar to the Scottish ghillie.",
              "This modern type of shoe, however, differs from the traditional Scottish footwear with a shorter toe box and round laces.",
              "A number of variations on this type are available, including variants with softer leather and split soles.",
              "[29] This change was motivated by a desire to highlight the position of feet to adjudicators, as the usual black colour of the pumps contrasted with the exposed white of the poodle socks.",
              "[31] The flexible nature of these shoes enables rapid and graceful movement as well as elevation in the dancer's performance.",
              "[20] These soft shoes cost around $40 when purchased new.",
              "[30] Until the 1970s, it was common for men to wear the pumps as well, particularly when competing in the slip jig, but at this time, An Coimisiu\u0301n introduced legislation restricting their use to boys under the age of 11.",
              "Consequently, a new style of shoe was adopted for men similar to the contemporary hard shoe, with the toe piece and ankle strap removed but the fibreglass heel retained.",
              "[32] This second type of soft shoe, often known as the \"reel shoe\", is worn exclusively by male dancers, although younger male dancers are occasionally encouraged to begin in jazz shoes which are similar apart from the heel.",
              "[29] From the late 1800s, when the Gaelic League began to organise cultural festivals to promote the cause of Irish nationalism, Irish step dance developed a competitive element.",
              "Throughout the 20th century, structures for competition developed and spread across the world.",
              "Several organisations, many of which at various stages separated from the Gaelic League's An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, independently organise Irish dancing competitions, both in Ireland and elsewhere.",
              "In addition to An Coimisiu\u0301n, Irish step dance is regulated by An Comhdha\u0301il na Mu\u0301inteoiri\u0301 le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, Cumann Rince Na\u0301isiu\u0301nta, the World Irish Dance Association, the Festival Irish Dance Teachers Association, and others.",
              "[33] A number of smaller organisations are described as \"open platform\", meaning that dancers and teachers may affiliate with and compete under other open platform organisations.",
              "Open platform organisations also adhere to broad mission statements rather than strict hierarchy, in an attempt to appeal to dance teachers wishing to remain independent.",
              "[33] An Coimisiu\u0301n and An Comhdha\u0301il are primarily closed to competitors from other organisations, but operate open platform competitions in areas with fewer members.",
              "[34] Irish step dance organisations generally require their teachers and adjudicators to be qualified by the governing body.",
              "Most follow the structure set by An Coimisiu\u0301n, the most important qualifications of which are the TCRG (qualification to teach) and the ADCRG (qualification to adjudicate).",
              "These qualifications are awarded by examinations which test practical and theoretical knowledge of traditional and original steps for both step dance and ceili dancing.",

              "[38] A feis (/\u02c8f\u025b\u0283/, plural feiseanna) is a competitive step dance event.",
              "The word \"feis\" means \"festival\" in Irish, and traditionally consists of dancing competitions as well as competition in music and traditional crafts.",
              "Many modern feiseanna, however, are solely Irish dancing events.",
              "[39] At a feis, several grades of competition are typically offered, in accordance with regional practice and the rules of the governing organisation.",
              "These grades may be based on a dancer's level of experience or their previous results in feiseanna.",

              "Published online by Cambridge University Press: 27 July 2015 Catherine Foley's book is the first systematic, ethnohistorical study of step dance in Ireland, and is a timely and welcome addition to critical dance scholarship.",
              "Coming from an ethnochoreological perspectice that engages with the dialectical relationship between movement systems and the historical and cultural conditions in which they are practiced, Foley takes us on a journey with Irish step dance from its roots in rural Ireland of the eighteenth century through to its present day theatrical and competitive practice.",
              "Within this trajectory, she identifies three main stylistic forms of step dance associated with the distinctive performance contexts of the local, national, and global.",
              "In the local context, she outlines the pivotal role of itinerant dance masters in rural North Kerry throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries;",
              "the role of the Gaelic League in creating a national dance canon in the early twentieth century;",
              "and, in the contemporary context, the role of commercial imperatives in theatrical and competitive dance within a global cultural economy.",
              "Utilizing a combination of ethnographic observation, oral history interviews, and documentary sources, Foley demonstrates how the changing skills, aesthetics, and symbolism of step dance reflect a changing society and value systems in each of these performance contexts.",
              "Research on the history of dancing as a leisure activity in rural Ireland in the nineteenth century is not new.",
              "It has been well served in the work of Breathnach (Reference Breathnach1983), Brennan (Reference Brennan1999), and Friel (Reference Friel2004) with reference to the southeast of Ireland.",
              "Both Breathnach and Brennan use data collected by the Irish Folklore Comission, and Brennan's book also contains valuable ethnographic interview material from various parts of the country.",
              "However, Foley's unique contribution to the history and culture of step dancing is her sustained and meticulously conducted ethnographic research in the North Kerry area between 1983 and 1986, and again in 2001.",
              "The author, herself a step dancer and ethnochoreologist, clearly establishes her role in the ethnographic process in Chapter 1.",
              "Her own experience as a dancer and her prolonged immersion in step dance culture enables her to bring an embodied knowledge and insider view to the project, while her training in Labanotation assists her in providing a precise and detailed description and comparative analysis of the dance styles under review.",
              "The book's discussion, laid out in eight chapters, moves chronologically from the nineteeth century to the twenty-first century.",
              "Chapter 2 addresses the influence of the continental European dance aesthetic on the local context and particularly the role of dance in the \u201ccivilizing process\u201d (23) and in keeping with an individual's status in a hierarchical society.",
              "Though interesting and informative, this chapter could have been substantially edited without damaging its contextualising function.",
              "Chapters 3 and 4 are devoted to an account of the emergence of itinerant dancing masters and of their integral role in rural society within the context of colonialism.",
              "Foley's ethnographic interviews, especially those with dancers who had learned under the instruction of Jeremiah Molyneaux, the last surviving itinerant dance master in the North Kerry, comprise the cornerstone of this work.",
              "Based on information about individual dancing masters, including their backgrounds and personal histories, as well as their teaching schedules, practices, and payment systems, she builds a clear profile of their role in the transmission of dance to the local peasantry.",
              "Given the reliance on documentary evidence in historical dance research and the \u201crelative dearth of information on the practices and experiences of dancers\u201d (O'Connor Reference O'Connor2013, 153).",
              "Foley's recording of a dance tradition on the verge of disappearing from living memory adds considerably to our knowledge of step-dance practice in the nineteenth century.",
              "The embodied knowledge and the cultural meanings of step dance for the Molyneaux dancers are the subjects of Chapter 4.",
              "This knowledge, some of which was acquired through formal training and some informally from local culture, included posture and steps, movement and performance style, knowledge of appropriate ritual occasions, and venues for performing.",
              "Dancers also knew the history of step dance and dancing masters in their area, what made a good dancer, who \u201cowned\u201d steps, and where and from whom they learned steps.",
              "In each of these ways, dancers embodied and expressed their embeddedness in their own place.",
              "\u201cDancing and talking about dancing contributed to their feeling of being alive and being alive to their local environment, culture and history\u201d (105).",
              "Of particular interest in Foley's analysis is the interlinking of the close-to-the-floor, earthy dance style, with a grounded connection to the land, and the creation of community through dance.",
              "The inclusion of more quotes from the Molyneaux dancers themselves about the cultural meanings they constructed around their dance practice would, in my view, have strengthened the emic dimension and enhanced the \u201cthick description\u201d (Geertz Reference Geertz1973, 7)of the narrative in this chapter.",
              "Chapter 5 engages with the transmission of nationalist cultural values through step dance performance in a changing Ireland at the close of the nineteenth century.",
              "Here Foley outlines the central role of the Gaelic League in inventing \u201cIrish\u201d dance by shaping both competitive (feiseanna) and social (ce\u0301ili\u0301) dancing in line with a nationalist agenda, as well as the hegemonic role of Coimisiu\u0301n le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha (The Irish Dancing Commission) in maintaining a rigid control over dance practice from the 1930s.",
              "Following rural to urban migration, step dance transmisson shifted, too, with younger age groups attending classes, a transition from male to female teachers, and an increased discipline in instruction.",
              "By and large local dance traditions gave way to a national standard characterized by inter alia, a uniform and more elevated dance style, more intricate stepping, and traveling movement.",
              "Though general critical commentary on the \u201cnational\u201d era in step dance is by now familiar (see Breathnach Reference Breathnach1983;",
              "Brennan Reference Brennan1999;",
              "Cullinane Reference Cullinane1998, Reference Cullinane2003;",
              "Hall, Reference Hall2008), the detail in this chapter of dance practice, training, and transmission is well- grounded historically and theoretically, and provides a suitable context for discussion of the national system in the local context of North Kerry in Chapter 6.",
              "The chapter also raises interesting questions about changing cultural identities, particularly those of social class and gender during this period.",
              "For example, the process whereby dance, a mark of masculinity in rural Ireland, shifted to being \u201cperceived by many urban men to be unmanly\u201d (150) invites further inquiry.",
              "Foley discusses the performance of Irishness through step dance in a contemporary context in Chapters 6 and 7.",
              "The issues of modernity, globalization, and commercialization have been most frequently addressed with reference to spectacular global theatrical productions such as Riverdance and Lord of the Dance, so it is insightful to learn how these are negotiated in the \u201cglocal\u201d (Robertson Reference Robertson, Feathersone, Lash and Robertson1995) contexts discussed by Foley.",
              "In Chapter 6, she investigates the changing nature of contemporary step dance performance in the local dance school, Rinceoiri\u0301 na Ri\u0301ochta, as well as observing the World Championships of Irish dance in Killarney in the context of a competition culture.",
              "Chapter 7 is devoted to the work of Siamsa Ti\u0301re, the Irish National Folk Theatre founded in 1974.",
              "She traces its origin, and organizational and artistic strategies, and outlines the challenges of constructing and performing an Irishness that will appeal to a predominantly tourist audience, while at the same time maintaining an artistic and cultural integrity.",
              "The perennial question about any ethnographic endeavor is the extent to which the chosen field site is representative of the whole.",
              "And since the title of Foley's book, Step Dancing in Ireland, has a national reference point, it merits comparison with other historical or ethnographic work.",
              "Brennan, for instance, suggests that dancing in Connemara and some of the Ulster counties was for the most part learned informally either in the family or community setting (Brennan Reference Brennan1999, 59).",
              "Would it be reasonable to assume that dancing masters were fewer or absent from the poorer parts of the country?",
              "And if this were the case, did it have implications for dance styles and functions in these parts?",
              "Comparitive analysis would also uncover similarities as well as differences.",
              "The values of selflessness and cooperation, for example, associated with \u201cthe Gaelic idea\u201d (156) of the nationalist era have also been identified as a feature of the revival of folk dance in England around the same time (Snape Reference Snape2009).",
              "While acknowledging the importance of estblishing the general theoretical framework early on, I do struggle somewhat with the placing of definitions of key themes and concepts in Chapter 1.",
              "My preference would have been to interweave concepts with the ethnographic narrative as it unfolded in the subsequent chapters.",
              "This could have avoided some repetition and improved the flow of discussion in the early part of the book.",
              "The inclusion of photographs adds to its visual appeal, particularly those older and rarer images of the dancing masters Neidin Batt Walsh and his wife from 1875, and of Jeremiah Molyneaux, c.",
              "1938.",
              "Foley's publication, integrating as it does a prodigious amount of primary research with a considered and theoretically grounded analysis, makes a significant contribution to the growing multiperspectival body of critical work on dance in Ireland.",
              "It is essential reading for scholars of dance, history, and Irish culture, and will also appeal to a general audience interested in any of these areas.",

              "In many cases, costumes are sold at high prices and can even be custom made.",
              "Each costume is different, with varying colors and patterns, designed to attract the judge's eye in competitions and the audience's eye in performance.",
              "General appearance beside the costume is also equally important.",
              "Female dancers would typically curl their hair before each competition or wear curled wigs, while male dancers would neatly style their hair to a shape to their liking.",
              "Poodle Socks are worn by female dancers while males wear plain black socks.",
              "Poodle socks are white socks that stretch to typically 1-4 inches above the ankle, depending on the dancers preference.",
              "They also have distinctive ribbing, and can be embroidered with gems. Riverdance, an Irish step-dancing performance in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest that later became a hugely successful theatrical production, greatly contributed to its popularity.",
              "Once Riverdance became a large production, it changed the way that Irish dance was performed and viewed.",
              "Now that entrepreneurs could capitalize on Irish culture, they were able to tweak it to the audience's liking.",
              "This meant adding a theatrical flair to the performance, including arm movements (as opposed to the previously rigid top half that dancers maintained) as well as sexualizing the dance and the costumes.",
              "To many, this was a betrayal of tradition, but to some, it was a way of expanding Irish culture and became widely accepted.",
              "Following after Riverdance was Lord of the Dance and many other theatrical productions based on Irish stepdance.",

              "The dances for soft shoe and hard shoe are different and go by different names.",
              "Different music with varying beats are played based on the dance, though each soft and hard shoe dances all share basic moves and rhythms. The dancing traditions of Ireland are likely to have grown in tandem with Irish traditional music.",
              "Its first roots may have been in Pre-Christian Ireland, but Irish dance was also partially influenced by dance forms on the Continent, especially the quadrille dances.",
              "Some of the earliest recorded references to Irish dance are to the Rinnce Fada or \"long dance\", towards the end of the 17th century, which was performed largely on social occasions.",
              "[1] Traveling dancing masters taught all over Ireland beginning around the 1750s and continuing as late as the early 1900s.",
              "[2] By the late 19th century, at least three related styles of step dance had developed in Ireland.",
              "The style practised in Munster saw dancers on the balls of their feet, using intricate percussive techniques to create complex rhythm.",
              "On the other hand, a tradition developed in Ulster saw dancers instead using their heel to create a persistent drumming effect, and primarily performing in pairs.",
              "The Connemara style, later described as sean-no\u0301s dance, combined heel and ball movements with the swaying of the torso and vigorous movement of the arms.[3] The foundation of the Gaelic League in 1893, an Irish nationalist body formed with the purpose of preserving traditional Irish language and culture, radically altered the cultural status of step dance.",
              "Frank Hall has described this as the moment in which \"step-Dancing in Ireland became 'Irish dancing'\", and as therefore the most significant single event in the development of the dance form.",
              "[4] Although informal competitions had long been held between towns and students of different dance masters, the first organised feis was held in 1897 by the League.",
              "[5] The League began to codify and promote the form of step dance which was practiced in southern areas.",
              "[2] This codification, practised from the early 1920s, greatly narrowed the range of traditional Irish dances acceptable in popular culture.",
              "[6] In 1927, the Gaelic League set up An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha (CLRG, the Irish Dancing Commission), a separate body dedicated to the organisation and standardisation of Irish dance.",
              "CLRG created certifications for dance teachers and began to hold examinations for adjudicators of feisanna.",
              "In the 19th century, the Irish diaspora had spread Irish dance all over the world, especially to North America and Australia.",
              "However, schools and feiseanna were not established until the early 1900s: in America these tended to be created within Irish-American urban communities, notably in Chicago and Massachusetts.",

              "[8] The first television broadcast of Irish stepdance, on CBS in 1945, contributed to the increased popularity of a stepdance style originating in Ulster.",
              "This style, which incorporated balletic movements and high elevation on the toes, gradually usurped the Munster style with fast, low footwork which had prevailed up to that point.",
              "[9] The success of Riverdance and other dance shows in the late 20th century influenced the choreography and presentation of stepdance in both competitive and public performance environments.",
              "This included the use of simpler costumes and hairstyles for public performance in imitation of the Riverdance styles, and the development of new dance styles, such as hard shoe dances performed to music typically associated with soft shoes.",
              "[10] In competitive dance, movements from flamenco and figure skating began to be incorporated into traditional steps, although such developments were criticised by elements of the competitive dancing community.",
              "[11] The techniques involved in Irish stepdance are essentially similar across each of the individual dance styles.",
              "The basic style of modern step dance used in competitive contexts evolved from the stylistic features of traditional step dance in Munster.",
              "This style is largely performed on the balls of the feet with feet turned outwards.",
              "[12] Competitive dancers are judged on posture, timing, rhythm and execution, which in practice means a rigid torso, rapid and intricate footwork, and legs and feet crossed over each other, with knees close together.",
              "[13] Irish stepdances can be placed into two categories.",
              "Solos, which are danced by a single dancer, and ceilis or teams, which are coordinated with 2 or more dancers.",
              "Reel, slip jig, hornpipe, and jig are all types of Irish stepdances and are also types of Irish traditional music.",

              "Light and single jigs are in 68 time, and are soft shoes dances, while the treble jig is hard shoe, danced in a slow 68.",

              "Each dance is built out of the same basic elements, or steps, but the dance itself is unique, and new dances and movements are being choreographed continuously.",
              "For this reason, videotaping of competitions is forbidden under the rules of An Coimisiun.",
              "Each step is a sequence of foot movements, leg movements and leaps, which lasts for 8 repetitions of 8 bars of music.",
              "It is traditional for each step to be performed first on the right foot and then on the left foot, then transferring to the next step.",
              "This practice leads to a large proportion of dancers exhibiting a preference for their right leg over their left in dance movements.",
              "[16] Hard shoe dancing includes clicking (striking the heels of the shoes against each other), trebles (the toe of the shoe striking the floor), stamps (the entire foot striking the floor), and an increasing number of complicated combinations of taps from the toes and heels.",
              "There are two types of hard shoe dance, the solo dances, which are the hornpipe and treble jig, and the set dances, which are also solo dances, despite having the same name as the social dances.",
              "Traditional set dances use the same choreography regardless of the school whereas contemporary sets are choreographed by the teachers.",

              "Three types of shoes are worn in competitive step dancing: hard shoes and two kinds of soft shoe.",
              "Hard shoes, also known as the heavy shoes or jig shoes, are leather shoes in the style of an Oxford shoe but with a toe piece similar to the cleat on a tap shoe as well an extended heel, both of which enable the production of rhythmic sounds.",
              "[20] Early 20th century dancers used a variety of shoes, including both those made of cowhide, which minimised sound production, and hobnail boots, which produced loud percussive sounds.",
              "[21] At this time, it was common for women to perform jigs and hornpipes in ordinary lightweight shoes, because their dances did not involve rhythmic percussion, but from the 1930s onward both men and women began to wear heavy leather shoes.",
              "[22] Although in Ireland, hard shoes were used only for heavy jigs and hornpipes, in Australia until the 1950s it was common practice to perform all dances in such heavy shoes.",
              "[23] After An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rince Gaelacha banned the use of metal heel or toe pieces in the 1940s, ordinary shoes were modified with nails, coins or gravel in order to improve the clarity of sound and to emphasise the rhythms of the heavy dances.",
              "[22][24] At this time, it was also common for heel and toe pieces to be improvised with several layers of leather stitched together in a tapered shape.",
              "[25] From the 1980s, toe pieces and heels were developed made from fibreglass or plastics, in response to lighter shoe leather with inferior sound production qualities, and with the aim of minimising damage caused to floors by nails.",
              "The lightweight nature of such materials allowed dancers to achieve more elevation in their steps,[20] and furthermore enabled entirely new movements to be incorporated into dances, such as pointe work in the balletic style on the very tip of the toe piece.",
              "A further innovation, the \"bubble heel\", which added an inwards protrusion to the hollow plastic heel, created a far louder sound when clicking the heels together than was possible in traditional leather-heeled shoes.",
              "[26] An Coimisiu\u0301n later outlawed bubble heels in competition, but plastic heels continued to enable \"click\" movements.",
              "Dancing en pointe was popularised further by the introduction of shoes with modified, more flexible soles.",
              "[26][27] The sound production qualities of shoes were further augmented by the radio microphones built into the toe for shows such as Riverdance.",
              "[28] At the end of the 20th century, a further development occurred in shoe design: the \"flexi\" sole, which removed the rigid \"spine\" from the base of the shoe, in an attempt to enable greater flexibility in the feet.",
              "However, concerns were raised by dance regulators that the lack of support would have an adverse impact on dancers' feet.",
              "[28] , in the shape of a shamrock or other It is common for an intricate but entirely cosmetic buckle to be added to hard shoes for competition.",
              "[29] Commercially available hard shoes are priced at between US$100 and $150.",
              "[30] Until the early 20th century, reels and slip jigs were performed in ordinary walking shoes, as with heavy jigs and hornpipes.",
              "Beginning at the dancing competition of the 1924 Tailteann Games in Dublin, a style of ballet pump held on by a looped piece of elastic was introduced for these dances.",
              "The increased popularity of these shoes over the following decades contributed to a more balletic style in the slip jig which eventually led to this dance being performed exclusively by women.",
              "[31] In the latter half of the 20th century, the pumps changed to a low cut type with crossed laces similar to the Scottish ghillie.",
              "This modern type of shoe, however, differs from the traditional Scottish footwear with a shorter toe box and round laces.",
              "A number of variations on this type are available, including variants with softer leather and split soles.",
              "[29] This change was motivated by a desire to highlight the position of feet to adjudicators, as the usual black colour of the pumps contrasted with the exposed white of the poodle socks.",
              "[31] The flexible nature of these shoes enables rapid and graceful movement as well as elevation in the dancer's performance.",
              "[20] These soft shoes cost around $40 when purchased new.",
              "[30] Until the 1970s, it was common for men to wear the pumps as well, particularly when competing in the slip jig, but at this time, An Coimisiu\u0301n introduced legislation restricting their use to boys under the age of 11.",
              "Consequently, a new style of shoe was adopted for men similar to the contemporary hard shoe, with the toe piece and ankle strap removed but the fibreglass heel retained.",
              "[32] This second type of soft shoe, often known as the \"reel shoe\", is worn exclusively by male dancers, although younger male dancers are occasionally encouraged to begin in jazz shoes which are similar apart from the heel.",
              "[29] From the late 1800s, when the Gaelic League began to organise cultural festivals to promote the cause of Irish nationalism, Irish step dance developed a competitive element.",
              "Throughout the 20th century, structures for competition developed and spread across the world.",
              "Several organisations, many of which at various stages separated from the Gaelic League's An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, independently organise Irish dancing competitions, both in Ireland and elsewhere.",
              "In addition to An Coimisiu\u0301n, Irish step dance is regulated by An Comhdha\u0301il na Mu\u0301inteoiri\u0301 le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, Cumann Rince Na\u0301isiu\u0301nta, the World Irish Dance Association, the Festival Irish Dance Teachers Association, and others.",
              "[33] A number of smaller organisations are described as \"open platform\", meaning that dancers and teachers may affiliate with and compete under other open platform organisations.",
              "Open platform organisations also adhere to broad mission statements rather than strict hierarchy, in an attempt to appeal to dance teachers wishing to remain independent.",
              "[33] An Coimisiu\u0301n and An Comhdha\u0301il are primarily closed to competitors from other organisations, but operate open platform competitions in areas with fewer members.",
              "[34] Irish step dance organisations generally require their teachers and adjudicators to be qualified by the governing body.",
              "Most follow the structure set by An Coimisiu\u0301n, the most important qualifications of which are the TCRG (qualification to teach) and the ADCRG (qualification to adjudicate).",
              "These qualifications are awarded by examinations which test practical and theoretical knowledge of traditional and original steps for both step dance and ceili dancing.",
              "[35][36] An Comhdha\u0301il and some other organisations recognise the qualifications awarded by An Coimisiu\u0301n,[37] but An Coimisiu\u0301n only recognises teachers and adjudicators qualified under their own examinations.",
              "[38] A feis (/\u02c8f\u025b\u0283/, plural feiseanna) is a competitive step dance event.",
              "The word \"feis\" means \"festival\" in Irish, and traditionally consists of dancing competitions as well as competition in music and traditional crafts.",
              "Many modern feiseanna, however, are solely Irish dancing events.",
              "[39] At a feis, several grades of competition are typically offered, in accordance with regional practice and the rules of the governing organisation.",
              "These grades may be based on a dancer's level of experience or their previous results in feiseanna.",
              "[40] A feis competition is generally judged by between one and three adjudicators, depending on the size of the event and local organisation rules.",
              "Dancers compete in sections of one solo dance at a time, and feiseanna may also include competitions for ceili dances.",
              "An oireachtas (plural oireachtais or oireachtasi) or championship competition is a larger and usually annual Irish dancing competition.",
              "The first oireachtas, established by the Gaelic League, was inspired by the Welsh eisteddfod and was conceived as an Irish national festival.",
              "[41] An oireachtas is often the highest-level competition for a region or country, such as Oireachtas Rince Na hEirann (The All-Ireland Championships) or the North American Irish Dancing Championships.",
              "Oireachtais operate at only one level of competition and are judged by multiple adjudicators.",
              "In An Coimisiu\u0301n oireachtais, dancers perform three dances in consecutive rounds and are placed according to their cumulative scores.",
              "Like feiseanna, oireachtais may include competitions for ceili dances.",
              "[42] Many of the larger organisations operate an annual World Championships for their organisation's dancers.",
              "[33] The largest and oldest of these is An Coimisiu\u0301n's Oireachtas Rince Na Cruinne, which was established in 1970, and involves up to 3000 competing dancers who have qualified at regional and national oireachtais.",
              "[42] At the 1897 general meeting of the Gaelic League, displays of dancing were observed to be more popular than the speeches and debates.",
              "The public performance of step dance, therefore, evolved with the organisation of social dances as a means for the Gaelic League to ensure both ongoing popularity and financial stability for its revolutionary activities.",
              "[43] Riverdance was the interval act in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest, held in Dublin, which contributed to the popularity of Irish stepdance, and is still considered a significant watershed in Irish culture.",
              "[44] Its roots are in a three-part suite of baroque-influenced traditional music called \"Timedance\", composed and recorded for the 1981 contest, which was also hosted in Dublin.",
              "This first performance featured American-born Irish dancing champions Jean Butler and Michael Flatley, the RTE\u0301 Concert Orchestra and the Celtic choral group Anu\u0301na with a score written by Bill Whelan.",

              "This style, which incorporated balletic movements and high elevation on the toes, gradually usurped the Munster style with fast, low footwork which had prevailed up to that point.",
              "[9] The success of Riverdance and other dance shows in the late 20th century influenced the choreography and presentation of stepdance in both competitive and public performance environments.",
              "This included the use of simpler costumes and hairstyles for public performance in imitation of the Riverdance styles, and the development of new dance styles, such as hard shoe dances performed to music typically associated with soft shoes.",
              "[10] In competitive dance, movements from flamenco and figure skating began to be incorporated into traditional steps, although such developments were criticised by elements of the competitive dancing community.",
              "[11] The techniques involved in Irish stepdance are essentially similar across each of the individual dance styles.",
              "The basic style of modern step dance used in competitive contexts evolved from the stylistic features of traditional step dance in Munster.",
              "This style is largely performed on the balls of the feet with feet turned outwards.",
              "[12] Competitive dancers are judged on posture, timing, rhythm and execution, which in practice means a rigid torso, rapid and intricate footwork, and legs and feet crossed over each other, with knees close together.",
              "[13] Irish stepdances can be placed into two categories.",
              "Solos, which are danced by a single dancer, and ceilis or teams, which are coordinated with 2 or more dancers.",
              "Reel, slip jig, hornpipe, and jig are all types of Irish stepdances and are also types of Irish traditional music.",
              "These fall into two broad categories based on the shoes worn: 'hard shoe' and 'soft shoe' dances.",
              "Reels, which are in 24 or 44 time, and slip jigs, which are in 98 time and considered to be the lightest and most graceful of the dances, are soft shoe dances.",

              "For this reason, videotaping of competitions is forbidden under the rules of An Coimisiun.",
              "Each step is a sequence of foot movements, leg movements and leaps, which lasts for 8 repetitions of 8 bars of music.",
              "It is traditional for each step to be performed first on the right foot and then on the left foot, then transferring to the next step.",
              "This practice leads to a large proportion of dancers exhibiting a preference for their right leg over their left in dance movements.",
              "[16] Hard shoe dancing includes clicking (striking the heels of the shoes against each other), trebles (the toe of the shoe striking the floor), stamps (the entire foot striking the floor), and an increasing number of complicated combinations of taps from the toes and heels.",
              "There are two types of hard shoe dance, the solo dances, which are the hornpipe and treble jig, and the set dances, which are also solo dances, despite having the same name as the social dances.",

              "A 200-word story is read and followed by a six-minute dance performance including costumes, mime and facial expression.",
              "[18] Some dance schools recognised by An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha place as much emphasis on ce\u0301ili\u0301 dancing as on solo dancing, meticulously rehearsing the dances as written in the book and striving for perfect interpretation.",
              "In competition, figure dancers are expected to dance their routine in perfect unison, forming seamless yet intricate figures based on their positions relative to each other.",
              "The development of Irish stepdance costumes occurred throughout the 20th century alongside the dance style itself.",
              "Costumes were thus heavily influenced by the rules and competitive structures put in place by An Coimisiu\u0301n and other organisations.",

              "These are similar to a solo dress, but are simple with only a few colours, while are still more pounds, depending on the fabric, and may require some getting used to.",
              "School costumes are not decorated with crystals.",
              "At advanced levels where dancers can qualify for Major competitions, solo costumes help each dancer show their sense of style, and enable them to stand out among a crowd.",

              "The dancer can also buy second hand from another dancer.",

              "Irish dance festivals (also called \"shows\") have dancers wear their hair either in a wig or down, depending on the age and level of the dancer.",
              "Three types of shoes are worn in competitive step dancing: hard shoes and two kinds of soft shoe.",
              "Hard shoes, also known as the heavy shoes or jig shoes, are leather shoes in the style of an Oxford shoe but with a toe piece similar to the cleat on a tap shoe as well an extended heel, both of which enable the production of rhythmic sounds.",
              "[20] Early 20th century dancers used a variety of shoes, including both those made of cowhide, which minimised sound production, and hobnail boots, which produced loud percussive sounds.",
              "[21] At this time, it was common for women to perform jigs and hornpipes in ordinary lightweight shoes, because their dances did not involve rhythmic percussion, but from the 1930s onward both men and women began to wear heavy leather shoes.",
              "[22] Although in Ireland, hard shoes were used only for heavy jigs and hornpipes, in Australia until the 1950s it was common practice to perform all dances in such heavy shoes.",
              "[23] After An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rince Gaelacha banned the use of metal heel or toe pieces in the 1940s, ordinary shoes were modified with nails, coins or gravel in order to improve the clarity of sound and to emphasise the rhythms of the heavy dances.",
              "[22][24] At this time, it was also common for heel and toe pieces to be improvised with several layers of leather stitched together in a tapered shape.",
              "[25] From the 1980s, toe pieces and heels were developed made from fibreglass or plastics, in response to lighter shoe leather with inferior sound production qualities, and with the aim of minimising damage caused to floors by nails.",
              "The lightweight nature of such materials allowed dancers to achieve more elevation in their steps,[20] and furthermore enabled entirely new movements to be incorporated into dances, such as pointe work in the balletic style on the very tip of the toe piece.",
              "A further innovation, the \"bubble heel\", which added an inwards protrusion to the hollow plastic heel, created a far louder sound when clicking the heels together than was possible in traditional leather-heeled shoes.",
              "[26] An Coimisiu\u0301n later outlawed bubble heels in competition, but plastic heels continued to enable \"click\" movements.",
              "Dancing en pointe was popularised further by the introduction of shoes with modified, more flexible soles.",
              "[26][27] The sound production qualities of shoes were further augmented by the radio microphones built into the toe for shows such as Riverdance.",
              "[28] At the end of the 20th century, a further development occurred in shoe design: the \"flexi\" sole, which removed the rigid \"spine\" from the base of the shoe, in an attempt to enable greater flexibility in the feet.",
              "However, concerns were raised by dance regulators that the lack of support would have an adverse impact on dancers' feet.",
              "[28] , in the shape of a shamrock or other It is common for an intricate but entirely cosmetic buckle to be added to hard shoes for competition.",
              "[29] Commercially available hard shoes are priced at between US$100 and $150.",
              "[30] Until the early 20th century, reels and slip jigs were performed in ordinary walking shoes, as with heavy jigs and hornpipes.",
              "Beginning at the dancing competition of the 1924 Tailteann Games in Dublin, a style of ballet pump held on by a looped piece of elastic was introduced for these dances.",
              "The increased popularity of these shoes over the following decades contributed to a more balletic style in the slip jig which eventually led to this dance being performed exclusively by women.",
              "[31] In the latter half of the 20th century, the pumps changed to a low cut type with crossed laces similar to the Scottish ghillie.",
              "This modern type of shoe, however, differs from the traditional Scottish footwear with a shorter toe box and round laces.",
              "A number of variations on this type are available, including variants with softer leather and split soles.",
              "[29] This change was motivated by a desire to highlight the position of feet to adjudicators, as the usual black colour of the pumps contrasted with the exposed white of the poodle socks.",
              "[31] The flexible nature of these shoes enables rapid and graceful movement as well as elevation in the dancer's performance.",
              "[20] These soft shoes cost around $40 when purchased new.",
              "[30] Until the 1970s, it was common for men to wear the pumps as well, particularly when competing in the slip jig, but at this time, An Coimisiu\u0301n introduced legislation restricting their use to boys under the age of 11.",
              "Consequently, a new style of shoe was adopted for men similar to the contemporary hard shoe, with the toe piece and ankle strap removed but the fibreglass heel retained.",
              "[32] This second type of soft shoe, often known as the \"reel shoe\", is worn exclusively by male dancers, although younger male dancers are occasionally encouraged to begin in jazz shoes which are similar apart from the heel.",
              "[29] From the late 1800s, when the Gaelic League began to organise cultural festivals to promote the cause of Irish nationalism, Irish step dance developed a competitive element.",
              "Throughout the 20th century, structures for competition developed and spread across the world.",
              "Several organisations, many of which at various stages separated from the Gaelic League's An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, independently organise Irish dancing competitions, both in Ireland and elsewhere.",
              "In addition to An Coimisiu\u0301n, Irish step dance is regulated by An Comhdha\u0301il na Mu\u0301inteoiri\u0301 le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, Cumann Rince Na\u0301isiu\u0301nta, the World Irish Dance Association, the Festival Irish Dance Teachers Association, and others.",
              "[33] A number of smaller organisations are described as \"open platform\", meaning that dancers and teachers may affiliate with and compete under other open platform organisations.",
              "Open platform organisations also adhere to broad mission statements rather than strict hierarchy, in an attempt to appeal to dance teachers wishing to remain independent.",
              "[33] An Coimisiu\u0301n and An Comhdha\u0301il are primarily closed to competitors from other organisations, but operate open platform competitions in areas with fewer members.",
              "[34] Irish step dance organisations generally require their teachers and adjudicators to be qualified by the governing body.",
              "Most follow the structure set by An Coimisiu\u0301n, the most important qualifications of which are the TCRG (qualification to teach) and the ADCRG (qualification to adjudicate).",
              "These qualifications are awarded by examinations which test practical and theoretical knowledge of traditional and original steps for both step dance and ceili dancing.",
              "[35][36] An Comhdha\u0301il and some other organisations recognise the qualifications awarded by An Coimisiu\u0301n,[37] but An Coimisiu\u0301n only recognises teachers and adjudicators qualified under their own examinations.",
              "[38] A feis (/\u02c8f\u025b\u0283/, plural feiseanna) is a competitive step dance event.",
              "The word \"feis\" means \"festival\" in Irish, and traditionally consists of dancing competitions as well as competition in music and traditional crafts.",
              "Many modern feiseanna, however, are solely Irish dancing events.",
              "[39] At a feis, several grades of competition are typically offered, in accordance with regional practice and the rules of the governing organisation.",
              "These grades may be based on a dancer's level of experience or their previous results in feiseanna.",
              "[40] A feis competition is generally judged by between one and three adjudicators, depending on the size of the event and local organisation rules.",
              "Dancers compete in sections of one solo dance at a time, and feiseanna may also include competitions for ceili dances.",
              "An oireachtas (plural oireachtais or oireachtasi) or championship competition is a larger and usually annual Irish dancing competition.",
              "The first oireachtas, established by the Gaelic League, was inspired by the Welsh eisteddfod and was conceived as an Irish national festival.",
              "[41] An oireachtas is often the highest-level competition for a region or country, such as Oireachtas Rince Na hEirann (The All-Ireland Championships) or the North American Irish Dancing Championships.",
              "Oireachtais operate at only one level of competition and are judged by multiple adjudicators.",
              "In An Coimisiu\u0301n oireachtais, dancers perform three dances in consecutive rounds and are placed according to their cumulative scores.",
              "Like feiseanna, oireachtais may include competitions for ceili dances.",
              "[42] Many of the larger organisations operate an annual World Championships for their organisation's dancers.",
              "[33] The largest and oldest of these is An Coimisiu\u0301n's Oireachtas Rince Na Cruinne, which was established in 1970, and involves up to 3000 competing dancers who have qualified at regional and national oireachtais.",
              "[42] At the 1897 general meeting of the Gaelic League, displays of dancing were observed to be more popular than the speeches and debates.",
              "The public performance of step dance, therefore, evolved with the organisation of social dances as a means for the Gaelic League to ensure both ongoing popularity and financial stability for its revolutionary activities.",
              "[43] Riverdance was the interval act in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest, held in Dublin, which contributed to the popularity of Irish stepdance, and is still considered a significant watershed in Irish culture.",
              "[44] Its roots are in a three-part suite of baroque-influenced traditional music called \"Timedance\", composed and recorded for the 1981 contest, which was also hosted in Dublin.",
              "This first performance featured American-born Irish dancing champions Jean Butler and Michael Flatley, the RTE\u0301 Concert Orchestra and the Celtic choral group Anu\u0301na with a score written by Bill Whelan.",
              "Riverdance's success includes an eight-week sell out season at Radio City Music Hall, New York, with the sales of merchandise resulting in Radio City Music Hall merchandise sale's record smashed during the first performance, sell-out tours at King's Hall, Belfast, Northern Ireland, and The Green Glens Arena, Millstreet, County Cork, Ireland, plus a huge three and a half-month return to The Apollo in Hammersmith with advance ticket sales of over \u00a35,000,000.",
              "After Flatley left Riverdance, he created other Irish dance shows including Lord of the Dance, Celtic Tiger Live and Feet of Flames, the last-named being an expansion of Lord of the Dance.",
              "A 2007 RTE\u0301 reality television program, Celebrity Jigs 'n' Reels, combined traditional stepdance with modern music and choreography in a competitive format which paired celebrities with professional dancers.",
              "Competitors were judged by well-known stepdancers including Jean Butler and Colin Dunne.",
              "[45] The 2011 Sue Bourne documentary film Jig followed eight dancers as they prepared for An Coimisiu\u0301n's 2010 World Championships in Glasgow.",
              "[46] On its release, the film was praised for attention to technical aspects of stepdance, but criticised for failing to explain the historical and socio-political context of the event.",

              "[50] The series was noted for its focus on the extreme elements of the modern Irish stepdance world, and the increasing financial pressures on competitors.",
              "[51] Reviewers also noted that Jigs and Wigs presented a stepdance world increasingly divorced from perceived Celtic traditions.",

              "Irish set dancing, sometimes called \"Irish sets\", is a popular form of folk dancing in Ireland danced to Irish tunes in groups of eight or four dancers.",
              "It is also sometime named set dance, but this name refers more often to a kind of dance in Irish stepdance.",
              "Set dancing is based on quadrilles, which were court dances.",
              "These were transformed by the Irish into a unique folk dance of the Irish rural communities.",
              "When the Gaelic League was formed in 1897, it sought to discourage set dancing, because it was perceived as being of foreign origins, and consequently at odds with the League's nationalist agenda.",
              "In its place, the League promoted ceili dance, a process which continued during the 1930s and 1940s with the support of the Catholic Church in the form of the Public Dance Halls Act 1935.",
              "[1] The rise of rock and roll in the 1950s caused the popularity of set dancing to fade.",
              "However, in the 1980s a revival started and many sets that have not been done for forty years or more are being recovered and danced again.",
              "As the sets were often shown in special competitions under a choregraphied form (three or four figures had to be chosen to dance on the stage for instance), the popular version of the sets danced in the Ce\u0301ili\u0301 is often derived from this choreography and can be different from the original.",
              "For instance, the Connemara Reel Set was danced at first with only a reel figure and a jig figure.",
              "To be shown in competition it had to be truncated in more figures and now this is this version with three reel figures and a jig figure which is danced in the ce\u0301ilithe.",
              "To start, four couples are arranged in the form of a square to dance with each couple being in the middle of the sides of the square.",
              "Both the eight dancers in the group and the dance itself are called a \"set\".",
              "The dance is a sequence of several dance figures, which usually have a common theme or structure.",
              "The figures usually begin and end with repeated parts that everyone dances, and then during the figure each couple or pair of couples will dance separately.",
              "In the set, the couple with their backs to the band are traditionally named \"First Tops\" with \"Second Tops\" facing them.",
              "The couple on First Tops left hand side is called \"First Sides\" with \"Second Sides\" facing.",
              "Usually the First Tops are the first to dance, with some sets having First Sides and then Second Tops going next and some having Second Tops and then the First Sides.",
              "Second Sides is almost always the last couple to dance, and is therefore a good place for beginners to start, as they get more time to watch the demonstrations of the figure that the other couples give.",
              "Sets from a particular region usually have similar elements.",
              "For instance, sets from the Connemara region (such as the Connemara Reel Set, the South Galway Reel Set and the Claddagh Set) have the First Sides on the right of the First Tops, and sets from the Clare region often involve footwork similar to Irish traditional Stepdance or traditional freeform Sean-no\u0301s dance (which emphasizes a \"battering\" step).",
              "Distinctive sets and dance regions emerged in the course of the 19th century[2] and evolved as popular house dances separate from the more formal Irish step-dancing tradition.",
              "In some homesteads a kitchen pot was placed under the flag stones as an extra acoustical element for the house dance.",
              "[3] Sets differs from square dance and round dance in that it does not require a caller: the sequence of figures is predefined by the name of the set.",
              "In places with a large community of set dancers, like Ireland or New York City, it is usual for dances to be uncalled - that is, done with no calling - because most dancers already know the instructions for the common sets.",
              "However, at venues with larger numbers of occasional dancers, or for an unaccustomed or new set, a caller is often present to give instructions as the dance progresses, for those people who are not yet familiar with the set."

              "It can be performed solo or in groups.",
              "Aside from public dance performances, there are also stepdance competitions all over the world.",

              "In Irish dance culture, a Feis is a traditional Gaelic arts and culture festival.",
              "Costumes are considered important for stage presence in competition and performance Irish stepdance.",
              "In many cases, costumes are sold at high prices and can even be custom made.",
              "Each costume is different, with varying colors and patterns, designed to attract the judge's eye in competitions and the audience's eye in performance.",
              "General appearance beside the costume is also equally important.",
              "Female dancers would typically curl their hair before each competition or wear curled wigs, while male dancers would neatly style their hair to a shape to their liking.",
              "Poodle Socks are worn by female dancers while males wear plain black socks.",
              "Poodle socks are white socks that stretch to typically 1-4 inches above the ankle, depending on the dancers preference.",
              "They also have distinctive ribbing, and can be embroidered with gems. Riverdance, an Irish step-dancing performance in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest that later became a hugely successful theatrical production, greatly contributed to its popularity.",
              "Once Riverdance became a large production, it changed the way that Irish dance was performed and viewed.",
              "Now that entrepreneurs could capitalize on Irish culture, they were able to tweak it to the audience's liking.",
              "This meant adding a theatrical flair to the performance, including arm movements (as opposed to the previously rigid top half that dancers maintained) as well as sexualizing the dance and the costumes.",
              "To many, this was a betrayal of tradition, but to some, it was a way of expanding Irish culture and became widely accepted.",
              "Following after Riverdance was Lord of the Dance and many other theatrical productions based on Irish stepdance.",
              "Michael Flatley, an Irish stepdancer, became a well-known name within these shows.",
              "Two types of shoes are worn in Irish stepdance;",

              "The dances for soft shoe and hard shoe are different and go by different names.",
              "Different music with varying beats are played based on the dance, though each soft and hard shoe dances all share basic moves and rhythms. The dancing traditions of Ireland are likely to have grown in tandem with Irish traditional music.",
              "Its first roots may have been in Pre-Christian Ireland, but Irish dance was also partially influenced by dance forms on the Continent, especially the quadrille dances.",
              "Some of the earliest recorded references to Irish dance are to the Rinnce Fada or \"long dance\", towards the end of the 17th century, which was performed largely on social occasions.",
              "[1] Traveling dancing masters taught all over Ireland beginning around the 1750s and continuing as late as the early 1900s.",
              "[2] By the late 19th century, at least three related styles of step dance had developed in Ireland.",
              "The style practised in Munster saw dancers on the balls of their feet, using intricate percussive techniques to create complex rhythm.",
              "On the other hand, a tradition developed in Ulster saw dancers instead using their heel to create a persistent drumming effect, and primarily performing in pairs.",
              "The Connemara style, later described as sean-no\u0301s dance, combined heel and ball movements with the swaying of the torso and vigorous movement of the arms.[3] The foundation of the Gaelic League in 1893, an Irish nationalist body formed with the purpose of preserving traditional Irish language and culture, radically altered the cultural status of step dance.",
              "Frank Hall has described this as the moment in which \"step-Dancing in Ireland became 'Irish dancing'\", and as therefore the most significant single event in the development of the dance form.",
              "[4] Although informal competitions had long been held between towns and students of different dance masters, the first organised feis was held in 1897 by the League.",
              "[5] The League began to codify and promote the form of step dance which was practiced in southern areas.",
              "[2] This codification, practised from the early 1920s, greatly narrowed the range of traditional Irish dances acceptable in popular culture.",
              "[6] In 1927, the Gaelic League set up An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha (CLRG, the Irish Dancing Commission), a separate body dedicated to the organisation and standardisation of Irish dance.",
              "CLRG created certifications for dance teachers and began to hold examinations for adjudicators of feisanna.",
              "In the 19th century, the Irish diaspora had spread Irish dance all over the world, especially to North America and Australia.",
              "However, schools and feiseanna were not established until the early 1900s: in America these tended to be created within Irish-American urban communities, notably in Chicago and Massachusetts.",
              "The first classes in stepdancing were held there by the Philadelphia-born John McNamara.",

              "[8] The first television broadcast of Irish stepdance, on CBS in 1945, contributed to the increased popularity of a stepdance style originating in Ulster.",
              "This style, which incorporated balletic movements and high elevation on the toes, gradually usurped the Munster style with fast, low footwork which had prevailed up to that point.",
              "[9] The success of Riverdance and other dance shows in the late 20th century influenced the choreography and presentation of stepdance in both competitive and public performance environments.",
              "This included the use of simpler costumes and hairstyles for public performance in imitation of the Riverdance styles, and the development of new dance styles, such as hard shoe dances performed to music typically associated with soft shoes.",
              "[10] In competitive dance, movements from flamenco and figure skating began to be incorporated into traditional steps, although such developments were criticised by elements of the competitive dancing community.",
              "[11] The techniques involved in Irish stepdance are essentially similar across each of the individual dance styles.",
              "The basic style of modern step dance used in competitive contexts evolved from the stylistic features of traditional step dance in Munster.",
              "This style is largely performed on the balls of the feet with feet turned outwards.",
              "[12] Competitive dancers are judged on posture, timing, rhythm and execution, which in practice means a rigid torso, rapid and intricate footwork, and legs and feet crossed over each other, with knees close together.",
              "[13] Irish stepdances can be placed into two categories.",
              "Solos, which are danced by a single dancer, and ceilis or teams, which are coordinated with 2 or more dancers.",
              "Reel, slip jig, hornpipe, and jig are all types of Irish stepdances and are also types of Irish traditional music.",
              "These fall into two broad categories based on the shoes worn: 'hard shoe' and 'soft shoe' dances.",
              "Reels, which are in 24 or 44 time, and slip jigs, which are in 98 time and considered to be the lightest and most graceful of the dances, are soft shoe dances.",
              "[14][15] Hornpipes, which can be in 24 or 44 time, are danced in hard shoes.",
              "Three jigs are danced in competition;",

              "Light and single jigs are in 68 time, and are soft shoes dances, while the treble jig is hard shoe, danced in a slow 68.",
              "The last type of jig is the slip jig, which is danced in 98 time.",
              "There are many dances, which steps vary between schools.",
              "The traditional set dances (danced in hardshoe) like St.",
              "Patrick's Day and the Blackbird, among others, are the only dances that all schools have the same steps.",
              "The actual steps in Irish stepdance are usually unique to each school or dance teacher.",
              "Steps are developed by Irish dance teachers for students of their school.",
              "Each dance is built out of the same basic elements, or steps, but the dance itself is unique, and new dances and movements are being choreographed continuously.",
              "For this reason, videotaping of competitions is forbidden under the rules of An Coimisiun.",
              "Each step is a sequence of foot movements, leg movements and leaps, which lasts for 8 repetitions of 8 bars of music.",
              "It is traditional for each step to be performed first on the right foot and then on the left foot, then transferring to the next step.",
              "This practice leads to a large proportion of dancers exhibiting a preference for their right leg over their left in dance movements.",
              "[16] Hard shoe dancing includes clicking (striking the heels of the shoes against each other), trebles (the toe of the shoe striking the floor), stamps (the entire foot striking the floor), and an increasing number of complicated combinations of taps from the toes and heels.",
              "There are two types of hard shoe dance, the solo dances, which are the hornpipe and treble jig, and the set dances, which are also solo dances, despite having the same name as the social dances.",
              "Traditional set dances use the same choreography regardless of the school whereas contemporary sets are choreographed by the teachers.",
              "The music and steps for each traditional set was set down by past dance masters and passed down under An Coimisiu\u0301n auspices as part of the rich history of stepdancing, hence the \"traditional.\"",
              "There are about 40 sets used in modern stepdance, but the traditional sets performed in most levels of competition are St.",
              "Patrick's Day, the Blackbird, Job of Journeywork, Garden of Daisies, King of the Fairies, and Jockey to the Fair.",
              "The remaining traditional set dances are primarily danced at championship levels.",
              "These tunes vary in tempo to allow for more difficult steps for higher level dancers.",
              "An unusual feature of the set dance tune is that many are \"crooked\", with some of the parts, or sections, of the tunes departing from the common 8 bar formula.",

              "A 200-word story is read and followed by a six-minute dance performance including costumes, mime and facial expression.",
              "[18] Some dance schools recognised by An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha place as much emphasis on ce\u0301ili\u0301 dancing as on solo dancing, meticulously rehearsing the dances as written in the book and striving for perfect interpretation.",
              "In competition, figure dancers are expected to dance their routine in perfect unison, forming seamless yet intricate figures based on their positions relative to each other.",
              "The development of Irish stepdance costumes occurred throughout the 20th century alongside the dance style itself.",
              "Costumes were thus heavily influenced by the rules and competitive structures put in place by An Coimisiu\u0301n and other organisations.",

              "Hard shoes, also known as the heavy shoes or jig shoes, are leather shoes in the style of an Oxford shoe but with a toe piece similar to the cleat on a tap shoe as well an extended heel, both of which enable the production of rhythmic sounds.",
              "[20] Early 20th century dancers used a variety of shoes, including both those made of cowhide, which minimised sound production, and hobnail boots, which produced loud percussive sounds.",
              "[21] At this time, it was common for women to perform jigs and hornpipes in ordinary lightweight shoes, because their dances did not involve rhythmic percussion, but from the 1930s onward both men and women began to wear heavy leather shoes.",
              "[22] Although in Ireland, hard shoes were used only for heavy jigs and hornpipes, in Australia until the 1950s it was common practice to perform all dances in such heavy shoes.",
              "[23] After An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rince Gaelacha banned the use of metal heel or toe pieces in the 1940s, ordinary shoes were modified with nails, coins or gravel in order to improve the clarity of sound and to emphasise the rhythms of the heavy dances.",
              "[22][24] At this time, it was also common for heel and toe pieces to be improvised with several layers of leather stitched together in a tapered shape.",
              "[25] From the 1980s, toe pieces and heels were developed made from fibreglass or plastics, in response to lighter shoe leather with inferior sound production qualities, and with the aim of minimising damage caused to floors by nails.",
              "The lightweight nature of such materials allowed dancers to achieve more elevation in their steps,[20] and furthermore enabled entirely new movements to be incorporated into dances, such as pointe work in the balletic style on the very tip of the toe piece.",
              "A further innovation, the \"bubble heel\", which added an inwards protrusion to the hollow plastic heel, created a far louder sound when clicking the heels together than was possible in traditional leather-heeled shoes.",
              "[26] An Coimisiu\u0301n later outlawed bubble heels in competition, but plastic heels continued to enable \"click\" movements.",
              "Dancing en pointe was popularised further by the introduction of shoes with modified, more flexible soles.",
              "[26][27] The sound production qualities of shoes were further augmented by the radio microphones built into the toe for shows such as Riverdance.",
              "[28] At the end of the 20th century, a further development occurred in shoe design: the \"flexi\" sole, which removed the rigid \"spine\" from the base of the shoe, in an attempt to enable greater flexibility in the feet.",
              "However, concerns were raised by dance regulators that the lack of support would have an adverse impact on dancers' feet.",
              "[28] , in the shape of a shamrock or other It is common for an intricate but entirely cosmetic buckle to be added to hard shoes for competition.",
              "[29] Commercially available hard shoes are priced at between US$100 and $150.",
              "[30] Until the early 20th century, reels and slip jigs were performed in ordinary walking shoes, as with heavy jigs and hornpipes.",
              "Beginning at the dancing competition of the 1924 Tailteann Games in Dublin, a style of ballet pump held on by a looped piece of elastic was introduced for these dances.",
              "The increased popularity of these shoes over the following decades contributed to a more balletic style in the slip jig which eventually led to this dance being performed exclusively by women.",
              "[31] In the latter half of the 20th century, the pumps changed to a low cut type with crossed laces similar to the Scottish ghillie.",
              "This modern type of shoe, however, differs from the traditional Scottish footwear with a shorter toe box and round laces.",
              "A number of variations on this type are available, including variants with softer leather and split soles.",
              "[29] This change was motivated by a desire to highlight the position of feet to adjudicators, as the usual black colour of the pumps contrasted with the exposed white of the poodle socks.",
              "[31] The flexible nature of these shoes enables rapid and graceful movement as well as elevation in the dancer's performance.",
              "[20] These soft shoes cost around $40 when purchased new.",
              "[30] Until the 1970s, it was common for men to wear the pumps as well, particularly when competing in the slip jig, but at this time, An Coimisiu\u0301n introduced legislation restricting their use to boys under the age of 11.",
              "Consequently, a new style of shoe was adopted for men similar to the contemporary hard shoe, with the toe piece and ankle strap removed but the fibreglass heel retained.",
              "[32] This second type of soft shoe, often known as the \"reel shoe\", is worn exclusively by male dancers, although younger male dancers are occasionally encouraged to begin in jazz shoes which are similar apart from the heel.",
              "[29] From the late 1800s, when the Gaelic League began to organise cultural festivals to promote the cause of Irish nationalism, Irish step dance developed a competitive element.",
              "Throughout the 20th century, structures for competition developed and spread across the world.",
              "Several organisations, many of which at various stages separated from the Gaelic League's An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, independently organise Irish dancing competitions, both in Ireland and elsewhere.",
              "In addition to An Coimisiu\u0301n, Irish step dance is regulated by An Comhdha\u0301il na Mu\u0301inteoiri\u0301 le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, Cumann Rince Na\u0301isiu\u0301nta, the World Irish Dance Association, the Festival Irish Dance Teachers Association, and others.",
              "[33] A number of smaller organisations are described as \"open platform\", meaning that dancers and teachers may affiliate with and compete under other open platform organisations.",
              "Open platform organisations also adhere to broad mission statements rather than strict hierarchy, in an attempt to appeal to dance teachers wishing to remain independent.",
              "[33] An Coimisiu\u0301n and An Comhdha\u0301il are primarily closed to competitors from other organisations, but operate open platform competitions in areas with fewer members.",
              "[34] Irish step dance organisations generally require their teachers and adjudicators to be qualified by the governing body.",
              "Most follow the structure set by An Coimisiu\u0301n, the most important qualifications of which are the TCRG (qualification to teach) and the ADCRG (qualification to adjudicate).",
              "These qualifications are awarded by examinations which test practical and theoretical knowledge of traditional and original steps for both step dance and ceili dancing.",
              "[35][36] An Comhdha\u0301il and some other organisations recognise the qualifications awarded by An Coimisiu\u0301n,[37] but An Coimisiu\u0301n only recognises teachers and adjudicators qualified under their own examinations.",
              "[38] A feis (/\u02c8f\u025b\u0283/, plural feiseanna) is a competitive step dance event.",
              "The word \"feis\" means \"festival\" in Irish, and traditionally consists of dancing competitions as well as competition in music and traditional crafts.",
              "Many modern feiseanna, however, are solely Irish dancing events.",
              "[39] At a feis, several grades of competition are typically offered, in accordance with regional practice and the rules of the governing organisation.",
              "These grades may be based on a dancer's level of experience or their previous results in feiseanna.",
              "[40] A feis competition is generally judged by between one and three adjudicators, depending on the size of the event and local organisation rules.",
              "Dancers compete in sections of one solo dance at a time, and feiseanna may also include competitions for ceili dances.",
              "An oireachtas (plural oireachtais or oireachtasi) or championship competition is a larger and usually annual Irish dancing competition.",
              "The first oireachtas, established by the Gaelic League, was inspired by the Welsh eisteddfod and was conceived as an Irish national festival.",
              "[41] An oireachtas is often the highest-level competition for a region or country, such as Oireachtas Rince Na hEirann (The All-Ireland Championships) or the North American Irish Dancing Championships.",
              "Oireachtais operate at only one level of competition and are judged by multiple adjudicators.",
              "In An Coimisiu\u0301n oireachtais, dancers perform three dances in consecutive rounds and are placed according to their cumulative scores.",
              "Like feiseanna, oireachtais may include competitions for ceili dances.",
              "[42] Many of the larger organisations operate an annual World Championships for their organisation's dancers.",
              "[33] The largest and oldest of these is An Coimisiu\u0301n's Oireachtas Rince Na Cruinne, which was established in 1970, and involves up to 3000 competing dancers who have qualified at regional and national oireachtais.",
              "[42] At the 1897 general meeting of the Gaelic League, displays of dancing were observed to be more popular than the speeches and debates.",
              "The public performance of step dance, therefore, evolved with the organisation of social dances as a means for the Gaelic League to ensure both ongoing popularity and financial stability for its revolutionary activities.",
              "[43] Riverdance was the interval act in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest, held in Dublin, which contributed to the popularity of Irish stepdance, and is still considered a significant watershed in Irish culture.",
              "[44] Its roots are in a three-part suite of baroque-influenced traditional music called \"Timedance\", composed and recorded for the 1981 contest, which was also hosted in Dublin.",
              "This first performance featured American-born Irish dancing champions Jean Butler and Michael Flatley, the RTE\u0301 Concert Orchestra and the Celtic choral group Anu\u0301na with a score written by Bill Whelan.",

              "Today, it has reached a point where even people with no connection to Ireland are learning to dance.",
              "Irish dancing as we know it today evolved over centuries, but its roots stretch all the way back to the Celts, who danced around sacred trees as part of their religious celebrations.",
              "Later, the Normans arrived, bringing their own style of dancing to the towns they conquered and influencing local traditions.",

              "Around this time, League branches began to organise feiseanna (competitions) and so, within the space of a few short years, the twin phenomena of the Irish ce\u0301ili\u0301 and the feis were born.",

              "Some pointed out that set dancing had been practised in Ireland since the eighteenth century, but the Gaelic League was determined to retain only those dances that it considered uniquely Irish.",
              "The League also discouraged regional styles of dancing, focusing instead on teaching the Munster style with its rigid arms. Regional styles \u2013 such as the Galway sean-no\u0301s style with its low foot movements and extravagant arm gestures \u2013 were suppressed.",
              "Such dancers could not even compete in feiseanna organised by the Gaelic League.",

              "Nevertheless, the League organised ce\u0301ili\u0301s in town halls all over the country, with the support of the Catholic clergy who had long fretted about immoral goings-on at house dances.",
              "Around this time, the Gaelic League staged public demonstrations of Irish dancing both in Ireland and America.",
              "The dancers were dressed in costumes based on images from old manuscripts, with a tunic style dress and a cape.",

              "Millions had left Ireland during the previous century \u2013 in fact, it\u2019s estimated that one in every two people born in Ireland during the nineteenth century emigrated.",

              "Across America, Irish language classes reported smaller attendances than the music and dance evenings \u2013 clearly, people enjoyed these pursuits more than learning the language, and who could blame them?",
              "Irish cultural events were certainly capable of drawing crowds.",

              "Modern Step Dancing With the advent of Riverdance and Lord of the Dance, Irish dancing costumes became looser, less restrained and more relaxed, relying less on the heavy ornamentation of the traditional style and focussing more on the feet and the steps, and not distracted by embellishment.",

              "Social Dancing As many people know, ce\u0301ili\u0301s were of great significance to Irish people, serving an important social function for meeting friends and exchanging news back in the days before television, radio \u2013 originally they did not necessarily include dancing.",
              "Dancing often took place at crossroads when the weather was fair, as this was a large square suitable for the group dances.",

              "Set dancing is related to ce\u0301ili\u0301 dancing, but is more structured and formal.",

              "This form is danced low to the ground, and includes improvisation and rhythmic percussive steps with the feet.",
              "The dancer often has a much closer relationship with the musician, and has been referred to as \u2018the visual expression of the music and the musician\u2019, due to the use of hips, shoulders and arms as well as feet to accentuate points in the music.",
              "It was traditionally danced upon a wooden half-door or round barrel-top to produce hard clicks with the feet, and the confined space of today\u2019s sean-no\u0301s dancing is a remnant of that.",

              "Once Riverdance became a large production, it changed the way that Irish dance was performed and viewed.",
              "Now that entrepreneurs could capitalize on Irish culture, they were able to tweak it to the audience's liking.",

              "[1] Traveling dancing masters taught all over Ireland beginning around the 1750s and continuing as late as the early 1900s.",
              "[2] By the late 19th century, at least three related styles of step dance had developed in Ireland.",
              "The style practised in Munster saw dancers on the balls of their feet, using intricate percussive techniques to create complex rhythm.",
              "On the other hand, a tradition developed in Ulster saw dancers instead using their heel to create a persistent drumming effect, and primarily performing in pairs.",
              "The Connemara style, later described as sean-no\u0301s dance, combined heel and ball movements with the swaying of the torso and vigorous movement of the arms.[3] The foundation of the Gaelic League in 1893, an Irish nationalist body formed with the purpose of preserving traditional Irish language and culture, radically altered the cultural status of step dance.",
              "Frank Hall has described this as the moment in which \"step-Dancing in Ireland became 'Irish dancing'\", and as therefore the most significant single event in the development of the dance form.",
              "[4] Although informal competitions had long been held between towns and students of different dance masters, the first organised feis was held in 1897 by the League.",
              "[5] The League began to codify and promote the form of step dance which was practiced in southern areas.",
              "[2] This codification, practised from the early 1920s, greatly narrowed the range of traditional Irish dances acceptable in popular culture.",
              "[6] In 1927, the Gaelic League set up An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha (CLRG, the Irish Dancing Commission), a separate body dedicated to the organisation and standardisation of Irish dance.",
              "CLRG created certifications for dance teachers and began to hold examinations for adjudicators of feisanna.",
              "In the 19th century, the Irish diaspora had spread Irish dance all over the world, especially to North America and Australia.",
              "However, schools and feiseanna were not established until the early 1900s: in America these tended to be created within Irish-American urban communities, notably in Chicago and Massachusetts.",
              "The first classes in stepdancing were held there by the Philadelphia-born John McNamara.",
              "[7] According to the BBC's A Short History of Irish Dance, \"The nature of the Irish dance tradition has changed and adapted over the centuries to accommodate and reflect changing populations and the fusion of new cultures.",

              "[8] The first television broadcast of Irish stepdance, on CBS in 1945, contributed to the increased popularity of a stepdance style originating in Ulster.",
              "This style, which incorporated balletic movements and high elevation on the toes, gradually usurped the Munster style with fast, low footwork which had prevailed up to that point.",
              "[9] The success of Riverdance and other dance shows in the late 20th century influenced the choreography and presentation of stepdance in both competitive and public performance environments.",
              "This included the use of simpler costumes and hairstyles for public performance in imitation of the Riverdance styles, and the development of new dance styles, such as hard shoe dances performed to music typically associated with soft shoes.",
              "[10] In competitive dance, movements from flamenco and figure skating began to be incorporated into traditional steps, although such developments were criticised by elements of the competitive dancing community.",
              "[11] The techniques involved in Irish stepdance are essentially similar across each of the individual dance styles.",
              "The basic style of modern step dance used in competitive contexts evolved from the stylistic features of traditional step dance in Munster.",
              "This style is largely performed on the balls of the feet with feet turned outwards.",
              "[12] Competitive dancers are judged on posture, timing, rhythm and execution, which in practice means a rigid torso, rapid and intricate footwork, and legs and feet crossed over each other, with knees close together.",
              "[13] Irish stepdances can be placed into two categories.",
              "Solos, which are danced by a single dancer, and ceilis or teams, which are coordinated with 2 or more dancers.",

              "Three types of shoes are worn in competitive step dancing: hard shoes and two kinds of soft shoe.",
              "Hard shoes, also known as the heavy shoes or jig shoes, are leather shoes in the style of an Oxford shoe but with a toe piece similar to the cleat on a tap shoe as well an extended heel, both of which enable the production of rhythmic sounds.",
              "[20] Early 20th century dancers used a variety of shoes, including both those made of cowhide, which minimised sound production, and hobnail boots, which produced loud percussive sounds.",
              "[21] At this time, it was common for women to perform jigs and hornpipes in ordinary lightweight shoes, because their dances did not involve rhythmic percussion, but from the 1930s onward both men and women began to wear heavy leather shoes.",
              "[22] Although in Ireland, hard shoes were used only for heavy jigs and hornpipes, in Australia until the 1950s it was common practice to perform all dances in such heavy shoes.",
              "[23] After An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rince Gaelacha banned the use of metal heel or toe pieces in the 1940s, ordinary shoes were modified with nails, coins or gravel in order to improve the clarity of sound and to emphasise the rhythms of the heavy dances.",
              "[22][24] At this time, it was also common for heel and toe pieces to be improvised with several layers of leather stitched together in a tapered shape.",
              "[25] From the 1980s, toe pieces and heels were developed made from fibreglass or plastics, in response to lighter shoe leather with inferior sound production qualities, and with the aim of minimising damage caused to floors by nails.",
              "The lightweight nature of such materials allowed dancers to achieve more elevation in their steps,[20] and furthermore enabled entirely new movements to be incorporated into dances, such as pointe work in the balletic style on the very tip of the toe piece.",
              "A further innovation, the \"bubble heel\", which added an inwards protrusion to the hollow plastic heel, created a far louder sound when clicking the heels together than was possible in traditional leather-heeled shoes.",
              "[26] An Coimisiu\u0301n later outlawed bubble heels in competition, but plastic heels continued to enable \"click\" movements.",
              "Dancing en pointe was popularised further by the introduction of shoes with modified, more flexible soles.",
              "[26][27] The sound production qualities of shoes were further augmented by the radio microphones built into the toe for shows such as Riverdance.",
              "[28] At the end of the 20th century, a further development occurred in shoe design: the \"flexi\" sole, which removed the rigid \"spine\" from the base of the shoe, in an attempt to enable greater flexibility in the feet.",
              "However, concerns were raised by dance regulators that the lack of support would have an adverse impact on dancers' feet.",
              "[28] , in the shape of a shamrock or other It is common for an intricate but entirely cosmetic buckle to be added to hard shoes for competition.",
              "[29] Commercially available hard shoes are priced at between US$100 and $150.",
              "[30] Until the early 20th century, reels and slip jigs were performed in ordinary walking shoes, as with heavy jigs and hornpipes.",
              "Beginning at the dancing competition of the 1924 Tailteann Games in Dublin, a style of ballet pump held on by a looped piece of elastic was introduced for these dances.",
              "The increased popularity of these shoes over the following decades contributed to a more balletic style in the slip jig which eventually led to this dance being performed exclusively by women.",
              "[31] In the latter half of the 20th century, the pumps changed to a low cut type with crossed laces similar to the Scottish ghillie.",
              "This modern type of shoe, however, differs from the traditional Scottish footwear with a shorter toe box and round laces.",
              "A number of variations on this type are available, including variants with softer leather and split soles.",
              "[29] This change was motivated by a desire to highlight the position of feet to adjudicators, as the usual black colour of the pumps contrasted with the exposed white of the poodle socks.",
              "[31] The flexible nature of these shoes enables rapid and graceful movement as well as elevation in the dancer's performance.",
              "[20] These soft shoes cost around $40 when purchased new.",
              "[30] Until the 1970s, it was common for men to wear the pumps as well, particularly when competing in the slip jig, but at this time, An Coimisiu\u0301n introduced legislation restricting their use to boys under the age of 11.",
              "Consequently, a new style of shoe was adopted for men similar to the contemporary hard shoe, with the toe piece and ankle strap removed but the fibreglass heel retained.",
              "[32] This second type of soft shoe, often known as the \"reel shoe\", is worn exclusively by male dancers, although younger male dancers are occasionally encouraged to begin in jazz shoes which are similar apart from the heel.",
              "[29] From the late 1800s, when the Gaelic League began to organise cultural festivals to promote the cause of Irish nationalism, Irish step dance developed a competitive element.",
              "Throughout the 20th century, structures for competition developed and spread across the world.",
              "Several organisations, many of which at various stages separated from the Gaelic League's An Coimisiu\u0301n Le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, independently organise Irish dancing competitions, both in Ireland and elsewhere.",
              "In addition to An Coimisiu\u0301n, Irish step dance is regulated by An Comhdha\u0301il na Mu\u0301inteoiri\u0301 le Rinci\u0301 Gaelacha, Cumann Rince Na\u0301isiu\u0301nta, the World Irish Dance Association, the Festival Irish Dance Teachers Association, and others.",
              "[33] A number of smaller organisations are described as \"open platform\", meaning that dancers and teachers may affiliate with and compete under other open platform organisations.",
              "Open platform organisations also adhere to broad mission statements rather than strict hierarchy, in an attempt to appeal to dance teachers wishing to remain independent.",
              "[33] An Coimisiu\u0301n and An Comhdha\u0301il are primarily closed to competitors from other organisations, but operate open platform competitions in areas with fewer members.",
              "[34] Irish step dance organisations generally require their teachers and adjudicators to be qualified by the governing body.",
              "Most follow the structure set by An Coimisiu\u0301n, the most important qualifications of which are the TCRG (qualification to teach) and the ADCRG (qualification to adjudicate).",
              "These qualifications are awarded by examinations which test practical and theoretical knowledge of traditional and original steps for both step dance and ceili dancing.",
              "[35][36] An Comhdha\u0301il and some other organisations recognise the qualifications awarded by An Coimisiu\u0301n,[37] but An Coimisiu\u0301n only recognises teachers and adjudicators qualified under their own examinations.",

              "The word \"feis\" means \"festival\" in Irish, and traditionally consists of dancing competitions as well as competition in music and traditional crafts.",
              "Many modern feiseanna, however, are solely Irish dancing events.",
              "[39] At a feis, several grades of competition are typically offered, in accordance with regional practice and the rules of the governing organisation.",
              "These grades may be based on a dancer's level of experience or their previous results in feiseanna.",
