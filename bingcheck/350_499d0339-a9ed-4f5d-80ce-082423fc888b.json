    "query": "What is the process behind developing and testing new medicines, and how do researchers ensure their safety and efficacy before they are approved for use in humans?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Developing and testing new medicines is a complex, lengthy and expensive process that involves several steps to ensure their safety and efficacy before they are approved for use in humans[^1^] [^2^].\n\nAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the process can be summarized as follows[^1^]:\n\n- **Step 1: Discovery and Development**. Researchers discover new drugs through various methods, such as studying the disease process, screening molecular compounds, or modifying existing treatments. They then test the drugs in the laboratory and in animals to evaluate their potential benefits and risks[^3^].\n- **Step 2: Preclinical Research**. Drugs that show promise in the laboratory and animal studies are submitted to the FDA for approval to start testing in humans. The FDA reviews the data and ensures that the drugs meet certain criteria for safety and quality[^1^].\n- **Step 3: Clinical Research**. Drugs that pass the preclinical stage are tested in humans in three phases of clinical trials. Phase I trials involve a small group of healthy volunteers to assess the safety, dosage, and side effects of the drug. Phase II trials involve a larger group of patients with the target disease to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and optimal dose of the drug. Phase III trials involve a much larger group of patients with the target disease to confirm the effectiveness, monitor the side effects, compare the drug with other treatments, and collect information for labeling and use of the drug[^1^].\n- **Step 4: FDA Review**. After completing the clinical trials, the drug maker submits a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA, which contains all the data and information about the drug, including its formulation, manufacturing process, results of animal and human studies, proposed labeling, and more. The FDA review teams thoroughly examine all the submitted data and determine whether the drug's benefits outweigh its known and potential risks for the intended population. If the FDA approves the NDA, the drug can be marketed in the United States[^1^] [^2^].\n- **Step 5: FDA Post-Market Safety Monitoring**. After a drug is approved and available for use by the public, the FDA continues to monitor its safety and effectiveness through various sources, such as reports from health care professionals and patients, studies conducted by drug makers or other researchers, and databases that track drug use patterns and outcomes. The FDA can take actions to address any safety issues that arise, such as requiring changes in labeling, issuing safety alerts, or withdrawing the drug from the market if necessary[^1^].\n\nAs you can see, developing and testing new medicines is a rigorous and regulated process that aims to ensure their safety and efficacy before they are approved for use in humans.",

              "A repositioned drug does not require the initial 6\u20139 years typically required for the development of new drugs by traditional process, but instead enters directly to preclinical testing and clinical trials, thus reducing the overall risk, time and cost of development.",
              "Reports suggest that repurposed drugs require approximately 3\u201312 years for gaining approval from FDA and/or European Medicines Agency (EMA) and at reduced 50\u201360% cost.",

              ", and clinical efficacy and safety information is already available, as the candidate drug has already undergone through the early stages of drug development such as structural optimization, preclinical and/or clinical trials, in addition to the possibility of the candidate drug being an approved drug, having its clinical efficacy and safety profile.",
              "In this way, there is a reduction of the risks associated with failures in the early stages of development, which are high in traditional approaches, as well as a significant reduction of cost with the possible increase in clinical safety and therefore, high success rate [13, 14].",
              "Due to the availability of previously collected pharmacokinetic, toxicological, clinical and safety data at the start of a repurposing development project, the advantages that are encountered with drug repurposing over traditional drug discovery approach are reduced time of development, lower cost of development and reduced risks of failure in the clinical development.",
              "It has been estimated that the time required for development of a repositioned drug varies from 3 to 12 years (which is about 10\u201317 years in traditional discovery program) with substantially lower costs, which ensures the repositioning company\u2019s significant savings in terms of time and capital.",

              "2 Although it is widely accepted that medicine should be evidence based, animal experimentation as a means of informing human health has generally not been held, in practice, to this standard.",
              "This fact makes it surprising that animal experimentation is typically viewed as the default and gold standard of preclinical testing and is generally supported without critical examination of its validity.",
              "A survey published in 2008 of anecdotal cases and statements given in support of animal experimentation demonstrates how it has not and could not be validated as a necessary step in biomedical research, and the survey casts doubt on its predictive value.",
              "3 I show that animal experimentation is poorly predictive of human outcomes,4 that it is unreliable across a wide category of disease areas,5 and that existing literature demonstrates the unreliability of animal experimentation, thereby undermining scientific arguments in its favor.",

              "39 The main causes of failure are lack of effectiveness and safety problems that were not predicted by animal tests.",
              "40 Usually, when an animal model is found wanting, various reasons are proffered to explain what went wrong\u2014poor methodology, publication bias, lack of preexisting disease and medications, wrong gender or age, and so on.",
              "These factors certainly require consideration, and recognition of each potential difference between the animal model and the human disease motivates renewed efforts to eliminate these differences.",
              "As a result, scientific progress is sometimes made by such efforts.",

              "41 Ultimately, even if considerable congruence were shown between an animal model and its corresponding human disease, interspecies differences in physiology, behavior, pharmacokinetics, and genetics would significantly limit the reliability of animal studies, even after a substantial investment to improve such studies.",
              "In spinal cord injury, for example, drug testing results vary according to which species and even which strain within a species is used, because of numerous interspecies and interstrain differences in neurophysiology, anatomy, and behavior.",

              "44 In one study, responses to 12 different behavioral measures of pain sensitivity, which are important markers of spinal cord injury, varied among 11 strains of mice, with no clear-cut patterns that allowed prediction of how each strain would respond.",

              "46 Further exemplifying the importance of physiological differences among species, a 2013 study reported that the mouse models used extensively to study human inflammatory diseases (in sepsis, burns, infection, and trauma) have been misleading.",

              "49 Gene regulation can substantially differ among species and may be as important as the presence or absence of a specific gene.",
              "Despite the high degree of genome conservation, there are critical differences in the order and function of genes among species.",
              "To use an analogy: as pianos have the same keys, humans and other animals share (largely) the same genes.",
              "Where we mostly differ is in the way the genes or keys are expressed.",

              "Recognizing the inherent genetic differences among species as a barrier to translation, researches have expressed considerable enthusiasm for genetically modified (GM) animals, including transgenic mice models, wherein human genes are inserted into the mouse genome.",
              "However, if a human gene is expressed in mice, it will likely function differently from the way it functions in humans, being affected by physiological mechanisms that are unique in mice.",

              "50 When the human gene that makes this protein was expressed in genetically altered mice, it had the opposite effect from that in humans: it caused loss of blood sugar control in mice.",
              "Use of GM mice has failed to successfully model human diseases and to translate into clinical benefit across many disease categories.",
              "51 Perhaps the primary reason why GM animals are unlikely to be much more successful than other animal models in translational medicine is the fact that the \u201chumanized\u201d or altered genes are still in nonhuman animals.",
              "In many instances, nonhuman primates (NHPs) are used instead of mice or other animals, with the expectation that NHPs will better mimic human results.",
              "However, there have been sufficient failures in translation to undermine this optimism.",
              "For example, NHP models have failed to reproduce key features of Parkinson\u2019s disease, both in function and in pathology.",

              "55 After HIV vaccine gp120 failed in clinical trials, despite positive outcomes in chimpanzees, a BMJ article commented that important differences between NHPs and humans with HIV misled researchers, taking them down unproductive experimental paths.",
              "56 Gp120 failed to neutralize HIV grown and tested in cell culture.",
              "However, because the serum protected chimpanzees from HIV infection, two Phase 3 clinical trials were undertaken57\u2014a clear example of how expectations that NHP data are more predictive than data from other (in this case, cell culture) testing methods are unproductive and harmful.",
              "Despite the repeated failures, NHPs (though not chimpanzees or other great apes) remain widely used for HIV research.",

              "Imprecise results from animal experiments may result in clinical trials of biologically faulty or even harmful substances, thereby exposing patients to unnecessary risk and wasting scarce research resources.",

              "66 As seen in some of the preceding examples (in particular, stroke, HRT, and TGN1412), humans have been significantly harmed because investigators were misled by the safety and efficacy profile of a new drug based on animal experiments.",
              "67 Clinical trial volunteers are thus provided with raised hopes and a false sense of security because of a misguided confidence in efficacy and safety testing using animals.",
              "An equal if indirect source of human suffering is the opportunity cost of abandoning promising drugs because of misleading animal tests.",

              "e., negative efficacy and/or positive adverse effects).",
              "Because much pharmaceutical company preclinical data are proprietary and thus publicly unavailable, it is difficult to know the number of missed opportunities due to misleading animal experiments.",
              "However, of every 5,000\u201310,000 potential drugs investigated, only about 5 proceed to Phase 1 clinical trials.",

              "71 Treatments that fail to work or show some adverse effect in animals because of species-specific influences may be abandoned in preclinical testing even if they may have proved effective and safe in humans if allowed to continue through the drug development pipeline.",
              "An editorial in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery describes cases involving two drugs in which animal test results from species-specific influences could have derailed their development.",
              "In particular, it describes how tamoxifen, one of the most effective drugs for certain types of breast cancer, \u201cwould most certainly have been withdrawn from the pipeline\u201d if its propensity to cause liver tumor in rats had been discovered in preclinical testing rather than after the drug had been on the market for years.",
              "72 Gleevec provides another example of effective drugs that could have been abandoned based on misleading animal tests: this drug, which is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), showed serious adverse effects in at least five species tested, including severe liver damage in dogs.",
              "However, liver toxicity was not detected in human cell assays, and clinical trials proceeded, which confirmed the absence of significant liver toxicity in humans.",
              "73 Fortunately for CML patients, Gleevec is a success story of predictive human-based testing.",
              "Many useful drugs that have safely been used by humans for decades, such as aspirin and penicillin, may not have been available today if the current animal testing regulatory requirements were in practice during their development.",
              "74 A further example of near-missed opportunities is provided by experiments on animals that delayed the acceptance of cyclosporine, a drug widely and successfully used to treat autoimmune disorders and prevent organ transplant rejection.",
              "75 Its immunosuppressive effects differed so markedly among species that researchers judged that the animal results limited any direct inferences that could be made to humans.",
              "Providing further examples, PharmaInformatic released a report describing how several blockbuster drugs, including aripiprazole (Abilify) and esomeprazole (Nexium), showed low oral bioavailability in animals.",
              "They would likely not be available on the market today if animal tests were solely relied on.",
              "Understanding the implications of its findings for drug development in general, PharmaInformatic asked, \u201cWhich other blockbuster drugs would be on the market today, if animal trials would have not been used to preselect compounds and drug-candidates for further development?",
              "\u201d76 These near-missed opportunities and the overall 96 percent failure rate in clinical drug testing strongly suggest the unsoundness of animal testing as a precondition of human clinical trials and provide powerful evidence for the need for a new, human-based paradigm in medical research and drug development.",
              "In addition to potentially causing abandonment of useful treatments, use of an invalid animal disease model can lead researchers and the industry in the wrong research direction, wasting time and significant investment.",
              "77 Repeatedly, researchers have been lured down the wrong line of investigation because of information gleaned from animal experiments that later proved to be inaccurate, irrelevant, or discordant with human biology.",

              "Funding must be strategically invested in the research areas that offer the most promise.",
              "The opportunity costs of continuing to fund unreliable animal tests may impede development of more accurate testing methods.",
              "Human organs grown in the lab, human organs on a chip, cognitive computing technologies, 3D printing of human living tissues, and the Human Toxome Project are examples of new human-based technologies that are garnering widespread enthusiasm.",
              "The benefit of using these testing methods in the preclinical setting over animal experiments is that they are based on human biology.",
              "Thus their use eliminates much of the guesswork required when attempting to extrapolate physiological data from other species to humans.",
              "Additionally, these tests offer whole-systems biology, in contrast to traditional in vitro techniques.",
              "Although they are gaining momentum, these human-based tests are still in their relative infancy, and funding must be prioritized for their further development.",
              "The recent advancements made in the development of more predictive, human-based systems and biological approaches in chemical toxicological testing are an example of how newer and improved tests have been developed because of a shift in prioritization.",
              "78 Apart from toxicology, though, financial investment in the development of human-based technologies generally falls far short of investment in animal experimentation.",
              "79 The unreliability of applying animal experimental results to human biology and diseases is increasingly recognized.",
              "Animals are in many respects biologically and psychologically similar to humans, perhaps most notably in the shared characteristics of pain, fear, and suffering.",
              "80 In contrast, evidence demonstrates that critically important physiological and genetic differences between humans and other animals can invalidate the use of animals to study human diseases, treatments, pharmaceuticals, and the like.",
              "In significant measure, animal models specifically, and animal experimentation generally, are inadequate bases for predicting clinical outcomes in human beings in the great bulk of biomedical science.",

              "The data showing the unreliability of animal experimentation and the resultant harms to humans (and nonhumans) undermine long-standing claims that animal experimentation is necessary to enhance human health and therefore ethically justified.",

              "It is possible\u2014as I have argued elsewhere\u2014that animal research is more costly and harmful, on the whole, than it is beneficial to human health.",
              "81 When considering the ethical justifiability of animal experiments, we should ask if it is ethically acceptable to deprive humans of resources, opportunity, hope, and even their lives by seeking answers in what may be the wrong place.",

              "Although documenting and measuring harm are the primary purposes of Phase I trials, the process is plagued with ambiguity and problems. Identifying a drug-related harm \u2013 as opposed to an AE \u2013 requires first recognizing a bodily change, either through physiological markers or participants\u2019 self-report.",

Still, these published cases of AEs in Phase I trials provide little insight into how healthy volunteers themselves perceive the significance of these harms. Most healthy volunteers enroll in Phase I trials despite the risk of harm in order to receive the financial compensation.",
              "12 Because participants are normally required to consent to a confinement period in a residential research clinic for some portion of, if not the entire, clinical trial,13 these studies typically pay $100-300 per day.",

              "\u201d And the first thing I think of is, you know, in those cases, like, \u201cAre these people just trying to kind of weasel out [of the study]?",
              "\u201d Because they know that there\u2019s a policy in place where, you know, if you can\u2019t participate or they drop you for any reason, then you get full compensation if it\u2019s, you know, an AE from the drug.",
              "I think sometimes people just play that out, see how that goes just to kind of, you know, say, \u201cHey, listen, I don\u2019t want to be here for a whole month if I don\u2019t have to or whatever.",
              "\u201d Travis\u2019 view of others\u2019 AEs is particularly striking because any bodily changes that would result in a participant\u2019s removal from a study could generally be considered serious harms. Yet, because of the prohibition on sharing information about AEs, researchers rarely communicate any information about other participants, which creates fertile ground for participants to deny that any harm has occurred.",
              "By instead positioning others\u2019 AEs as fabrications, participants maintained their own sense of the overall safety of Phase I trials, justifying their decision to continue to enroll, perhaps as in Travis\u2019 case for decades.",
              "While AEs were routinely dismissed as insignificant or imaginary, there were times in which participants did acknowledge that their or others\u2019 bodily changes were real and painful.",
              "Yet, they often chose to explain these AEs as caused by some factor other than the study drug.",
              "They instead attributed AEs to the clinic environment, the restrictions associated with the clinical trial, or other participants\u2019 deceptive practices \u2013 such as lying about their medical histories or past trial participation \u2013 that made them more vulnerable to AEs.",
              "As this section illustrates, these interpretations of distressing AEs similarly function as a mechanism for participants to avoid altering their perceptions of the safety of Phase I trials.",
              "Because of the required study confinement period, participants often perceived AEs as caused by the artificial environment to which they were subjected.",
              "For example, rather than experiencing a side effect of the study drug, they might argue that fatigue or somnolence was due to their inactivity, boredom, or change in sleeping arrangements.",
              "Similarly, the study diet provided an alternative explanation for gastrointestinal changes, even when those symptoms were common among participants.",
              "Reflecting on the only clinical trial she had done, Jennifer, an unemployed white woman, expressed ambivalence about the cause of a distressing AE she had experienced: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that [back pain] was because of the [study] medication or if it was because the hospital beds were terrible.",
              "\u201d Because only one other person in her study had a similar AE, Jennifer added, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of debatable as to whether or not it had anything to do with the medication itself.",
              "\u201d In some instances, there is indeed a lot of ambiguity surrounding the cause of AEs.",
              "The nearly universal prohibition on caffeine during Phase I trials is an example of a study restriction that certainly can cause participants to experience withdrawal headaches when they are used to regular caffeine consumption.",
              "At the same time, however, headaches are regularly listed as a potential risk of the study drug.",
              "Recognizing this ambiguity becomes a way for participants to explain away drug-related harm.",
              "When asked about AEs, Steve, a white full-time study participant, responded: It\u2019s pretty rare [for me to experience AEs], really.",
              "I get headaches in almost every study, but that tends to be more from caffeine withdrawal.",
              "And so I can\u2019t know for certain that it\u2019s from the drug, even though almost every informed consent [form] will list headaches as a potential side effect.",
              "I doubt that\u2019s why I\u2019m getting the headaches.",
              "It\u2019s most likely the caffeine withdrawal.",
              "Most notable about Steve\u2019s dismissal of the study drug causing his headaches is his explicit acknowledgment of the consent form detailing headaches as a potential risk of participation.",
              "As someone who relied on clinical trials for his entire income, it perhaps behooved Steve to blame the study restrictions instead of the investigational drugs for these painful AEs.",
              "In addition to attributing their own AEs to non-drug-related factors, participants interpreted AEs experienced by other participants this way.",
              "In these cases, they were able to invent possibilities for why one participant might have experienced a more severe outcome than others.",
              "However, when they did so, they often assumed these other participants had lied in order to qualify for the trial, broke the clinic rules, or failed to observe restrictions during the study itself.",
              "As with the discounting of other participants\u2019 AEs we described above, this perspective casts other participants as dishonest and deceptive.",
              "Plus, it engages in a blame-the-victim narrative that dismisses the possibility that the participant her- or himself might also be at risk when witnessing or hearing secondhand about serious AEs.",
              "The following excerpt from Everett, an unemployed black man who had participated in trials regularly for the past 6 years, demonstrates that this narrative can be maintained even in cases of witnessing frightening AEs: This one guy, he stopped breathing.",
              "I remember it was down in [clinic] last year.",
              "They did a code blue on this guy.",
              "He stopped breathing, and [they] took him downstairs to the emergency room .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "Maybe he took some [illicit] drugs, or maybe he lied when he came in, and he was taking other things and wasn\u2019t supposed to.",
              "There\u2019s a lot of people [who] do that when they doing studies.",
              "They go take supplemental things, you know, as a upper to get \u2018em ready for the next study.",
              "Some people go study hopping, and they do too many at one time.",
              "You know what I mean?",
              "So, if you do that, do too many at one time, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen.",
              "Your body\u2019s not gonna be ready for it.",
              "In this example, it is notable that Everett tried to explain the distressing AE he witnessed by offering multiple explanations for the event without ever speculating that it could be a direct result of the study drug itself.",
              "Implicit in Everetts\u2019 account is his knowledge that trials have measures in place to maintain a controlled environment, permitting conjecture that breaches in these standards are responsible for AEs.",
              "This type of speculation can prevent participants from fearing the study drugs themselves, believing that following the rules alleviates the risk of harm.",
              "This perception can also attenuate feelings of concern for other participants, viewing them as responsible for, and possibly deserving of, any harm that occurs due to their deceptive practices.",
              "Secondhand stories about harmful AEs were all the more likely to contain narratives of blameworthy individuals who lied to get into studies or who cheated thereafter.",
              "These stories could then also serve as cautionary tales to remind participants to follow trial protocols, especially when the financial compensation could prompt healthy volunteers to bend the rules as a means to maximize their earnings.",
              "22 Perhaps most indicative of participants\u2019 desire to maintain the reality that AEs can be explained by participant wrongdoings, rather than unfortunate drug reactions, was their retelling of Phase I tragedies about which they had heard from news sources.",
              "We have already noted that participants do not receive much information about AEs during trials from the research staff, but news reports, in contrast, often contain details about what might have caused AEs when participants are injured or have died.",
              "Referencing the infamous immunotherapy study that took place on healthy volunteers in London in 2006, Tammy, a self-employed white woman who used studies to help cover her bills, reported, You know, the one [study] that really sticks in my mind was hearing about these people in England that had done a study and they all swole up and died, and the reason\u2013they, they figured out\u2013was because they\u2019d gone straight from one study to another and they had drugs in their system [from the prior study] that interacted badly with the new drug they were given.",
              "And I think actually in Europe they [now] make you wait two months between studies because of that horrible thing that happened.",
              "Tammy\u2019s retelling of the first-in-human trial for theralizumab contains several factual errors.",
              "Specifically, none of the healthy volunteers died, but they did experience life-threatening cytokine storm reactions that resulted in multiple organ failure and some were left with permanent body disfigurements.",
              "23 Additionally, post-trial investigations of the tragedy confirmed that the AEs were an unforeseen drug reaction that had not been predicted in prior nonhuman animal testing,24 not that the participants had done anything themselves to provoke the AEs.",
              "Despite the news reports, Tammy distorted the case by linking the AEs to participant misconduct.",
              "This misrepresentation of the trial, as with all instances of participants blaming other healthy volunteers who experienced AEs, dismisses the risks of Phase I trials and helps participants to avoid questioning the safety of testing investigational drugs.",
              "As we have now illustrated, many of our participants experienced or witnessed symptoms that involved some level of discomfort during their Phase I trial participation.",
              "Yet, it was very uncommon for them to identify these AEs as significant and caused by the study drug itself.",
              "When participants did describe their AEs in terms that conveyed that the bodily changes were actually drug-related harms, the following exception to the rule brings into focus why the majority of participants might prefer their different interpretations.",
              "Because study enrollment is voluntary, understanding an AE as related to the trial requires participants to acknowledge that they knowingly exposed themselves to harm.",
              "This comes across in the case of Timothy, a white participant who described himself as financially stable and reported a yearly household income over $100,000.",
              "Timothy suffered an alarming AE in his first and only Phase I trial.",
              "Enrolled as a healthy volunteer in an outpatient study of an investigational drug for diabetes, he lost a significant amount of weight and was ultimately taken to a hospital\u2019s emergency department after passing out at work.",
              "In spite of the fact that he was informed about the risks prior to enrolling, he decided to participate in the study because he did not expect to be harmed, recalling, \u201c[I] figured my body would handle whatever was put in me.",
              "\u201d Timothy had no doubts that his AE was caused by the study drug, and even a year following the incident and his return to full health, he continued to regret his decision to enroll: \u201cYeah, it really made me sick, and.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "had I known those side effects would have happened [to me], I would not have done the study.",
              "\u201d Without hesitation, he added, \u201cI\u2019m really not inclined to do any more.",
              "\u201d Timothy was explicit in linking his decision not to enroll in future studies to the harm he experienced, but he further justified his position by rejecting the importance of the economic benefit he could receive from trial participation: \u201cThe other thing was it was kind of some supplemental income, and that\u2019s not necessary at this point.",
              "\u201d In rationalizing why he had put himself in harm\u2019s way through study participation, Timothy excused his initial decision to enroll in a clinical trial by claiming ignorance about the potential to personally suffer any negative consequences.",
              "25 After his experience of a frightening AE, this excuse could only remain plausible as long as he did not participate in additional studies.",
              "Fortunately for Timothy, his financial stability further enabled him to stop participating in studies and might help to explain why he, unlike so many other participants, acknowledged his AE as harmful and believed it was caused by the trial.",
              "This point of view departs radically from that of many of the participants who denied that AEs were forms of harms. The difference between these two perspectives illustrates how harm is ultimately a fuzzy construction that relies heavily on individuals\u2019 interpretations, which in turn may be shaped by their trial experience and reliance on trial income.",
              "By exploring participants\u2019 narratives of their AE experiences in Phase I trials, we demonstrate the ambiguity that surrounds research harms in this context.",
              "There are no clear-cut definitions that map harm onto objective bodily changes or experiences healthy volunteers might have over the course of their participation.",
              "Instead, the structure of these clinical trials provides participants with the opportunity to interpret their own and others\u2019 AEs as related to the study drug or, instead, to other factors.",
              "As we have illustrated, participants\u2019 discussions of AEs downplay the possibility and magnitude of experienced harm by portraying bodily changes as insignificant, imagined, fabricated, or unrelated to the study drug.",
              "They do this by comparing relatively minor AEs to the greater risks outlined in informed consent forms, by blaming the confinement period for their discomfort, and by assuming that other participants are dishonest.",
              "These interpretations function to minimize, deny, or re-attribute the cause of AEs in order to avoid perceiving them as instances of harm.",
              "Our findings underscore the importance of acknowledging how the research environment assists in shaping and maintaining ambiguity about the potential risks of harm in clinical trial participation.",
              "By dissociating the experience of AEs from harm, healthy volunteers avoid needing to reevaluate the possible risks of trial participation.",
              "This might be in their financial interest if they wish to continue enrolling in trials, but it poses ethical dilemmas for researchers and for research oversight bodies charged with risk mitigation and management of research-related harms. First, it raises questions about the ability of the informed consent process to communicate effectively about risk when actual participants engage in a process of denying how those risks translate into bodily harms. Second, by perceiving AEs as insignificant or imagined, participants might be disinclined to report bodily changes to research staff, which would undermine a critical function of Phase I trials.",
              "26 Put another way, flawed accountings of harm potentially jeopardize both the protection of research participants and the trustworthiness of trial results.",
              "Additionally, in demonstrating that participants typically do not recognize AEs as indicative of safety concerns, it casts in a new light the lack of information provided to healthy volunteers about trial results.",
              "While there might be clear scientific value in collecting data on all AEs without attributing causation during the clinical trial itself, it is more difficult to justify why participants remain ignorant about which AEs are later identified as drug side effects.",
              "Return of results has become a larger ethical conundrum in research,27 but this information could be especially meaningful in Phase I trials.",
              "Because healthy volunteers often enroll serially in these trials, learning how their AEs were later classified could benefit the informed consent process for their future trial participation.",
              "Although AEs in one trial should not be extrapolated to the next, participants might be more sensitized to study risks by ascertaining that previous bodily changes they or others experienced were indeed drug effects.",
              "If results were shared in this way, participants might also be more apt to interpret future AEs as potential harms and in turn reevaluate the safety of participation in general.",
              "While this might make it more difficult for researchers to enroll healthy volunteers in Phase I trials, it would provide more meaningful informed consent in the context of serial participation.",
              "Without such a change to more rigorously inform healthy volunteers about the likelihood of suffering drug-related harm, participants\u2019 interpretations of their AEs problematically contribute to a wider narrative downplaying Phase I trial risks.",
              "Evinced in recent commentaries that laud the safety of healthy volunteer trials,28 the bodily changes that participants routinely experience are rarely reflected upon as harms. Without such a framing, the appropriateness of using healthy volunteers as opposed to affected patients in Phase I trials is rarely challenged.",
              "29 Subsequently, the pharmaceutical industry is advantaged by the broad support of these trials by regulatory bodies and many bioethicists as well as the pool of serial participants eager to enroll in their next study.",
              "Although not all harms are equally concerning, critical assessments of Phase I trials must not fall into the trap of minimizing, denying, or re-attributing the harms that routinely occur.",

              "During the development of oncology drugs, clinical pharmacology studies in HVs have been used to assess pharmacokinetics, drug metabolism, food effects, potential drug\u2013drug interactions, effects of hepatic and renal impairment, and other pharmacologic parameters vital for clinical decision-making in oncology.",

              "Clinical drug development is divided into 4 phases.",

              "Phase 2 studies are designed to establish the clinical effectiveness of a novel drug candidate in a small patient population at a therapeutic dose [1, 2].",
              "Phase 3 studies are usually large, randomized, controlled trials designed to establish the benefit-risk profile of a novel drug candidate at the recommended dose and schedule and to support regulatory approval [1, 2].",
              "Finally, Phase 4 studies are post-approval studies designed to further define the safety and effectiveness of an approved drug in a real-world setting [1, 2].",
              "With the exception of genotoxic oncology drugs, first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1 clinical studies for a wide range of investigational drugs have traditionally been conducted in healthy volunteers (HVs), defined by the National Institutes of Health as \u201csomeone with no known significant health problems who participates in research to test a new drug, device, or intervention\u201d [4].",
              "The primary goal of HV studies is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a novel drug candidate, determine appropriate dosing, and document safety and tolerability [3].",
              "Phase 1 trials typically involve 20 to 80 HVs divided into small cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects who receive escalating doses of the investigational drug.",

              "define the PK profile;",

              "In the United States, approximately 70% of experimental drugs pass the first phase [5].",
              "The HV model is ideal for this type of early clinical research because it allows testing of the pharmacology and safety profile of a drug candidate without the influence of any pathological conditions.",
              "HV studies typically include both male and female subjects.",
              "However, historically, women were underrepresented in clinical trials, particularly in early trials, or excluded due to pregnancy risks [6,7,8].",
              "In the early 1990s, regulatory authorities requested the inclusion of women in drug development to thoroughly evaluate potential gender-related differences in the clinical pharmacology of new therapeutic agents [9].",
              "Since then, it has been recognized that women and men differ in how they absorb, metabolize and excrete certain therapeutic products.",
              "Several factors may contribute to these variations, including body composition, hormonal changes, plasma volume, gastric emptying time, plasma protein levels, and cytochrome P450 activity [10,11,12,13].",
              "Furthermore, evidence also suggests that the frequency of adverse events (AEs) reported may be higher in women than men, which could be due, at least in part, to potential hormonal effects on physiologic functions [14, 15].",
              "However, by enrolling both male and female subjects in clinical trials, gender-related differences, including drug responses relative to safety and efficacy, can be better identified to more carefully direct clinical decision-making.",

              "indeed, risk can be a major deciding factor among HVs [17].",
              "In efforts to investigate potential risks to HVs, a survey of clinicians from the British Pharmacological Society published in 1989 found that < 1% of > 8000 HVs involved in clinical studies over a 12-month period experienced moderately severe AEs, and 0.",
              "04% experienced potentially life-threatening AEs [18].",
              "More recently, in a systematic review of 475 HV studies to examine the risk of harm, Johnson and colleagues [19] concluded that Phase 1 HV trials pose a low risk of severe or serious harm to study subjects, reporting that AEs of moderate severity occurred at a rate of 46/1000 participants per monitoring day.",
              "Although the risks to HVs are generally considered to be acceptable, cases that highlight the potential risks have resulted in reforms to the European regulations for HV studies.",
              "One case involved an FIH study, conducted in London, United Kingdom in 2006, of an immunomodulatory drug called TGN1412, a novel super agonist anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody that directly stimulates T cells.",
              "Six subjects were dosed simultaneously at the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), but all 6 rapidly developed severe cytokine release syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive supportive care [20].",
              "Although there were no deaths in that case, a similar situation in Rennes, France in 2016 (BIA 10-2474 trial) did result in the death of one HV who received a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor and died 1 week after being hospitalized with neurologic symptoms [21].",
              "As a direct result of the first case, the European Medicines Agency published a guideline in 2007 to emphasize that absolute consideration should be given to characterizing risks and implementing appropriate strategies to mitigate the risks associated with FIH clinical studies [22].",
              "The 2007 guidelines were revised after the case in France [23, 24].",
              "These reforms emphasize that the safety of study subjects (whether patients or HVs) should always be the number one priority.",
              "The European Medicines Agency guideline recommends integrated protocols to ensure that relevant animal models are employed, the mechanism(s) of action and PD effects of a drug are well understood, and the starting dose for FIH studies is based on either the minimal anticipated biological effect level or the pharmacologically active dose, which is usually lower than the NOAEL [23].",
              "These important reforms along with a greater understanding and appreciation of the risks to human subjects should ensure that the advantages of HV studies are not overshadowed by unreasonable risks or ethical concerns.",
              "In this review, we will focus on the current and future role of HV studies in the development of investigational non-oncology and oncology drugs and examine the design of PK modeling FIH studies in HVs.",
              "Although the use of HVs in non-oncology Phase 1 clinical trials is relatively safe (defined as a low probability of risk based on preclinical toxicology data and selected starting doses with large safety margins), ethical challenges exist because of the potential risks to which participants are exposed.",
              "We present as examples the risks to HVs in studies of 2 classes of non-oncological drugs, namely proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, which lower cholesterol and prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, which lower serum glucose levels in patients with diabetes and have newly recognized cardiovascular benefits (Table 1).",
              "Inhibitors of PCSK9, a protease that leads to the destruction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) receptors, have been developed as adjuncts to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease requiring additional lowering of LDL-C [25].",
              "Two agents that target and inactivate PCSK9, evolocumab and alirocumab, have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
              "Both prevent the destruction of LDL-C receptors, thereby lowering LDL-C levels by 50% to 60%.",
              "Regarding inhibitors of PCSK9, monoclonal antibodies have proven to be the most effective [25].",
              "In 3 Phase 1 trials (2 single dose and 1 multiple dose) of alirocumab (REGN727) in 133 HVs, 2 subjects in the single-dose studies had serious adverse events (SAEs);",
              "no SAEs were reported in the multiple-dose study [26].",
              "The SAEs were abdominal pain and rectal bleeding in a subject who received placebo, and small bowel obstruction in a subject with an appendectomy history who received alirocumab.",
              "Evolocumab (AMG 145) was evaluated in 2 Phase 1, blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized (by dose) trials in HVs, and no SAEs were reported [27].",
              "SGLT-2 inhibitors lower glucose levels by blocking its reabsorption in renal tubules, thereby enhancing excretion of excess glucose [28].",
              "Currently, the FDA has approved 4 SGLT-2 inhibitors: canagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, and dapagliflozin.",
              "Canagliflozin and empagliflozin have been evaluated in completed large cardiovascular outcomes trials [29, 30].",
              "These drugs all have similar overall benefit-risk profiles, and they work to reduce HbA1c and fasting glucose levels while occasionally increasing the risk for certain infections.",
              "The frequency of AEs associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors has been comparable across the drug class, and risks to Phase 1 participants have remained extremely low at all doses [28].",
              "Ertugliflozin has been tested as part of the VERTIS clinical development program.",
              "In a Phase 1 controlled study, the effect of ertugliflozin on cardiac repolarization was examined in 42 HVs [31].",
              "The HVs experienced no clinically significant changes in their electrocardiogram parameters at a supratherapeutic dose (100 mg) of ertugliflozin, and most AEs were of mild severity.",
              "Later trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or stage 3A chronic kidney disease showed that ertugliflozin (5 and 15 mg) could reduce HbA1c levels in both type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 3A chronic kidney disease cohorts [32].",
              "Similar to that shown in these FIH studies of non-oncology drugs, a meta-analysis of Phase 1 trials conducted at Pfizer dedicated Phase 1 testing sites between 2004 and 2011 showed that in 11,028 HVs who received study drug, most AEs (85%) were mild and only 34 SAEs (0.",
              "31%) occurred, with none resulting in life-threatening complications or deaths.",
              "Approximately half of all AEs were related to the study drug or to study-related procedures [33].",
              "In another large analysis of Phase 1 trials published between 2008 and 2012, there was a median of zero SAEs and zero severe AEs [19].",
              "The authors concluded that, although recent non-oncological agents in Phase 1 trials may pose mild to moderate risks to HVs, there is a low likelihood of severe harm.",
              "In a systematic review of 355 HVs in the Bristol-Meyers Squibb database, which excluded oncology studies, there were no safety concerns regarding SAEs or deaths [34].",
              "These examples highlight the overall favorable safety profile observed in HV studies of investigational non-oncology drugs.",
              "Serious or severe AEs are rarely reported.",
              "However, as the case of BIA 10-2474 illustrates, there is the potential for non-oncology drugs to cause significant harm, particularly those with neurologic or cardiac effects.",
              "In this case, BIA 10-2474 was tested in 2 single-dose, dose-escalation studies at doses up to 100 mg with no safety concerns;",
              "however, in a subsequent Phase 1 study, 6 HVs who received multiple daily doses of 50 mg/day over 5 days developed severe neurologic side effects, and one subject went into a coma and died [35].",
              "This study revealed a possible threshold effect of BIA 10-2474 that was not anticipated based on the PK and safety data available at the time.",
              "BIA 10-2474 is an FAAH inhibitor that reduces catabolism of endocannabinoids, thereby increasing their concentration in the central nervous system.",
              "The endocannabinoids have been implicated in a variety of neurologic conditions such as chronic pain, depression, and anxiety disorders, and a variety of exogenous cannabinoids are approved for use but have some neurologic side effects, such as impaired cognition and motor functions.",
              "Administration of an FAAH inhibitor was thought to reduce the risk of those side effects, and several other members of this drug class have been tested clinically and are well tolerated.",
              "After intense investigation, it is believed that BIA 10-2474 has off-target effects on several lipases in the brain, which may affect how neurons metabolize lipids.",
              "This may have been the cause of the observed toxicity, but a definitive cause has yet to be determined [36].",
              "Nevertheless, this case highlights the potential risk any time a novel agent is tested in humans and emphasizes the importance of rigorous preclinical testing to fully characterize its activity.",
              "Furthermore, precise and appropriate safety parameters are necessary to properly screen HVs, to determine clinical trial eligibility criteria for a given therapeutic area, and to carefully monitor HVs during Phase 1 studies to inform dosing decisions.",
              "In oncology drug development, early clinical trials have typically not been done in HVs as the investigation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was traditionally only considered ethical in cancer patients [37].",
              "The use of HVs in studies of agents intended for cancer patients may seem paradoxical, yet the principles underlying HV oncology studies are the same as for all HV studies.",
              "The perception that it is inappropriate to expose HVs to molecules intended for use in cancer patients stems from the historical use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, with their attendant narrow therapeutic index and potential for lasting DNA damage.",
              "However, the emergence of molecularly targeted agents as effective cancer therapies has resulted in opportunities to characterize these molecules in HVs, providing a path forward for increased information gathering without the need for large numbers of cancer patients.",
              "Importantly, the use of HVs also allows the circumvention of the traditional ethical dilemma of treating advanced cancer patients with subtherapeutic doses of an investigational drug in order to obtain preliminary safety data.",
              "The reduced treatment-related toxicities shown with targeted therapies have led to the reassessment of the potential risks and benefits of HV studies [38].",
              "Following an analysis of Phase 1 clinical trials conducted from 1991 to 2002, which demonstrated a marked reduction in toxic deaths over the time period [39], the FDA issued a statement in favor of HV studies for non-cytotoxic anticancer drugs.",
              "Alongside preclinical (e.",
              "g. genotoxicity assessments) and clinical considerations (e.",
              "g. 1 to 2 doses at most), the FDA cited several reasons to conduct HV clinical trials, including \u201cexploration of bioavailability, reduction of patient exposure to relatively low/ineffective drug doses, and relatively rapid study accrual\u201d [40].",
              "An increase in the number of anticancer Phase 1 clinical trials enrolling HVs has since been observed in recent years [41].",
              "Select clinical trials of oncology drugs in HVs are shown in Table 2.",
              "Traditional oncology FIH trials use a modified version of the up-and-down method created in 1948 by Dixon and Mood [42].",
              "In the traditional 3 + 3 Phase 1 design, a minimum of 3 participants is studied at each dose level (Fig.",
              "2a).",
              "If none of the 3 participants experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the next group of 3 participants is enrolled into the subsequent highest dose level.",
              "If one of the 3 participants experiences a DLT, up to 3 additional participants are enrolled for a total of 6 participants.",
              "When DLTs are observed in at least 2 participants out of either 3 or 6 participants, the maximum administered dose is reached and additional participants are enrolled in the next lower dose level (the maximum tolerated dose).",
              "The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose level at which none or 1 of 6 participants (0% to 17%) experiences a DLT.",
              "In the 3 + 3 design, accrual is suspended after enrollment of each cohort of 3 participants and resumed when all 3 participants have cleared the DLT period.",
              "The dose is increased in each subsequent cohort using a modified Fibonacci sequence in whichever higher escalation steps have ever decreasing relative increments (e.",
              "g. dose increases of 100%, 65%, 50%, 40%, and 30% thereafter).",

              "DL dose level, DLT dose-limiting toxicity, G2 grade 2, MAD maximum administered dose, MTD maximum tolerated dose The traditional 3 + 3 design has many limitations, including long delays in accrual, replacement of nonevaluable patients, and limited characterization of PK given the small sample sizes.",
              "In addition, it can be difficult to determine whether an AE is related to the investigational drug or to a symptom of the underlying metastatic cancer.",
              "Moreover, due to the conservative nature of the dose-escalation scheme, many patients are exposed to subtherapeutic doses of the study drug, thus raising the ethical question of whether it is appropriate to knowingly expose patients with advanced cancer to ineffective doses of experimental therapies.",
              "Some investigators have thus modified the traditional design to enroll only 1 patient per cohort and conduct sequential 100% dose escalations until a drug-related grade 2 toxicity is observed, at which point the traditional 3 + 3 design and modified Fibonacci dose escalations commence.",
              "This has been termed the \u201caccelerated titration design\u201d (Fig.",
              "2b).",
              "Another modification, the \u201crolling six,\u201d has been proposed as a means of accelerating FIH cancer trials, albeit with a slight increase in the number of patients required [43].",
              "Conducting FIH trials of oncology drugs in HVs can address many of the issues raised with the 3 + 3 design or its variants.",
              "Accrual is generally very rapid with all subjects being enrolled on the same day, nonevaluable subjects are rare, and sample size can be increased with no increase in time to conduct the trial.",
              "Also, the relationship of AEs to study drug can generally be clearly ascertained due to the otherwise healthy nature of the study subjects.",
              "Perhaps most importantly, patients with advanced cancer are not exposed to subtherapeutic doses of experimental therapies.",
              "The main disadvantage of conducting FIH trials in HVs is an inability to assess the PD effects of the drug if the molecular target is unique to the cancer cell (e.",
              "g. a tumor-specific mutated protein).",
              "Furthermore, it is obviously not possible to examine antitumor activity in HVs.",
              "Two issues typically are considered when deciding whether it is appropriate to conduct an FIH study of an oncology drug in HVs: potential for genotoxicity and predicted starting dose.",
              "Genotoxicity is defined as the property of a chemical agent to damage DNA, potentially leading to carcinogenesis.",
              "HV studies require completion of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, whereas genotoxicity study requirements are generally waived for cytotoxic drugs, which are already known to be genotoxic.",
              "Thus, when considering whether to conduct studies in HVs, investigators will need to consider the time and cost to conduct genotoxicity studies and consider whether the specific mechanism of the investigational drug is likely to be genotoxic.",
              "The predicted starting dose also plays a crucial role in determining feasibility of an FIH HV study.",
              "As previously noted, the starting dose for an FIH HV study is generally 1/10 of the rodent NOAEL.",
              "In contrast, the starting dose for cytotoxic drugs is generally 1/10 of the rodent severely toxic dose.",
              "If the preclinical efficacious dose is equal to or less than the NOAEL and the mechanism of the drug is predicted to be non-genotoxic, a strong case can be made to conduct the FIH trial in HVs.",
              "If the preclinical efficacious dose far exceeds the NOAEL or approaches 1/10 of the severely toxic dose, it is still possible to conduct the FIH trial in HVs, albeit simply to characterize the PK of the molecule.",
              "It is important to note that the above considerations apply equally to small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, cell therapies, and other emerging modalities such as RNA therapeutics.",
              "Indeed, HV studies have been conducted, for example, with anti-colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) and anti-CSF1R antibodies [44].",
              "Although most studies in an oncology drug development program are designed to characterize the safety and efficacy of the molecule, an even greater number of studies are conducted to characterize the clinical pharmacology of the molecule.",
              "Clinical pharmacology studies for anticancer drugs have multiple objectives and designs that lend themselves to being conducted in HVs (Table 3), and they differ greatly from typical FIH studies conducted in cancer patients who have exhausted all lines of therapy in the era of cytotoxic chemotherapy [39].",
              "In fact, HVs may be a better population for assessing the PK of a novel drug candidate because performance status can contribute to differences in PK parameters.",
              "Although representative patient populations are essential for appropriate dose selection, much can be learned from clinical pharmacology studies conducted in HVs.",
              "Such studies typically utilize small cohorts, with appropriate controls, to provide specific information about PK, drug metabolism, food effects, potential drug\u2013drug interactions, effects of hepatic and renal impairment, and other pharmacologic parameters vital for clinical decision making.",
              "Studies in HVs are also being used to demonstrate the similarity of biosimilars to established anticancer biologic agents.",
              "Clinical pharmacology studies employ a wide range of designs.",
              "For example, the crossover study design is widely used to compare different formulations of a drug.",
              "A reference formulation is initially given to the subject, followed by a washout period and the administration of an investigational formulation.",
              "Crossover studies reduce the required number of subjects and limit potential sources of variation or confounding [45].",
              "Deviations from crossover studies include matched control studies and randomized controlled studies, and these are justified on the basis of a particular study objective and/or the level of evidence required.",
              "Complete characterization of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination can also be accomplished by administering a radiolabeled drug to HVs (n < 10) in a biospecimen collection-focused mass balance study design [23, 46,47,48].",
              "Determination of bioequivalence is an industry standard approach to quantify whether the maximum concentration, time to maximum concentration, and area under the concentration\u2013time curve (AUCt and AUC0\u2212\u221e) of a new drug formulation is within the 80% to 125% range of the 90% confidence interval of a reference formulation (historical data or data collected on study), which is required to demonstrate that the formulations are bioequivalent [49].",

              "In recent investigations of abiraterone acetate, a CYP17 inhibitor approved for metastatic prostate cancer, HV studies have been used to investigate bioequivalence to a reference formulation with smaller doses via exploitation of food effect or optimized formulations [55,56,57].",
              "Other recent HV studies, specifically studies investigating bevacizumab formulations [58,59,60,61], have incorporated blinded, randomized, single-dose, parallel group designs with at least 30 subjects per group.",

              "The effects of hepatic and renal impairment on clearance and AUC have also been assessed in studies of HVs.",
              "However, because a crossover design is not feasible for these studies, subjects with the specified organ impairment are usually matched with healthy controls to generate the appropriate comparisons [67,68,69].",

              "However, HV studies investigating dose-dependent toxicity and biomarker-driven PD effects usually do not provide sufficient evidence of safety or efficacy, and additional studies in cancer patients are often needed to fully characterize the profile of the drug.",

              "Differences in PK parameters between HVs and cancer patients should be assumed and then tested as a covariate in model development unless proven otherwise.",
              "For example, a recent population PK analysis of cabozantinib demonstrated that patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma had an approximate 93% increase in clearance relative to HVs, leading to 40% to 50% lower predicted steady-state plasma concentrations [77].",

              "As a result, phase II trials often utilize surrogate markers (in place of or in addition to clinical endpoints) in a homogeneous sample to maximize the signal to noise ratio and consequently increase power (13,16).",

              "Therefore, significance does not necessarily mean validity of results.",
              "Accordingly, the investigator must assess two important components when designing a trial: One way to see the importance of this problem is by analyzing the attrition rate from early to late phases.",
              "Attrition means the drop in the number of drugs that make it to market compared to those studied in preclinical and clinical trials.",
              "Most drugs studied (about 90%) never make it to market, as human trials do not show efficacy (27\u201329).",

              "This understanding for instance led to the design of a trial on tDCS in PLP including follow-ups months after treatment was completed (25), because tDCS mechanisms of action putatively lead to neuroplastic changes lasting several months (43).",
              "Lacking mechanistic data leads to an increased risk of unexpected results even if the trial design eliminated all or most sources of bias.",

              "Dose-finding trials\u2014studies conducted to identify the most promising doses or doses to use in later studies\u2014are a key part of the second phase and are intended to answer the dual questions of whether future development is warranted and what dose or doses should be used.",
              "If too high a dose is chosen, adverse effects in later confirmatory phase 3 trials may threaten the development program.",
              "If too low a dose is chosen, the treatment effect may be too small to yield a positive confirmatory trial and gain approval from a regulatory agency.",
              "A well-designed dose-finding trial is able to establish the optimal dose of a medication and facilitate the decision to proceed with a phase 3 trial.",
              "Selection of a dose for further testing requires an understanding of the relationships between dose and both efficacy and safety.",
              "These relationships can be assessed by comparing the data from each dose group with placebo, or with the other doses, in a series of pairwise comparisons.",
              "This approach is prone to both false-negative and false-positive results because of the large number of statistical comparisons and the relatively small number of patients receiving each dose.",
              "These risks can be mitigated by combining data from patients receiving multiple active doses into a single treatment group for comparison with placebo (\u201cpooling\u201d), but only if it is possible to reliably predict which doses are likely to be effective.",
              "In general, dose-response relationships are best examined through dose-response models that make flexible, justifiable assumptions about the potential dose-response relationships and allow the integration of information from all doses used in the trial.",

              "incorporating all data into the estimates of efficacy and safety for each dose produces more accurate estimates than evaluating the response to each dose separately.",
              "In this issue of JAMA, Gheorghiade et al1 report the results of SOCRATES-REDUCED, a randomized placebo-controlled dose-finding clinical trial investigating 4 different target doses of vericiguat for patients with worsening chronic heart failure, with the primary outcome being a reduction in log-transformed level of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.",
              "The primary approach to analyzing the dose response, combining the data from patients allocated to the 3 highest target doses (pooling) for comparison with placebo, yielded a negative result (P = .",
              "15), but a different dose-response model based on linear regression, used in an exploratory secondary analysis, yielded a positive result (P = .",
              "02).",
              "A dose-response model assumes a general relationship between dose and efficacy or dose and the rates of adverse effects.",
              "2 Ideally, this allows data from patients receiving all doses of the drug to contribute to the estimated dose-response curve, maximizing the statistical power of the study and reducing the uncertainty in the estimates of the effects of each dose.",
              "When a sufficiently flexible general relationship is used, the dose-response model correctly identifies doses of low or high efficacy (avoiding the assumption of similar efficacy across doses, as is implied with pooling) while smoothing out spurious highs and lows (avoiding problems that occur when each dose is analyzed separately).",
              "A model can produce estimates and confidence intervals for the effect of every dose and often even for drug doses not included in the trial.",
              "Dose-response modeling is first used to determine whether a treatment effect appears to exist and, if so, to estimate dose-specific effects to help optimize subsequent phase 3 trial design.",
              "Unlike a confirmatory trial in which a regulatory agency makes a binary decision (eg, to approve or not approve a drug), phase 2 trials are used to inform the next stage of drug development.",
              "Therefore, estimation of the magnitude of treatment effects is more important than testing hypotheses regarding treatment effects.",
              "Phase 2 dose-finding studies can also be used to predict the likelihood of later phase 3 success through calculation of predictive probabilities.",
              "3 The assumptions in the dose-response model can be rigid or flexible to match preexisting knowledge of the clinical setting.",
              "When accurate, such assumptions can increase the power of a trial design by incorporating known clinical information.",
              "When inaccurate, these assumptions compromise the statistical properties of the trial and the interpretability of the results.",
              "For example, in SOCRATES-REDUCED, the primary analysis consisted of pooling data from the 3 highest-dose regimens.",
              "1 This approach is most effective when the efficacious region of the dose range can be predicted reliably.",
              "The exploratory secondary analysis in SOCRATES-REDUCED was based on a linear regression model.",
              "This approach is most effective when a linear dose-response relationship is likely to exist over the range of doses evaluated in the trial.",
              "A common dose-response model is the Emax model,4 which assumes an S-shaped curve for the dose response (eg, a monotonically increasing curve that is flat for low doses, increases for the middle dose range, and then flattens out again for high doses).",
              "The model is flexible in that the height of the plateau, the dose location of the increase in efficacy, and the rate of increase may all be informed by the data.",
              "Alternatives to the Emax model include smoothing models such as a normal dynamic linear model.",
              "5 These models take the raw data and produce a smooth curve that eliminates random highs and lows but maintains the general shape.",
              "Normal dynamic linear models are particularly useful for dose responses that may be \u201cinverted U\u201d shaped and may be applicable when the dose response is for an outcome that combines safety and efficacy (low doses may not be efficacious, high doses may be unsafe, resulting in an inverted U shape, with the optimal dose in the middle).",
              "All dose-response models require assumptions regarding the potential shapes of the dose-response curve, although sometimes (eg, with pooling) the assumptions are only implied.",
              "When assumptions are incorrect, inferences from the model may be invalid.",
              "In SOCRATES-REDUCED, the implied assumption of the primary analysis of similar efficacy among the 3 highest doses was not supported by the data.",
              "Similarly, the linear model used in the exploratory secondary analysis assumed that the increase in benefit from one dose to the next was the same between every successive pair of doses.",
              "This also does not appear to be strictly consistent with the data obtained in the trial.",
              "The authors used dose-response modeling to maximize the power of the primary analysis hypothesis test.",
              "If the 3 highest doses had all been similarly effective, pooling of data from these doses would result in higher sample sizes in the treatment group of the primary \u201ctreatment vs placebo\u201d hypothesis test and higher power to detect an effect.",
              "In the exploratory secondary analysis using the linear dose-response model, the authors used a model that allowed the higher doses to be significantly more efficacious than the lower doses.",
              "Figure 2 in the report by Gheorghiade et al1 shows the key dose-response relationship and suggests that the 10-mg target dose is the most or possibly only effective dose.",

              "The primary analysis did not evaluate the effect of the 10-mg dose alone, and separate analyses for each dose would be prone to high variation and false-positive results due to multiple comparisons.",

              "This analysis and its results were considered only exploratory.",

              "If the medication acts differently than expected, the investigators will likely to do some additional preclinical research before deciding whether to continue the trial.",
              "During phase I of a clinical trial, investigators spend several months looking at the effects of the medication on about 20 to 80 people who have no underlying health conditions.",
              "This phase aims to figure out the highest dose humans can take without serious side effects.",
              "Investigators monitor participants very closely to see how their bodies react to the medication during this phase.",
              "While preclinical research usually provides some general information about dosing, the effects of a medication on the human body can be unpredictable.",
              "In addition to evaluating safety and ideal dosage, investigators also look at the best way to administer the drug, such as orally, intravenously, or topically.",

              "The FDA estimates that about 33 percent of medications move on to phase III.",

              "Trials in this phase can last for several years.",
              "The purpose of phase III is to evaluate how the new medication works in comparison to existing medications for the same condition.",
              "To move forward with the trial, investigators need to demonstrate that the medication is at least as safe and effective as existing treatment options.",
              "To do this, investigators use a process called randomization.",
              "This involves randomly choosing some participants to receive the new medication and others to receive an existing medication.",
              "Phase III trials are usually double-blind, which means that neither the participant nor the investigator knows which medication the participant is taking.",
              "This helps to eliminate bias when interpreting results.",
              "The FDA usually requires a phase III clinical trial before approving a new medication.",

              "If investigators demonstrate that the medication is at least as safe and effective as others already on the market, the FDA will usually approve the medication.",
