    "response": "That's a very interesting and broad question. The cultures and cuisines of South Korea and Japan have some similarities and differences, and they have also influenced each other over time in various ways.\n\nSome of the similarities between the two countries are:\n\n- They both use chopsticks as utensils and eat rice and soup as staple foods[^2^].\n- They both have a long history of Buddhism and Confucianism as major religions and philosophies[^6^].\n- They both have a strong sense of national identity and pride, especially after recovering from the devastation of World War II and the Korean War[^1^].\n\nSome of the differences between the two countries are:\n\n- South Korea has a more spicy and diverse cuisine than Japan, which tends to be more mild and simple. South Korea also uses more chili pepper, garlic, sesame oil and soy sauce, while Japan uses more fish sauce, peanut oil, sake and sweet sauces[^4^] [^5^].\n- Japan has a more homogeneous and isolated society than South Korea, which has been more influenced by China, Mongolia, Russia and the United States. Japan also has a more hierarchical and formal culture than South Korea, which is more egalitarian and informal[^3^].\n- South Korea has a more democratic and liberal political system than Japan, which is more conservative and nationalist. South Korea also has a more dynamic and innovative economy than Japan, which is more stable and mature[^1^].\n\nThe two countries have also influenced each other over time in various ways, such as:\n\n- Japan colonized Korea from 1910 to 1945, during which it tried to assimilate Koreans into the Japanese empire by changing their laws, policies, education, language, religion and culture. This caused a lot of resentment and resistance among Koreans, who tried to preserve their identity and history[^1^] [^6^].\n- After the liberation from Japan in 1945, Korea was divided into North and South by the Soviet Union and the United States. The Korean War (1950-1953) broke out between the two sides, with China supporting the North and the United Nations (mainly the US) supporting the South. Japan was not directly involved in the war, but it provided logistical support to the UN forces and benefited from the economic recovery after the war[^1^].\n- In the late 20th century, both countries experienced rapid economic growth and became global leaders in technology, industry and culture. They also developed closer diplomatic and trade relations with each other, despite some historical disputes and territorial issues. They also exchanged cultural influences through popular media, such as music, movies, anime, manga, games and fashion[^3^].",

              "It might even be described as a sort of cryptic \u201cChristo-Confucianology\u201d, whereby Christian motifs inform his discourse on morality, which is guided by an anthropomorphic Sangje (discussed in detail in Cawley 2014b).",
              "In Chungyong kangu\u0306ibo (\u4e2d\u5eb8\u8b1b\u7fa9\u88dc) [Supplement to Lectures on the Doctrine of the Mean], Tasan (Kugyo\u0306k yo\u0306yudang cho\u0306nso\u0306: vol.",

              "In another text, Maengja you\u0306i (\u5b5f\u5b50\u8981\u7fa9) [The Essentials of The Mencius] Tasan notes that the circle in this diagram which represents the Supreme Ultimate does not appear anywhere in the [Five] Classics.",
              "(Maengja you\u0306i: 383) Tasan, similar to Matteo Ricci, reorients his ideas away from these widely accepted Neo-Confucian metaphysical norms towards an all-seeing Sangje to provide an alternative foundation for his moral framework.",
              "It is Sangje who re-stabilises Tasan\u2019s re-conceptualised ontotheological-cosmology, disentangling it from Principle, the Supreme Ultimate, yin and yang, as well as the five elements.",

              "\u201d, answering that Sangje is a being that creates, governs and maintains heaven, earth, spirits, humans and all things, but also transcends them.",
              "(Ch\u2019unch\u2019u kojing, a283_363a) Furthermore, this quote echoes the full title of Ricci\u2019s first chapter in the True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven: A Discussion on the creation of Heaven, Earth, and all things by the Lord of Heaven and on the way he governs and sustains them.",
              "(Ricci 1985:65) Earlier scholars such as Yun Hyu (1617\u20131680) and Pak Sedang (1629\u20131703) had dared to be critical of Zhu Xi\u2019s interpretations of texts and rituals, but Mark Setton (1997: 102\u2013103) notes how Tasan took this to another level, arguing that even his conception of Confucian virtue was \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d to Zhu Xi\u2019s.",
              "Setton also notes how Tasan even rejected the introspective aspects of self-cultivation, advocating an outward ethical practice based on our moral priorities.",
              "This then is contingent upon free will, a radical idea in Tasan\u2019s work, where good and evil are not aspects of one\u2019s material force, but rather, related to the psychological level, and only exist \u201cin the context of concrete human relations\u201d (Setton 1989: 380).",
              "Free will is then the defining feature of the human being because This ability to make moral choices, and consequently to shape his own moral destiny, places man in an entirely different category from the animals.",
              "(1989: 380) This also shapes Tasan\u2019s other writings that highlight his profound interest in reforming his society: Kyo\u0306ngse yup\u2019yo (\u7d93\u4e16\u907a\u8868) [Design for Good Government], Mongmin simso\u030c (\u7267\u6c11\u5fc3\u66f8) [Admonitions on Governing the People], and Hu\u0306mhu\u0306m sinso\u030c (\u6b3d\u6b3d\u65b0\u66f8) [Toward a New Jurisprudence].",
              "These three texts are generally considered to embody Tasan\u2019s practical Sirhak ideology, though they too draw on commentaries and examples from Confucian literature.",
              "However, Tasan\u2019s writings do not necessarily eulogise Confucianism and its laws, rather, we often find a harsh critique of it, which moves away from metaphysical debates to deal with the actual matters at hand\u2014a society in decay, and poor people suffering from harsh punishments and taxes (see B.",

              "The nineteenth century was a time of transformation in East Asia, particularly in Korea, and Confucian scholars were still eager to validate their discourse, even if it meant persecuting rivals: between 1866 and 1871, between 8,000 and 10,000 Catholics, men, women and children were tortured and executed by Confucian authorities.",
              "Choi Min-Hong (1980:191\u2013217) notes the re-emergence of philosophers interested in Principle in the nineteenth century, many who had been linked with the Namin faction, hence, proponents of the T\u2019oegye\u2019s metaphysical ideas.",
              "This included Ki Cho\u0306ngjin (1798\u20131876) and Yi Hangno (1792\u20131868), the latter who considered Principle to be the basic substance of the universe, and \u201csomething spiritual\u201d (1980: 194).",

              "Park Chong-hong (2004: 396) critiques the trend of the (later-called) Sirhak [Practical] scholars, who \u201cmade the mistake of arranging encyclopedic knowledge\u201d and other \u201ctrivial matters\u201d, clearly unable to fathom what was coming, and unable to provide Choso\u0306n with the tools it needed to survive the \u201cmodernisation\u201d that would soon be thrust upon the peninsula, leading to Japan\u2019s eventual colonial rule over the peninsula (1910\u20131945).",
              "As the situation on the peninsula disintegrated, Koreans sought alternatives to Confucianism to deal with social issues and inequality.",
              "The first of these New Religious Movements (NRMs) was known as Tonghak (\u6771\u5b78), or Eastern Learning, to contrast directly with the foreign \u201cWestern Learning\u201d, and it attempted to help hopeless poor peasants whose lives were getting progressively worse, especially in the southern regions far from the capital.",
              "Tonghak was founded by Ch\u2019oe Che-u (1824\u20131864), known by his followers as Su-un, and while providing an alternative to Confucianism, it used the name of the \u201cSovereign on High\u201d (Sangje) from the Confucian Classics to refer to its deity, while also using the Catholic term \u201cLord of Heaven\u201d (Ch\u2019o\u0306nju) as well.",
              "There were splinter groups formed out of this NRM such as Chu\u0306ngsando (more commonly written Jeungsando), and Daesoon Jinrihoe, both worshipping different iterations of Sangje\u2014a monotheistic Korean deity with Confucian origins (see Cawley 2019: ch.",
              "5).",
              "As the end of the Choso\u0306n dynasty drew nearer, and Korea opened up to Western countries, many Protestant missionaries would enter Korea by the late 1880s to make their mark on its religious culture.",
              "This motivated some Confucian scholars to attempt to revitalise Confucianism, emphasising its religious aspects, while others sought to reform Confucianism to counter the attempts by the Japanese government to \u201cJapanize\u201d the peninsula.",
              "Interestingly, Keum (1980 [2000: 219]) comments that \u201cIt goes without saying that the idea of Confucian Religion was prompted by the Christian concept of a transcendent God\u201d, as well as the idea of \u201cthe organisation of a religious community [and] their own religious institutions\u201d.",
              "However, this did not really take off, likely due to the elitism associated with Confucianism, and the way it had been responsible for the unfair treatment of people from different classes, and in particular, women, who were increasingly embracing Protestantism, which had facilitated their education in \u201cmodern\u201d schools.",
              "Han Hyong-jo (2016) articulates that more recent understandings of Korean Confucianism \u201chas mirrored its chief nemesis, modernity\u201d and outlines three stages: Indeed, rulers\u2019 challengers were easily disposed of\u2014even if they should be senior members of their own family\u2014contravening teachings on filial piety.",
              "Confucianism has also been linked with a resurgence of \u201cAsian\u201d values, or recalibrated (yet again) to permit a feminist turn, and possibly even found in some of the Juche ideas of North Korea\u2019s state ideology, which commands undisputed loyalty (chung) to its Dear Leader.",
              "Confucianism is currently at a crossroads as it interacts with other traditions in the twenty-first century, nestling between them and insinuating itself throughout them (Min 2016).",
              "In a sense, one might look to recovering what Han Hyoung-jo (2016) describes as a lost art of Confucian ihak, a form of cultivation of the mind, whereby reengaging with it might just draw us closer to how it was understood for centuries, and bring us closer to its goal, which is not democracy, but something more noble, sagehood.",
              "Han (2016) suggests that this has the potential to cure us from \u201cself-oblivion and self-centredness\u201d, the deficiencies and flaws of our culture today, by helping us to rediscover our innate potential for humane co-existence, irrespective of our political or religious views.",
              "Korean Confucianism and its emphasis on sage learning, rather than being outmoded, may be the agnostic moral approach that has the potential to reconnect us to ourselves and each other, at a time when psychological distress is on the rise in all modern \u201cdeveloped\u201d democracies.",

              "Buddhism arrived first in the northern kingdom of Koguryo\u0306 and then gradually spread into the other two kingdoms. As often happened, the new faith was first accepted by the court and then extended to the people.",
              "After the unification of the country by the kingdom of Silla in the 660s, Buddhism flourished throughout Korea.",
              "The growth of Buddhism in Korea was facilitated by a number of impressive scholars and reformers, including the monk Wonhyo\u0306 Daisa (617\u2013686).",
              "He was married and taught an ecumenical version of Buddhism that included all branches and sects.",
              "He tried to use music, literature, and dance to express the meaning of Buddhism.",
              "Another important scholar of the Silla era was U\u0306isang (625\u2013702), who went to China and returned to spread the Hwaom (Huayan in Chinese) sect in Korea.",
              "The Chinese Chan sect (Zen, called So\u0306n in Korea) was introduced in the 8th century and, by absorbing the Korean versions of Huayan, Tientai, and Pure Land, gradually became the dominant school of Buddhism in Korea, as it did in Vietnam.",
              "Early Korean Buddhism was characterized by a worldly attitude.",
              "It emphasized the pragmatic, nationalistic, and aristocratic aspects of the faith.",
              "Still, an indigenous tradition of shamanism influenced the development of popular Buddhism throughout the centuries.",
              "Buddhist monks danced, sang, and performed the rituals of shamans.",

              "Although the Choso\u0306n dynasty (1392\u20131910) continued these restrictions, Buddhist monks and laypersons fought bravely against invading Japanese armies under Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537\u201398) in 1592 and again in 1597.",
              "In the decade before the annexation of Korea by Japan (1910), some effort was made to unify Korean Buddhism.",
              "This effort, as well as subsequent efforts by Buddhist missionaries from Japan, was largely in vain.",
              "Since the end of World War II, Buddhism in Korea has been hampered by communist rule in the north and by the great vitality of Christianity in the south.",
              "Despite these challenges, Buddhists, particularly in South Korea, have preserved the old traditions and initiated new movements.",
              "While Buddhism in China sent its roots down into the subsoil of the family system, in Japan it found anchorage in the nation itself.",
              "Buddhism, when it was initially introduced into Japan from Korea in the 6th century, was regarded as a talisman (charm) for the protection of the country.",
              "The new religion was accepted by the powerful Soga clan but was rejected by others, and this resulted in controversies that were similar to those that accompanied the introduction of Buddhism into Tibet.",
              "In both countries some believed that the introduction of Buddhist statues had been an insult to the native deities and had thus been the cause of plagues and natural disasters.",
              "Only gradually were such feelings overcome.",
              "Although the Buddhism of the Soga clan was largely magical, Prince Sho\u0304toku\u2014who became regent of the nation in 593\u2014brought other aspects of Buddhism to the fore.",
              "Sho\u0304toku lectured on various scriptures that emphasized the ideals of the layperson and monarch, and he composed a \u201cSeventeen-Article Constitution\u201d in which Buddhism was adroitly mixed with Confucianism as the spiritual foundation of the state.",

              "Mount Hiei and Mount Ko\u0304ya became the centres for the new Tiantai (Tendai) and Vajrayana (Shingon) schools of Buddhism, which were characterized by highly sophisticated philosophies and complex and refined liturgies.",
              "Moreover, Buddhism interacted with the indigenous Shinto\u0304 and local tradition, and various distinctively Japanese patterns of Buddhist-oriented folk religion became very popular.",
              "The 12th and 13th centuries marked a turning point in Japanese history and in the history of Japanese Buddhism.",
              "Late in the 12th century the imperial regime centred at Heian collapsed, and a new hereditary military dictatorship, the shogunate, established its headquarters at Kamakura.",

              "Temples were used for registering the populace, and this inhibited the spread of Christianity, which the shogunate regarded as a political menace.",
              "By the beginning of the Meiji period (1868\u20131912), this association with the Tokugawa regime had made Buddhism quite unpopular.",
              "At that time, in order to set up Shinto\u0304 as the state religion, Japan\u2019s new ruling oligarchy decided to separate Shinto\u0304 from Buddhism.",

              "Koreans must thus strive to find ways to use ethnic nationalism constructively and mitigate its potential harmful effects.",
              "In particular, Koreans must seriously consider the establishment of a democratic institution that can contain the repressive, essentialist elements of nationalism.",
              "The principle of bloodline or \"jus sanguinis\" still defines the notion of Korean nationhood and citizenship, which are often inseparable in the mind of Koreans.",
              "In its formative years Koreans developed the ethnic base of nation without a corresponding attention to the political notion of citizenship.",

              "It is also much easier for a Korean-American who supposedly has \"Korean blood\" to \"recover\" Korean citizenship than for an Indonesian migrant worker living in Korea to obtain Korean citizenship.",
              "This is true even if the Indonesian worker might be more culturally and linguistically Korean than a Korean-American.",
              "Korea needs to institutionalize a legal system that mitigates unfair practices and discrimination against those who do not supposedly share the Korean blood.",
              "Koreans need an institutional framework to promote a democratic national identity that would allow for more diversity and tolerance among the populace, rather than simply appeal to an ethnic consciousness that tends to encourage false uniformity and enforce conformity to it.",
              "They should envision a society in which they can live together, not simply as fellow ethnic Koreans but as equal citizens of a democratic polity.",
              "It should be an integral part of democratic consolidation processes that Korea is currently undergoing.",
              "Otherwise, it would be hard to expect Korea to become \"Asia's hub,\" which will require the accommodation of cultural and ethnic diversity and flexibility.",
              "Discussion of unification is premature and can even be considered dangerous if unification occurs without such change.",
              "As the German unification experience shows, a shared ethnic identity alone will not be able to prevent North Koreans from becoming \"second-class citizens\" in a unified Korea.",
              "Even worse, because of higher expectations resulting from a shared sense of ethnic unity, a gap between identity (ethnic homogeneity) and practice (second-class citizens) will add more confusion and tension to the unification process.",
              "Thus, it will be a major challenge for Koreans to develop democratic institutions that can treat people living in Korea as equal citizens of a democratic polity.",
              "This task will be all the more important and urgent as Korea becomes more democratic, globalizes, and also prepares for national unification.",

But at least three of the 15 forced labor victims who have pending legal cases against Japanese companies have refused to accept any money that does not come from these companies directly.",

              "As historian Heejung Kang notes, the imperial government also attempted to preserve treasures of Korean art history and culture\u2014but then used them to uphold imperial Japan\u2019s image of itself as a civilizing and modern force.",
              "This view of Korea as backward and primitive compared to Japan made it into textbooks, museums and even Koreans\u2019 own perceptions of themselves.",
              "The occupation government also worked to assimilate Koreans with the help of language, religion and education.",
              "Shinto shrines originally intended for Japanese families became places of forced worship.",
              "The colonial government made Koreans \u201cworship the gods of imperial Japan, including dead emperors and the spirits of war heroes who had helped them conquer Korea earlier in the century,\u201d explains historian Donald N.",
              "Clark.",
              "This forced worship was viewed as an act of cultural genocide by many Koreans, but for the colonists, it was seen as evidence that Koreans and Japanese were a single, unified people.",
              "Though some families got around the Shinto edict by simply visiting the shrines and not praying there, others grudgingly adopted the new religious practices out of fear.",
              "By the end of its occupation of Korea, Japan had even waged war on people\u2019s family names.",
              "At first, the colonial government made it illegal for people to adopt Japanese-style names, ostensibly to prevent confusion in family registries.",
              "But in 1939, the government made changing names an official policy.",
              "Under the law, Korean families were \u201cgraciously allowed\u201d to choose Japanese surnames.",
              "At least 84 percent of all Koreans took on the names since people who lacked Japanese names were not recognized by the colonial bureaucracy and were shut out of everything from mail delivery to ration cards.",
              "\u201cThe whole point was for the government to be able to say that the people had changed their names \u2018voluntarily\u2019,\u201d writes historian Hildi Kang.",
              "Though Japan occupied Korea for an entire generation, the Korean people didn\u2019t submit passively to Japanese rule.",
              "Throughout the occupation, protest movements pushed for Korean independence.",
              "In 1919, the March First Movement proclaimed Korean independence and more than 1,500 demonstrations broke out.",
              "The protests were brutally suppressed by the Japanese, but not before the desire for independence swept through Korea.",
              "Later, underground groups like the Party of Three Thousand, a group of students that tried to undermine the Japanese military after being conscripted to fight in World War II, were formed.",

              "Some refused to speak Japanese or change their names;",
              "others came up with names that reflected their family history or contained subtle resistance to the policy.",
              "World War II devastated not just Japan, but the Korean Peninsula, and in 1945, the United States and the USSR captured the peninsula and ended Japanese rule there.",
              "Korea was divided into two occupation zones that were intended to be temporary.",
              "However, a unified state was never given back to the newly independent Korean people.",
              "Instead, the Korean War broke out between the Soviet and Chinese-backed northern half of Korea and the United States and United Nations-backed south.",
              "After the Korean War, South Korea transformed into a liberal democracy and tried to purge itself of the remnants of Japanese rule.",
              "The country prosecuted a small number of colonial collaborators immediately after World War II, and some of their land was confiscated.",
              "Today, disputes continue about how and whether to prosecute those who worked with the Japanese government during the occupation.",
              "While South Korea still grapples with the fallout of Japan\u2019s brutal occupation, it hasn\u2019t forgotten its resistance.",
              "Today, March 1\u2014the day of the independence protest in 1919\u2014is a national holiday in South Korea, a reminder not just of the resilience of the Korean people, but of the years of occupation they withstood.",

              "[11] One reason for this delay was Kim Won-bong's interference, as he naturally viewed the KLA as competition, especially because the Volunteers Army was subordinate to the Kuomintang and the KLA was more politically aligned with the Kuomintang.",
              "Another reason was concern about international pushback, particularly from the United States and the Soviet Union, by approving the KLA.",

              "[11][6] Especially after the December 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor, many in the US government were actually open to supporting Korean independence, but were cautious because of how it could impact the Pacific War, how it could cause other independence movements to demand US support, and because of the internal political division amongst Koreans.",
              "[12] Also, around December 1941, the KPG declared war on Japan.",
              "[6] On 10 April 1942, the Kuomintang informed the US that it wished to solely recognize the KPG, and asked if the US would too.",

              "[12] On 13 May, the KPG relented and approved the merger.",

              "[13][14][15] Kim Won-bong's relationship to the KPG would continue to be strained, even as he was elected as head of the Armed Forces on 11 April 1944.",
              "This position was notably weakened, and he would continue to be excluded in other ways.",
              "In an effort to gain greater control over the KLA, the Kuomintang quickly began reducing funding and placing numerous Chinese officers in vacant KLA administration positions.",
              "This effectively made any significant military activities impossible.",
