    "query": "What scientific advancements have been made in the field of renewable energy in the past decade, and how have they impacted the global effort to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Renewable energy has been growing rapidly in the past decade, thanks to technological innovations, cost reductions, and policy support. According to a McKinsey article[^2^], renewable energy\u2014led by wind and solar\u2014is poised to become the backbone of the world\u2019s power supply, generating 60% of the world\u2019s electricity by 2035. Some of the scientific advancements that have enabled this growth include:\n\n- Improved efficiency and reliability of wind turbines and solar panels, as well as better integration with the power grid and storage systems.\n- Development of offshore wind farms that can harness stronger and more consistent winds over the ocean.\n- Expansion of bioenergy, geothermal, and hydropower resources that can provide baseload and flexible power.\n- Innovation in green hydrogen production and utilization, which can offer a zero-emission fuel source for various sectors.\n\nThese advancements have contributed to the global effort to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change by displacing fossil fuels, enhancing energy security and diversity, and creating new jobs and industries. However, there are still many challenges and opportunities ahead, such as scaling up renewable energy deployment, addressing environmental and social impacts, and ensuring a just and equitable transition for all stakeholders. I hope this answer was helpful.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "With that in mind, McKinsey took a hard look at the data, modeling energy demand from the bottom up, by country, sector, and fuel mix, with an analysis of current conditions, historical data, and country-level assessments.",
              "On this basis, McKinseya\u0302\u0080\u0099s Global Energy Insights team has put together a description of the global energy landscape to 2050.",
              "It is important to remember that this is a business-as-usual scenario.",
              "That is, it does not anticipate big disruptions in either the production or use of energy.",
              "And, of course, predicting the future of anything is perilous.",
              "With those caveats in mind, here are four of the most interesting insights from this research.",
              "Global energy demand will continue to grow.",
              "But growth will be slowera\u0302\u0080\u0094an average of about 0.",
              "7 percent a year through 2050 (versus an average of more than 2 percent from 2000 to 2015).",
              "The decline in the rate of growth is due to digitization, slower population and economic growth, greater efficiency, a decline in European and North American demand, and the global economic shift toward services, which use less energy than the production of goods.",
              "For example, in India, the percentage of GDP derived from services is expected to rise from 54 to 64 percent by 2035.",
              "And efficiency is a forthright good-news story.",
              "By 2035, McKinsey research expects that it will take almost 40 percent less fuel to propel a fossil-fueled car a mile than it does now.",

              "That may sound optimistic, but it is based on recent history.",
              "From 1990 to 2015, global energy intensity improved by almost a third, and it is reasonable to expect the rate of progress to accelerate.",
              "Demand for electricity will grow twice as fast as that for transport.",
              "China and India will account for 71 percent of new capacity.",
              "By 2050, electricity will account for a quarter of all energy demand, compared with 18 percent now.",
              "How will that additional power be generated?",
              "More than three-quarters of new capacity (77 percent), according to the McKinsey research, will come from wind and solar, 13 percent from natural gas, and the rest from everything else.",
              "The share of nuclear and hydro is also expected to grow, albeit modestly.",
              "What that means is that by 2050, nonhydro renewables will account for more than a third of global power generationa\u0302\u0080\u0094a huge increase from the 2014 level of 6 percent.",
              "To put it another way, between now and 2050, wind and solar are expected to grow four to five times faster than every other source of power.",
              "Fossil fuels will dominate energy use through 2050.",
              "This is because of the massive investments that have already been made and because of the superior energy intensity and reliability of fossil fuels.",
              "The mix, however, will change.",
              "Gas will continue to grow quickly, but the global demand for coal will likely peak around 2025.",
              "Growth in the use of oil, which is predominantly used for transport, will slow down as vehicles get more efficient and more electric;",
              "here, peak demand could come as soon as 2030.",
              "By 2050, the research estimates that coal will be down to just 16 percent of global power generation (from 41 percent now) and fossil fuels to 38 percent (from 66 percent now).",
              "Overall, though, coal, oil, and, gas will continue to be 74 percent of primary energy demand, down from 82 percent now.",
              "After that, the rate of decline is likely to accelerate.",
              "Energy-related greenhouse-gas emissions will rise 14 percent in the next 20 years.",
              "That is not what needs to happen to keep the planet from warming another two degrees, the goal of the 2015 Paris climate conference.",
              "Around 2035, though, emissions will flatten and then fall, for two main reasons.",
              "First, cars and trucks will be cleaner, due to more efficient engines and the deployment of electric vehicles.",
              "Second, there is the shift in the power industry toward gas and renewables discussed above.",
              "The countervailing trends are that there are likely to be some 1.",
              "5 billion more people by 2035, and global GDP will rise by about half over that period.",
              "All those people will need to eat and work, and that means more energy.",
              "Can innovation help meet ever-growing demand for resources?",
              "The world is full of unpredictable and sometimes wonderful surprises, so I accept that these numbers are unlikely to be perfect.",

              "Other sources see different outlooks.",
              "Concerted global action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, for example, could change the arc of these trends.",
              "Technological disruptions could also bend the curve.",
              "For business and political leaders, though, the implications are clear.",
              "Given that global energy demand will grow, it is likely that prices will continue to be volatile.",
              "Better energy efficiency, then, is an important way to reduce related risks.",

              "\u201d Therefore, economic competitiveness is what will drive continued growth going forward, according to Bolinger.",
              "\u201cCompetitiveness really comes down to weighing cost versus value,\u201d he said.",
              "On the cost side of the equation are upfront installation costs (often referred to as capital costs), operating costs, and financing costs.",
              "Capacity factor and useful life also factor into the calculation.",
              "On the value side, Bolinger focused exclusively on energy and capacity value.",
              "He said ancillary services and renewable energy credits (RECs) can also add value, but few renewable projects are providing ancillary services and RECs vary widely based on location so the value is difficult to generalize.",
              "Since 2010, the cost curves for both wind and solar have declined steadily.",
              "Average installed costs for wind have fallen by 40%, while solar has plummeted 70%.",
              "Furthermore, operating costs have also declined as the useful life of projects has steadily increased\u2014a 30-year useful life is now common for both wind and solar projects.",

              "Wind capacity factors have risen from about 30% a decade ago to more than 40% today.",

              "Solar capacity factors increased from about 20% to 25% between 2010 and 2013, but have remained stagnant since then.",
              "The increase resulted from higher inverter loading ratios, greater use of single-axis tracking, and the buildout of projects in sunny areas.",
              "Bolinger said as the market has expanded in less-sunny regions, the reduction in average solar insolation has offset the other factors, causing average capacity factors to stagnate.",

              "1%/year.",
              "He emphasized that the value was higher than is often reported by plant operators, but said LBNL researchers were tracking all-in performance for the entire plant rather than just module degradation.",
              "He also noted that curtailment could factor into the decline, because curtailment tends to increase with increased market penetration.",
              "The net effect of capital, operating, and financing cost declines, as well as capacity factor and useful life increases, has been a significant decrease in PPA prices\u2014now at all-time lows.",
              "\u201cFor both wind and solar, average PPA prices have declined by about 80% since 2009,\u201d Bolinger reported.",

              "\u201cUtility-scale PV PPA prices have come down quite a bit in recent years,\u201d Bolinger noted.",
              "\u201cWhether wind or solar is more expensive or cheaper really depends on what region of the country you\u2019re looking at.",
              "\u201d Furthermore, wind and solar are both increasingly competitive to the cost of burning natural gas in an existing combined cycle gas turbine.",
              "\u201cWe\u2019re not even considering the capital cost of building the combined cycle plant to begin with.",
              "We\u2019re just looking at fuel costs, which are obviously just a subset of gas plant operating costs, and even on that basis, wind and solar have been pretty competitive in recent years,\u201d Bolinger said.",
              "Concerning wholesale market value for wind and solar generation, Bolinger suggested the calculation depends on three main factors.",
              "They are: While these factors vary greatly depending on the region of the country examined, a person can get a general understanding of the differences in value by looking at nationwide annual averages.",
              "For example, the combined energy and capacity value of a \u201cflat block of power,\u201d which is basically an around-the-clock block of power evaluated across all pricing nodes, was about $30/MWh in 2019.",
              "When researchers factored in solar and wind profiles, congestion, and curtailment elements, wind\u2019s resulting market value was found to be about $20/MWh, basically 33% below the value of a flat block of power.",
              "On the other hand, the market value of solar power was actually 10% higher than the value of a flat block of power.",
              "The researchers also broke the numbers down by region.",
              "Their findings indicated that after \u201cnetting out\u201d PPA prices, solar had positive net value, and also greater net value than wind, in four of the six regions studied (CAISO, SPP, ERCOT, and PJM)\u2014MISO and ISO-NE were the two exceptions.",
              "\u201cThe fact that solar tends to provide greater net value than wind might be one reason why solar has really skyrocketed to the top of grid interconnection queues across the country,\u201d Bolinger said.",
              "According to data gleaned from 37 interconnection queues studied across the U.",
              "S.",
              ", solar, storage, and wind have grown steadily in the queue since 2015.",

              "Although not all capacity proposed in the queue will ultimately be built, the trends are significant.",
              "Looking ahead, the phase-down of federal tax credits will push wind and solar PPA prices higher, Bolinger said, as wind and solar\u2019s market value likely continues to decline with growing market share.",

              "In a paper recently published in Applied Energy, researchers from MIT and Princeton University examine battery storage to determine the key drivers that impact its economic value, how that value may change with increasing deployment over time, and the implications for the long-term cost-effectiveness of storage.",
              "\u201cBattery storage helps make better use of electricity system assets, including wind and solar farms, natural gas power plants, and transmission lines, and can defer or eliminate unnecessary investment in these capital-intensive assets,\u201d says Dharik Mallapragada, the paper\u2019s lead author.",
              "\u201cOur paper demonstrates that this \u2018capacity deferral,\u2019 or substitution of batteries for generation or transmission capacity, is the primary source of storage value.",
              "\u201d Other sources of storage value include providing operating reserves to electricity system operators, avoiding fuel cost and wear and tear incurred by cycling on and off gas-fired power plants, and shifting energy from low price periods to high value periods\u2014but the paper showed that these sources are secondary in importance to value from avoiding capacity investments.",

              "\u201cThat creates a race between the declining cost of batteries and their declining value, and our paper demonstrates that the cost of batteries must continue to fall if storage is to play a major role in electricity systems.\u201d The study\u2019s key findings include: Relevance to policymakers The results of the study highlight the importance of reforming electricity market structures or contracting practices to enable storage developers to monetize the value from substituting generation and transmission capacity\u2014a central component of their economic viability.",

              "\u201cDepending on their administrative design and market rules, capacity markets may or may not adequately compensate storage for providing energy during peak load periods.",
              "\u201d In addition, Mallapragada notes that developers and integrated utilities in regulated markets can implicitly capture capacity substitution value through integrated development of wind, solar, and energy storage projects.",
              "Recent project announcements support the observation that this may be a preferred method for capturing storage value.",
              "Implications for the low-carbon energy transition The economic value of energy storage is closely tied to other major trends impacting today\u2019s power system, most notably the increasing penetration of wind and solar generation.",
              "However, in some cases, the continued decline of wind and solar costs could negatively impact storage value, which could create pressure to reduce storage costs in order to remain cost-effective.",
              "\u201cIt is a common perception that battery storage and wind and solar power are complementary,\u201d says Sepulveda.",
              "\u201cOur results show that is true, and that all else equal, more solar and wind means greater storage value.",

              "Given the long-term cost declines projected for wind and solar, I think this is an important consideration for storage technology developers.",
              "\u201d The relationship between wind and solar cost and storage value is even more complex, the study found.",
              "\u201cSince storage derives much of its value from capacity deferral, going into this research, my expectation was that the cheaper wind and solar gets, the lower the value of energy storage will become, but our paper shows that is not always the case,\u201d explains Mallapragada.",
              "\u201cThere are some scenarios where other factors that contribute to storage value, such as increases in transmission capacity deferral, outweigh the reduction in wind and solar deferral value, resulting in higher overall storage value.",
              "\u201d Battery storage is increasingly competing with natural gas-fired power plants to provide reliable capacity for peak demand periods, but the researchers also find that adding one megawatt (MW) of storage power capacity displaces less than one MW of natural gas generation.",
              "The reason: to shut down 1 MW of gas capacity, storage must not only provide 1 MW of power output, but also be capable of sustaining production for as many hours in a row as the gas capacity operates.",
              "That means you need many hours of energy storage capacity (megawatt-hours) as well.",
              "The study also finds that this capacity substitution ratio declines as storage tries to displace more gas capacity.",

              "Excluding China, global hydropower additions are expected to be stable during the remainder of the forecast period (2021\u201025), ranging from 10 GW to 13 GW per year.",

              "In Latin America, more than half of growth in 2021-25 is in Colombia, Argentina and Brazil.",
              "Large reservoir projects in Colombia and Argentina are expected to be commissioned at the end of the forecast period, while annual additions slow in Brazil after commissioning of the last phases of Belo Monte in 2019.",
              "Small-scale hydroelectric projects awarded through recent tenders make up new capacity additions in Brazil through 2025.",
              "Europe\u2019s growth between 2021 and 2025 is led by Turkey, with large projects driving development in 2020 and 2021 and slower deployment during 2023-25 as the FiT for small and medium-sized run-of-river plants is phased out.",
              "Excluding Turkey, more than half of new hydropower capacity additions in Europe will be pumped storage, notably in Switzerland, Portugal and Austria.",
              "Europe\u2019s pumped storage growth is prompted by the need for system flexibility to integrate increasing shares of variable renewable electricity.",
              "Hydropower development in Africa is led by the commissioning of units in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Angola.",
              "Nevertheless, hydropower capacity growth during 2023\u201025 could be 50% higher per year on average if project development were accelerated.",
              "This would require earlier commissioning of pumped storage plants currently under development in China and fewer interruptions of projects under construction in Africa and Latin America.",
              "Development lead times could also be shortened with improved financing conditions, fewer construction delays, and more efficient permitting and licensing within sustainability guidelines.",
              "Global hydropower generation (excluding pumped storage) is forecast to increase 9.",
              "5% over the forecast period, rising from 4 250 TWh in 2019 to 4 650 TWh in 2025, and remain the world\u2019s largest source of renewable generation.",
              "The increase results mainly from new capacity in markets that lead greenfield project development: the largest single increase (+107 TWh) is in a country, China, followed by the Asia Pacific region, where capacity growth is accelerating.",
              "However, another reason for the generation increase is the assumption that operating conditions over the forecast period will return to pre-2019 levels in several countries after weather conditions caused output to fall from 2018 to 2019.",
              "This expectation is prevalent in parts of North America, Europe and Latin America, which are forecast to account for a higher share of the increase in global generation during 2020-25 despite having a lower share of new capacity additions.",
              "Hydropower generation in the United States was down 21 TWh (-7%) in 2019 due to droughts and wildfires in the Pacific Northwest, while droughts also caused substantial declines in Argentina, Paraguay and Mexico.",
              "Lower precipitation in parts of Europe, coupled with a heatwave, caused 2019 year-on-year declines of 10% in Norway, 31% in Spain and 13% in France, which have one-third of Europe\u2019s fleet.",
              "Load factors in these seven countries are assumed to return to pre-2019 levels by 2025, and their increased output is forecast to make up 16% of the global increase in hydropower generation.",
              "Hydropower will therefore account for 16% of the world\u2019s electricity generation by 2025.",
              "To sustain this level, output from existing hydropower plants needs to be maintained;",
              "however, substantial amounts of generation will come from fleets that are ageing.",
              "By 2025, 40% of the world\u2019s hydropower output will be from countries with fleets that are more than 40 years old, the age at which the first major refurbishments are undertaken to either maintain or increase performance.",
              "Roughly two-thirds of this generation is in North America and Europe, where the weighted average age of the fleet is 45 to 51 years old.",
              "Maintaining output from these fleets over the forecast period will therefore require significant investments in refurbishment and modernisation.",

              "Major deployment of biomass power projects is concentrated in relatively few countries, with just ten nations accounting for 90% of new capacity in 2019.",
              "Of these, China, Brazil, Japan and the United Kingdom have been the most affected by the pandemic, so potential exists for some project delivery delays.",

              "Annual additions fall to around 5 GW to 6 GW per year over the remainder of the forecast period.",

              "g. Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom).",
              "Capacity awarded in technology-neutral auctions has been relatively low because of generally higher generation costs for bioenergy compared with wind or utility solar PV technologies, and limited cost reduction potential for bioenergy technologies.",
              "Technology-specific auctions for bioenergy are not widespread.",
              "China has also announced that subsidies for biomass-based power projects will switch from the current FiT system to auctions in 2021, with a strong emphasis on projects that harness co\u2010generation and utilise fuels produced from agricultural or municipal waste.",

              "China leads expansion, with 200 MW expected to come online this year under the generous FiT scheme.",

              "However, the gap between both our main and accelerated case forecasts and the trajectory necessary to meet Net Zero by 2050 remains significant.",
              "Annual capacity growth under the IEA Net Zero Scenario during 2021-2026 needs to be 80% faster than in our accelerated case, implying that governments need to not only address policy and implementation challenges, but also to increase their ambition.",
              "Globally, we anticipate renewable capacity to expand by over 1 800 GW, or over 60%, in our main case forecast to 2026, accounting for almost 95% of the increase in total power capacity worldwide.",

              "For China, last year\u2019s forecast reflected the phase-out of subsidies at the end of 2020 and the resulting policy uncertainty for onshore wind and solar PV.",
              "However, China\u2019s subsequent commitment to net zero by 2060 has led to new targets, such as 40% of all electricity consumed to be from non-fossil generation by 2030 and a capacity target of 1 200 GW wind and solar PV by the same year, all reflected in our updated forecast.",
              "In Europe, the upward revision stems from larger auction volumes in most EU member countries to accelerate deployment towards 2030 renewable energy targets, a growing market for corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) and the increasing attractiveness of self-consumption for distributed PV.",
              "The economic recovery plan for Europe, which will provide over EUR 800 billion (USD 940 billion) in the form of loans and grants, should partly contribute to facilitating the financing of renewables.",

              "In India the forecast is slightly revised upward, especially for solar PV, due to deployment acceleration towards the government\u2019s ambitious renewables target of 500 GW by 2030 and additional policies introduced to improve the attractiveness of distributed PV.",
              "Higher renewable energy targets for 2030 in Japan, improved incentive schemes providing stable remuneration for solar PV developers in Korea and increased capacity targets in Viet Nam all support our higher forecast.",
              "In Latin America, resumed competitive auctions following delays due to the Covid-19 crisis remain a key driver for utility-scale wind and solar PV development.",

              "China, Europe and the United States together account for 80% of global onshore wind expansion of 451 GW during 2021-2025.",
              "In general, the challenges of permitting, social acceptance, grid connection and integration combined to limit faster onshore wind growth.",
              "These challenges prevent developers from participating in wind-specific or technology-neutral auctions, especially when permitting and grid connection agreements are required for participation.",
              "In addition, higher steel and transport costs have seen turbine prices rise by 10-25% in several markets, increasing challenges associated with project financing and profitability.",
              "In our accelerated case, global onshore wind capacity growth is almost 30% higher, assuming that governments tackle social acceptance and expand network capacity faster and tackle grid integration challenges.",
              "In addition, the accelerated case assumes countries introduce higher auction capacity or increase auction participation as a result of smoother permitting.",
              "In this case, annual additions reach 110 GW by 2026, slightly higher than the record level achieved in 2020.",
              "The offshore wind market is forecast to accelerate in 2021, with additions reaching 11 GW, almost double compared with last year.",
              "This is driven by expansion in China, as developers rush to secure expiring national subsidies.",
              "Despite China\u2019s growth slowing through to 2026, offshore annual capacity additions reach 21 GW globally thanks to rapid expansion in new markets beyond the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands.",
              "Large-scale projects are expected to be commissioned in France, Chinese Taipei, Korea, Viet Nam, Japan and the United States in the next five years, pushing our forecast up.",

              "The share of offshore capacity in overall annual wind additions reaches over 20% in the main case, up from 5% in 2020, breaking a record at the end of our forecast period.",
              "However, faster offshore and onshore grid expansion in the United Kingdom and the European Union, rapid cost decline and strong provincial-level policies in China, and the early-commissioning of large-scale pipeline in the United States together could push cumulative global offshore wind capacity to 134 GW in 2026 in the accelerated case.",

              "Relatively higher investment and generation costs compared with wind and solar PV, the lack of policy support and limited recognition of the flexibility of dispatchable renewables prevent their faster expansion.",
              "For hydropower, annual additions are volatile according to the commissioning deadlines of large reservoir projects in China, India and Turkey.",
              "These three large markets drive our main case forecast of 153 GW over 2021-2026, which is similar to the deployment achieved in the last five years.",

              "China provides almost 60% of this new capacity due to waste-to-energy projects driven by growing urbanisation.",
              "Beyond China, supply chain challenges, lack of policy support and relatively high generation costs contribute to the slowdown in expansion.",

              "\u2018The project is really to test how we can use the renewable energy from the grid and transform it into hydrogen, that can be used either in industry or for energy applications,\u2019 said Caroline Le Mer, Hydrogen Energy Europe Director at Air Liquide, which coordinates the project.",
              "Image credit: Horizon Spikes The plant opened in September 2018 and will run for 15 years, using the same electrolysing process as H2FUTURE and REFHYNE to produce hydrogen, which is known as proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis.",

              "For energy purchases dominated by solar power, an entity generates far more electricity than it uses during the afternoon and sells the excess.",
              "Then at nighttime it purchases power from the grid, which is much more carbon-intensive if generated by burning of fossil fuels.",
              "The use of annual averages of the carbon dioxide associated with grid power is valid only when fluctuations in renewable generation are small, or when all excess renewables can be stored.",
              "Places like California, Hawaii and some European countries experience large fluctuations in carbon content due to existing renewables, and do not yet have enough storage capacity to capture all excess electricity.",

              "Instead, the difference between emissions reductions from wind and solar generation is only related to the difference in carbon footprint between the two technologies.",
              "All renewable technologies have a small amount of carbon dioxide associated with their output due to the emissions from manufacturing and installing them, as detailed in the study, but how the renewable energy is used can have a much larger impact on the environment.",
              "\u201cBoth the carbon footprint of a large consumer and the environmental value of renewable energy assets depend on the grid they interact with,\u201d said energy resources engineering PhD student Jacques de Chalendar, lead author of the study.",

              "\u201d The problem with investing in more solar panels in California is that the output often will not cause fossil fuel based generators to turn off, because they are already idle at the time of day the solar panels will produce power.",
              "In the paper\u2019s case study, which approximated a hypothetical 1 megawatt constant load in California, short-term annual and hourly carbon estimates did not show significant differences in 2018.",

              "Using annual accounting, a 100 percent solar strategy in 2025 would reduce carbon emissions by 119 percent of the hypothetical company\u2019s carbon footprint.",
              "Using hourly emissions, though, the number shrinks to 66 percent, according to the study.",
              "For a 100 percent wind power strategy, annual averages indicate 131 percent carbon reductions, which actually jumps to 135 percent using hourly data.",
              "\u201cIn California, gas is often the marginal generation source and has a higher emissions rate than average grid power, which is why purchasing renewables can result in a net negative carbon footprint,\u201d said de Chalendar.",

              "The data could also help consumers decide whether they should invest in large-scale energy storage projects as the most economical way to meet their carbon targets.",
              "This is because energy storage allows consumers to draw electricity from the grid during low-carbon periods and store it for later use.",
              "Stanford University, for example, recently electrified its heating and cooling system and added thermal storage to cut emissions to a third of their 2014 peak levels.",
              "By using its energy storage to maximize purchases of electricity in the afternoon when solar power dominates the California grid, Stanford could reduce emissions from heating and cooling by an additional 40 percent, according to a study published earlier this month by the authors of this paper.",
              "Location-specific analyses might suggest different types of low-carbon investments and strategies for other regions, the paper notes.",
              "In Great Britain, for example, grid carbon intensity is currently lower at night, meaning different types of renewable investments or consumption behaviors might be better.",

              "Overall, NREL finds multiple pathways to 100% clean electricity by 2035 that would produce significant benefits, but the exact technology mix and costs will be determined by research and development (R&D), manufacturing, and infrastructure investment decisions over the next decade.",

              "Unlike other NREL studies, the 2035 study scenarios consider many new factors: a 2035 full decarbonization timeframe, higher levels of electrification and an associated increase in electricity demand, increased electricity demand from carbon dioxide removal technologies and clean fuels production, higher reliance on existing commercial renewable energy generation technologies, and greater diversity of seasonal storage solutions.",
              "For each scenario, NREL modeled the least-cost generation, energy storage, and transmission investment portfolio to maintain safe and reliable power during all hours of the year.",

              "As modeled, wind and solar energy provide 60%\u201380% of generation in the least-cost electricity mix in 2035, and the overall generation capacity grows to roughly three times the 2020 level by 2035\u2014including a combined 2 terawatts of wind and solar.",
              "To achieve those levels would require an additional 40\u201390 gigawatts of solar on the grid per year and 70\u2013150 gigawatts of wind per year by the end of this decade under this modeled scenario.",
              "That's more than four times the current annual deployment levels for each technology.",
              "If there are challenges with siting and land use to be able to deploy this new generation capacity and associated transmission, nuclear capacity helps make up the difference and more than doubles today's installed capacity by 2035.",
