    "response": "The Starry Night is one of Vincent van Gogh's most celebrated works. He painted it in 1889, while he was staying at an asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, France, after suffering a mental breakdown[^1^]. The painting is based on van Gogh's direct observations as well as his imagination, memories, and emotions[^1^]. He was particularly fascinated by the night sky and the effects of light and color[^2^]. He wrote to his brother Theo: \"This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big.\"[^3^] He also wrote to his sister Willemien: \"It often seems to me that the night is much more alive and richly coloured than the day.\"[^2^] The painting shows a swirling sky filled with stars, a crescent moon, and a village below. The steeple of the church resembles those in his native Holland, not in France[^1^]. The cypress trees on the left are flame-like and contrast with the calmness of the houses[^2^]. The painting expresses van Gogh's feelings of wonder, loneliness, and hope.",

              "The Starry Night, a moderately abstract landscape painting (1889) of an expressive night sky over a small hillside village, one of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh\u2019s most celebrated works.",
              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",
              "Amid all this animation, a structured village sits in the distance on the lower right of the canvas.",
              "Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills.",
              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",
              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",
              "The painting was one of van Gogh\u2019s late works, as he committed suicide the following year.",
              "His artistic career was brief, comprising only 10 years, but it was very productive.",
              "He left more than 800 paintings and 700 to 850 drawings to his brother.",
              "When the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City purchased The Starry Night from a private collector in 1941, it was not well known, but it has since become one of van Gogh\u2019s most famous, if not one of the most recognized, works in the art history canon."

              "Through different hands, The Starry Night eventually found its way to the French art dealer Paul Rosenberg, from whom the MOMA acquired it in 1941.",
              "The Starry Night original painting by Vincent van Gogh, painted in 1889, is estimated to be worth over $100 million.",
              "However, this painting is one of van Gogh\u2019s masterpieces and it can also be argued that there cannot be a price for it \u2013 it is priceless.",

              "The Starry Night, a moderately abstract landscape painting (1889) of an expressive night sky over a small hillside village, one of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh\u2019s most celebrated works.",
              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",
              "Amid all this animation, a structured village sits in the distance on the lower right of the canvas.",
              "Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills.",
              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",
              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",
              "The painting was one of van Gogh\u2019s late works, as he committed suicide the following year.",
              "His artistic career was brief, comprising only 10 years, but it was very productive.",
              "He left more than 800 paintings and 700 to 850 drawings to his brother.",
              "When the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City purchased The Starry Night from a private collector in 1941, it was not well known, but it has since become one of van Gogh\u2019s most famous, if not one of the most recognized, works in the art history canon."

              "[10][11] Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived,[12] allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.",
              "[13] During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum in Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.",
              "[14] During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J.",

              "While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper;",
              "eventually, he would base newer variations on previous versions.",
              "The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains.",
              "In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field.",
              "Van Gogh exaggerated their size in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.",

              "In his 9 June letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days.",
              "[19][20][L 3][15] Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889.",
              "[19][L 4] This is F719 Green Wheat Field with Cypress, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted en plein air.",
              "[19] F1548 Wheatfield, Saint-Re\u0301my de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it.",
              "Two days later, Vincent wrote to Theo stating that he had painted \"a starry sky\".",
              "[21][L 1] The Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window.",
              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",
              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",
              "[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse (F1541r) was also a study for the painting.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",
              "When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he did not send.",
              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",

              "And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big\u2014another failure\u2014and I have had my fill of that.\"",
              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",

              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",

              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",

              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",

              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",

              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",

              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",

              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",

              "Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills.",
              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",

              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",

              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",
              "The painting was one of van Gogh\u2019s late works, as he committed suicide the following year.",

              "Van Gogh saw the night as a period of reflection and meditation after a day of activity, says MoMA curatorial assistant Jennifer Field, one of the organizers of the exhibition.",
              "\"It was also this kind of metaphor for the cycle of life.",
              "And he linked this with the changing of the seasons.\"",
              "In Arles, in 1888 and 1889, van Gogh's paintings took on a mystical, dreamlike quality.",
              "Straight lines became wavy, colors intensified, thick paint became thicker, sometimes squeezed straight onto the canvas from the tube.",
              "Some of these changes were later taken as a sign of his madness, and even van Gogh feared that \"some of my pictures certainly show traces of having been painted by a sick man.\"",
              "But there was premeditation and technique behind these distortions, as he tried to put a sense of life's mysteries into paint.",
              "In a letter to Wil, he explained that \"the bizarre lines, purposely selected and multiplied, meandering all through the picture, may fail to give the garden a vulgar resemblance, but may present it to our minds as seen in a dream, depicting its character, and at the same time stranger than it is in reality.\"",
              "The artist's focus on the relationship between dreams and reality\u2014and life and death\u2014had a profound meaning for him, as he had confided to Theo in a letter a year before his first crisis in Arles.",
              "\"Looking at the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I dream over the black dots representing towns and villages on a map.",
              "Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France?",

              "His interest in mixing dreams and reality, observation and imagination, is particularly evident in the night paintings he made in Arles and Saint-Re\u0301my in 1889 and 1890, in which he not only conquered the difficulties of using color to depict darkness but also went a long way toward capturing the spiritual and symbolic meanings that he saw in the night.",
              "\"He lived at night,\" says Pissarro.",
              "\"He didn't sleep until three or four in the morning.",

              "Van Gogh told Theo that in depicting the interior of a night cafe\u0301, where he had slept among the night prowlers of Arles, \"I have tried to express the terrible passions of humanity by means of red and green.\"",
              "He stayed up three consecutive nights to paint the \"rotten joint,\" he said.",

              "His first painting of the starry sky, The Starry Night over the Rho\u0302ne (1888), was another exercise in contrasting complementary colors (pairs chosen to heighten each other's impact).",
              "This time, the effect of the painting, with its greenish blue sky, violet-hued town and yellow gas\u00adlight, was more romantic.",
              "He wrote Wil that he had painted it \"at night under a gas jet.\"",
              "Van Gogh considered his now-iconic The Starry Night, which he painted from his barred window at Saint-Re\u0301my, a failed attempt at abstraction.",

              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",

              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",

              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",
              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",

              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",

              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",

              "Van Gogh made a number of sketches for the painting, of which F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm is typical.",
              "It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside.",
              "In his 9 June letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days.",
              "[19][20][L 3][15] Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889.",
              "[19][L 4] This is F719 Green Wheat Field with Cypress, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted en plein air.",
              "[19] F1548 Wheatfield, Saint-Re\u0301my de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it.",
              "Two days later, Vincent wrote to Theo stating that he had painted \"a starry sky\".",
              "[21][L 1] The Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window.",
              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",
              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",
              "[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse (F1541r) was also a study for the painting.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",
              "When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he did not send.",
              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",
              ".",
              ".",
              ".",
              "But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big\u2014another failure\u2014and I have had my fill of that.\"",
              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",
              "These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.",
              "[63] Harvard astronomer Charles A.",
              "Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of The Starry Night contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.",

              "L.",
              "A.)",
              ".",
              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",
              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",
              "Theo's widow Jo became the caretaker of Van Gogh's legacy.",

              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",
              "Amid all this animation, a structured village sits in the distance on the lower right of the canvas.",
              "Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills.",
              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",
              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",

              "We see the top tendril nestling itself in-between some of the large yellow orbs of stars in the sky.",
              "Similarly, we can also notice the long spiral of the church situated in the middle ground of the composition.",
              "This is echoed with the cypress tree in the foreground.",
              "Looking at the middle ground, we see what appears to be a small village, the said church as the central focal point.",
              "To the right, the village is flanked by a hilly area that flattens out from the right to the left side of the composition.",
              "An interesting fact about the village is that it was believed to be created from van Gogh\u2019s imagination, perhaps from sketches done of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "Some sources also suggest it could have been from his memories of where he grew up, such as the church steeple resembles churches from Holland and apparently not churches found in France.",

              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",
              "Amid all this animation, a structured village sits in the distance on the lower right of the canvas.",
              "Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills.",
              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",
              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",

              "The setting is one that viewers can relate to and van Gogh \u0301s swirling sky directs the viewer \u0301s eye around the painting, with spacing between the stars and the curving contours creating a dot-to-dot effect.",
              "These internal elements ensure fluidity and such contours were important for the artist even though they were becoming less significant for other Impressionists.",
              "Thus Starry Night \u0301s composition was distinct from the Impressionist technique of the 19th century.",
              "The artist was aware that his Starry Night composition was somewhat surreal and stylized and in a letter to his brother he even referred to \"exaggerations in terms of composition.",
              "\" The vivid style chosen by van Gogh was unusual - he chose lines to portray this night scene when silhouettes would have been a more obvious choice.",
              "In Starry Night contoured forms are a means of expression and they are used to convey emotion.",
              "Many feel that van Gogh \u0301s turbulent quest to overcome his illness is reflected in the dimness of the night sky.",
              "The village is painted with dark colors but the brightly lit windows create a sense of comfort.",
              "The village is peaceful in comparison to the dramatic night sky and the silence of the night can almost be felt in Starry Night.",
              "The steeple dominates the village and symbolizes unity in the town.",
              "In terms of composition, the church steeple gives an impression of size and isolation.",
              "In the left foreground is a curvy cypress tree which is typically associated with mourning.",
              "It is painted in the same way as the sky with fluid lines which enhances the flow of the Starry Night painting well as its easiness on the eye.",
              "Starry Night Vincent van Gogh Van Gogh \u0301s choice of color in Starry Night has been much debated, particularly the dominance of yellow in this and other late works.",
              "Some believe van Gogh may have been suffering from lead poisoning or a type of brain disease and that this explains his strange use of color in later paintings.",
              "Van Gogh's use of white and yellow creates a spiral effect and draws attention to the sky.",
              "Vertical lines such as the cypress tree and church tower softly break up the composition without retracting from the powerful night sky depicted in Starry Night.",
              "Vincent van Gogh \u0301s choice of dark blues and greens were complemented with touches of mint green showing the reflection of the moon.",
              "The buildings in the centre of the painting are small blocks of yellows, oranges, and greens with a dash of red to the left of the church.",

              "Starry Night Vincent van Gogh There are various interpretations of Starry Night and one is that this canvas depicts hope.",
              "It seems that van Gogh was showing that even with a dark night such as this it is still possible to see light in the windows of the houses.",
              "Furthermore, with shining stars filling the sky, there is always light to guide you.",
              "It seems that van Gogh was finally being cured of his illness and had essentially found his heaven.",
              "He also knew that in death he would be at peace and further portrays this by using bold colors in the Starry Night painting.",
              "In a letter to his brother, Theo, van Gogh comments: \"I should not be surprised if you liked the Starry Night and the Ploughed Fields, there is a greater quiet about them than in the other canvases.",
