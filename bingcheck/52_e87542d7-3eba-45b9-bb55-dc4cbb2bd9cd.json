    "query": "What was the earliest recorded instance of humans using fermented beverages for their medicinal properties?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. According to the search results, the earliest recorded instance of humans using fermented beverages for their medicinal properties dates back to **500 BCE**, when the Chinese used **moldy soybean curds** as an antibiotic treatment for boils and carbuncles[^1^]. This was the first documented use of fermented food as medicine. Along with moldy soybean curds, moldy cheese was also used to treat infected wounds[^1^].\n\nFermentation is a natural process that converts sugars into products that can be useful to humans. The history of fermentation starts as far back as **10,000 B.C.E.**, when the first human civilization emerged in a region called the fertile crescent (today\u2019s Middle East)[^2^]. People back then did not have today\u2019s scientific knowledge, but they were still able to analyze the world and develop technology. Since those ancient times, fermentation has been used as a tool mainly for food preservation[^2^].\n\nFermented foods weren't just used for preservation during the history of probiotics - they were also believed to have medicinal properties[^5^]. For example, several Native American civilizations developed alcoholic beverages in pre-Columbian times that were used for ceremonial and medicinal purposes[^6^]. A variety of fermented beverages from the Andes region of South America were created from corn, grapes or apples, called \u201cchicha\u201d[^6^]. In the sixteenth century, alcohol (called \u201cspirits\u201d) was used largely for medicinal purposes[^6^].\n\nFermentation is also one of the main contributors to humanity\u2019s development. In fact, it can be considered the very first use of biotechnology[^2^]. Biotechnology is the use of living systems or living organisms to develop a technology. Fermentation shows us that microorganisms can be a great biotechnological resource. Today, fermentation remains essential to many of the industries that support human society, just as it was in 10,000 B.C.E.![^2^]",

              "Most research focuses on fermented dairy products.",
              "However, vegetables such as cabbages, carrots, garlic, soybeans, olives, cucumbers, onions, turnips, radishes, cauliflower and peppers, in addition to fruits such as lemons or berries, offer novel flavors and textures\u2014partly explaining why home fermentation, and particularly lactic acid fermentation, is becoming an increasingly popular trend.",
              "Whether keepers of culinary tradition, those interested in potential health benefits or folks who simply enjoy trying new foods, fermentation enthusiasts are bringing new life to this ancient practice.",
              "Lactic acid fermentation, or lacto-fermentation, is among the most common methods and one of the easiest to experiment with at home.",
              "It is an anaerobic process whereby lactic acid bacteria, mainly Lactobacillus species, convert sugar into lactic acid, which acts as a preservative.",
              "Salt plays a pivotal role in traditional fermentation by creating conditions that favor the bacteria, preventing the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, pulling water and nutrients from the substrate and adding flavor.",
              "The earliest record of fermentation dates back as far as 6000 B.",
              "C.",
              "in the Fertile Crescent\u2014and nearly every civilization since has included at least one fermented food in its culinary heritage.",
              "From Korean kimchi and Indian chutneys to the ubiquitous sauerkraut, yogurt and cheese, global cultures have crafted unique flavors and traditions around fermentation.",

              "Nonetheless, the authors write that \u201calthough documenting efficacy of probiotics is still emerging, a growing number of consumers and health-care professionals are interested in trying probiotics,\u201d and that people might \u201calso be interested in increasing the levels of live active cultures in their diet.",
              "Such diets have not been evaluated strictly, but could be recommended based on the emerging body of evidence that a variety of probiotics is beneficial.",

              "Traditional lacto-fermentation utilizes the microflora present on vegetables and a lactic acid bacteria starter culture (whey).",
              "Once upon a time, all pickles were naturally fermented through lacto-fermentation, which is why some people use the terms \u201cpickled\u201d and \u201cfermented\u201d synonymously.",
              "In modern times, this is no longer the case.",
              "In large-scale food manufacturing practices, vegetables are washed in diluted chlorine solutions to destroy or inactivate existing microflora, and acetic acid (which, along with water, is a main component of vinegar) is used instead of lactic acid.",
