              "The Starry Night, a moderately abstract landscape painting (1889) of an expressive night sky over a small hillside village, one of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh\u2019s most celebrated works.",
              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",
              "Amid all this animation, a structured village sits in the distance on the lower right of the canvas.",
              "Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills.",
              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",
              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",
              "The painting was one of van Gogh\u2019s late works, as he committed suicide the following year.",
              "His artistic career was brief, comprising only 10 years, but it was very productive.",
              "He left more than 800 paintings and 700 to 850 drawings to his brother.",
              "When the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City purchased The Starry Night from a private collector in 1941, it was not well known, but it has since become one of van Gogh\u2019s most famous, if not one of the most recognized, works in the art history canon."

              "Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.",

              "Widely regarded as Van Gogh's magnum opus,[4][5] The Starry Night is one of the most recognizable paintings in Western art.",
              "[6][7] In the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear,[8][9] Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889.",
              "[10][11] Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived,[12] allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.",
              "[13] During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum in Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.",
              "[14] During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J.",
              "Paul Getty Museum, and the blue self-portrait from September 1889, in the Muse\u0301e d'Orsay.",

              "[1][15][16][L 1] Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory.",
              "The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east,[1][2][17][18] a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times,[citation needed] including The Starry Night.",
              "\"Through the iron-barred window,\" he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, \"I can see an enclosed square of wheat .",

              "[2][L 2] Van Gogh depicted the view at different times of the day and under various weather conditions, such as the sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain.",
              "While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper;",
              "eventually, he would base newer variations on previous versions.",
              "The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains.",
              "In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field.",
              "Van Gogh exaggerated their size in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.",
              "One of the first paintings of the view was F611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Re\u0301my, now in Copenhagen.",
              "Van Gogh made a number of sketches for the painting, of which F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm is typical.",
              "It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside.",
              "In his 9 June letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days.",
              "[19][20][L 3][15] Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889.",
              "[19][L 4] This is F719 Green Wheat Field with Cypress, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted en plein air.",
              "[19] F1548 Wheatfield, Saint-Re\u0301my de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it.",
              "Two days later, Vincent wrote to Theo stating that he had painted \"a starry sky\".",
              "[21][L 1] The Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window.",
              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",
              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",
              "[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse (F1541r) was also a study for the painting.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",
              "When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he did not send.",
              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",
              ".",
              ".",
              ".",
              "But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big\u2014another failure\u2014and I have had my fill of that.\"",
              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",

              "they back this up by referring to the discussion of Christ on the Mount of Olives that he was currently engaged in, in his correspondence with Gauguin and Bernard.",
              "This too may be so;",
              "it is possible that premonitions of sufferings to come are articulated in the picture.",
              "But Biblical allegory is present throughout van Gogh's oeuvre, and he had no need of a special motif, least of all a starry sky, with all its associations of Arles and Utopian visions.",
              "Rather, van Gogh was trying to summarize;",
              "and his resume juxtaposed natural, scientific, philosophical and personal elements.",
              "Starry Night is an attempt to express a state of shock, and the cypresses, olive trees and mountains had acted as van Gogh's catalyst.",
              "More intensely, perhaps, than ever before, Van Gogh was interested in the material actuality of his motifs as much as in their symbolic dimensions.",
              "There had been hills in Arles too, of course.",
              "But they entered his panoramic scenes as idyllic touches.",
              "His landscapes included the harvest, passing trains, isolated farmsteads and distant towns;",
              "and the hills were simply one more detail.",
              "In Arles, Van Gogh's dream had been of the harmony of things and of the spatial dimensions in which that harmony could be felt.",
              "None of that remained.",
              "The hills rose up steep and abruptly now, menacing, threatening to drag the lonesome soul down into vertiginous depths.",
              "The Starry Night has risen to the peak of artistic achievements.",
              "Although Van Gogh sold only one painting in his whole life, \"Starry Night\" is an icon of modern art, the Mona Lisa for our time.",
              "As Leonardo da Vinci evoked a Renaissance ideal of serenity and self-control, Van Gogh defined how we see our own age - wracked with solitude and uncertainty.",

              "4) Physicist Jose Luis Aragon compared the turbulent play of light and dark in such works as \"Starry Night\" to the mathematical expression of turbulence in such natural occurrences as as whirlpools and air streams. He found they matched very closely.",
              "Two other Van Gogh paintings from 1890, WheatField with Crows and Road with Cypress and Star also feature this mathematical parallel.",
              "Aragon suggests that since the artist created these particular artworks during periods of extreme mental agitation, Van Gogh was uniquely able to accurately communication that agitation using precise gradations of luminescence.",
              "5) Analysts of \"Starry Night\" emphasize the symbolism of the stylized cypress tree in the foreground, linking it to death and Van Gogh's eventual suicide.",
              "However, the cypress also represents immortality.",
              "In the painting, the tree reaches into the sky, serving as a direct connection between the earth and the heavens.",
              "The artist may have been making more of a hopeful statement than many credit him with.",
              "This positive interpretation of the cypress symbolism hearkens back to a letter to his brother in which the artist likened death to a train that travels to the stars.",
              "6) In his 2015 book, \"Cosmographics,\" Michael Benson contends that the inspiration behind the distinctive swirls in the sky of Van Gogh's \"Starry Night\" is an 1845 drawing by astronomer William Parsons, Earl of Rosse, of the Whirlpool Galaxy.",
              "7) Research has confirmed that the dominant morning star in the painting is actually Venus, which was in a similar position at the time Van Gogh was working on \"Starry Night,\" and it would have shone brightly, just as Van Gogh painted it.",

              "Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.",

              "[6][7] In the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear,[8][9] Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889.",
              "[10][11] Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived,[12] allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.",
              "[13] During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum in Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.",
              "[14] During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J.",

              "The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east,[1][2][17][18] a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times,[citation needed] including The Starry Night.",

              "While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper;",
              "eventually, he would base newer variations on previous versions.",
              "The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains.",
              "In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field.",
              "Van Gogh exaggerated their size in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.",

              "[19][20][L 3][15] Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889.",
              "[19][L 4] This is F719 Green Wheat Field with Cypress, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted en plein air.",
              "[19] F1548 Wheatfield, Saint-Re\u0301my de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it.",
              "Two days later, Vincent wrote to Theo stating that he had painted \"a starry sky\".",

              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",
              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",
              "[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse (F1541r) was also a study for the painting.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",
              "When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he did not send.",
              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",

              "And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big\u2014another failure\u2014and I have had my fill of that.\"",
              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",
              "These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.",
              "[63] Harvard astronomer Charles A.",

              "A.)",
              ".",
              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",
              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",

              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",

              "\"Through the iron-barred window I can make out a square of wheat in an enclosure,\" he wrote in May of 1889, \"above which in the morning I see the sunrise in its glory.\"",
              "An end-of-the-world cataclysm invades Van Gogh's Starry Night, one of apocalypse filled with melting aerolites and comets adrift.",

              "The artist is looking down on a village from an imaginary viewpoint.",
              "It is framed by his newly-discovered motifs: at left a cypress towers skywards, at right a group of olive trees cluster into the cloud, and against the horizon run the undulating waves of the Alpilles.",
              "Van Gogh's treatment of his motifs prompts associations with fire, mist and the sea,and the elemental power of the natural scene combines with the intangible cosmic drama of the stars.",

              "Van Gogh is making various points here.",
              "First, his synthesis of motifs was his first echo of work with Gauguin since his breakdown.",
              "The night stars scene (this is something that had only just become important to Van Gogh) offers the visual imagination its most distinctive, unique field of activity, since the lack of light requires the compensatory use of visual memory.",
              "Van Gogh used the memory method in his nocturnal scene;",
              "his discovery of the luminous power of darkness was a personal aesthetic discovery and needed no Gauguin as catalyst.",
              "Second, Van Gogh was drawing upon his long-lost model Euge\u0300ne Delacroix again, and the principle of contrast;",
              "once he paused to reflect on what he had achieved in recent weeks he found his attention drawn back to the colourist techniques which he himself had developed so far.",
              "Third, he was searching for the essence of the landscape, its very being - a way of registering its symbolic power, its vitality, its flux and constancy, all in one.",
              "Interpretations of this Van Gogh night stars painting are legion.",
              "Some claim it is a perfectly realistic account of the position of the stars in June 1889.",
              "This, needless to say, is perfectly possible.",
              "But the twisting, spiraling lines have nothing to do with the Northern Lights or the Milky Way or some spiral nebula or other.",
              "Others say that van Gogh was expressing a personal Gethsemane;",

              "This too may be so;",
              "it is possible that premonitions of sufferings to come are articulated in the picture.",
              "But Biblical allegory is present throughout van Gogh's oeuvre, and he had no need of a special motif, least of all a starry sky, with all its associations of Arles and Utopian visions.",
              "Rather, van Gogh was trying to summarize;",
              "and his resume juxtaposed natural, scientific, philosophical and personal elements.",

              "More intensely, perhaps, than ever before, Van Gogh was interested in the material actuality of his motifs as much as in their symbolic dimensions.",
              "There had been hills in Arles too, of course.",

              "Although Van Gogh sold only one painting in his whole life, \"Starry Night\" is an icon of modern art, the Mona Lisa for our time.",

              "4) Physicist Jose Luis Aragon compared the turbulent play of light and dark in such works as \"Starry Night\" to the mathematical expression of turbulence in such natural occurrences as as whirlpools and air streams. He found they matched very closely.",
              "Two other Van Gogh paintings from 1890, WheatField with Crows and Road with Cypress and Star also feature this mathematical parallel.",
              "Aragon suggests that since the artist created these particular artworks during periods of extreme mental agitation, Van Gogh was uniquely able to accurately communication that agitation using precise gradations of luminescence.",
              "5) Analysts of \"Starry Night\" emphasize the symbolism of the stylized cypress tree in the foreground, linking it to death and Van Gogh's eventual suicide.",
              "However, the cypress also represents immortality.",
              "In the painting, the tree reaches into the sky, serving as a direct connection between the earth and the heavens.",
              "The artist may have been making more of a hopeful statement than many credit him with.",
              "This positive interpretation of the cypress symbolism hearkens back to a letter to his brother in which the artist likened death to a train that travels to the stars.",
              "6) In his 2015 book, \"Cosmographics,\" Michael Benson contends that the inspiration behind the distinctive swirls in the sky of Van Gogh's \"Starry Night\" is an 1845 drawing by astronomer William Parsons, Earl of Rosse, of the Whirlpool Galaxy.",
              "7) Research has confirmed that the dominant morning star in the painting is actually Venus, which was in a similar position at the time Van Gogh was working on \"Starry Night,\" and it would have shone brightly, just as Van Gogh painted it.",
              "8) The moon in the painting would not have been in the crescent phase as shown at the time Van Gogh painted \"Starry Night.\"",
              "In reality, it would have been gibbous, or about three-quarters full.",
              "9) Pathologist Paul Wolf postulated in 2001 that the artist's fondness for yellow in paintings like \"Starry Night\" resulted from taking too much digitalis, a treatment in his day for epilepsy.",

              "The Starry Night original painting by Vincent van Gogh, painted in 1889, is estimated to be worth over $100 million.",

              "Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.",

              "Widely regarded as Van Gogh's magnum opus,[4][5] The Starry Night is one of the most recognizable paintings in Western art.",
              "[6][7] In the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear,[8][9] Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889.",
              "[10][11] Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived,[12] allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.",
              "[13] During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum in Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.",
              "[14] During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J.",

              "[1][15][16][L 1] Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory.",
              "The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east,[1][2][17][18] a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times,[citation needed] including The Starry Night.",
              "\"Through the iron-barred window,\" he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, \"I can see an enclosed square of wheat .",

              "[2][L 2] Van Gogh depicted the view at different times of the day and under various weather conditions, such as the sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain.",
              "While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper;",
              "eventually, he would base newer variations on previous versions.",
              "The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains.",
              "In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field.",
              "Van Gogh exaggerated their size in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.",

              "Van Gogh made a number of sketches for the painting, of which F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm is typical.",
              "It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside.",
              "In his 9 June letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days.",
              "[19][20][L 3][15] Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889.",
              "[19][L 4] This is F719 Green Wheat Field with Cypress, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted en plein air.",
              "[19] F1548 Wheatfield, Saint-Re\u0301my de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it.",
              "Two days later, Vincent wrote to Theo stating that he had painted \"a starry sky\".",
              "[21][L 1] The Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window.",
              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",
              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",
              "[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse (F1541r) was also a study for the painting.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",
              "When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he did not send.",
              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",
              ".",

              ".",
              "And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big\u2014another failure\u2014and I have had my fill of that.\"",
              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",
              "These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.",
              "[63] Harvard astronomer Charles A.",
              "Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of The Starry Night contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.",
              "C.",
              "L.",
              "A.)",
              ".",
              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",
              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",

              "Starry Night depicts a dreamy interpretation of the artist's asylum room's sweeping view of Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence.",
              "Though Van Gogh revisited this scene in his work on several occasions, \"Starry Night\" is the only nocturnal study of the view.",
              "Thus, in addition to descriptions evident in the myriad of letters he wrote to his brother, Theo, it offers a rare nighttime glimpse into what the artist saw while in isolation.",
              "\"Through the iron-barred window I can make out a square of wheat in an enclosure,\" he wrote in May of 1889, \"above which in the morning I see the sunrise in its glory.\"",
              "An end-of-the-world cataclysm invades Van Gogh's Starry Night, one of apocalypse filled with melting aerolites and comets adrift.",
              "One has the impression that the artist has expelled his inner conflict onto a canvas.",
              "Everything here is brewed in a huge cosmic fusion.",

              "The artist is looking down on a village from an imaginary viewpoint.",
              "It is framed by his newly-discovered motifs: at left a cypress towers skywards, at right a group of olive trees cluster into the cloud, and against the horizon run the undulating waves of the Alpilles.",
              "Van Gogh's treatment of his motifs prompts associations with fire, mist and the sea,and the elemental power of the natural scene combines with the intangible cosmic drama of the stars.",
              "The eternal natural universe cradles the human settlement idyllically, yet also surrounds it menacingly.",
              "The village itself might be anywhere, Saint-Remy or Nuenen recalled in a nocturnal mood.",
              "The church spire seems to be stretching up into the elements, at once an antenna and a lightning conductor, like some kind of provincial Eiffel Tower (the fascination of which was never far from van Gogh's nocturnes).",
              "Van Gogh's mountains and trees (particularly the cypresses) had hardly been discovered but they seemed to crackle with an electric charge.",
              "Confident that he had grasped their natural appearance, van Gogh set out to remake their image in the service of the symbolic.",
              "Together with the firmament, these landscape features are singing the praises of Creation in this painting.",
              "Van Gogh described this night stars painting in his letter to his brother Theo: I have done another landscape with olive trees, and a new study of the 'starry sky'.",

              "But via Delacroixone can express more of Nature and the country, by means of colour and an individual drawing style, than might appear.\"",
              "Van Gogh is making various points here.",
              "First, his synthesis of motifs was his first echo of work with Gauguin since his breakdown.",
              "The night stars scene (this is something that had only just become important to Van Gogh) offers the visual imagination its most distinctive, unique field of activity, since the lack of light requires the compensatory use of visual memory.",
              "Van Gogh used the memory method in his nocturnal scene;",
              "his discovery of the luminous power of darkness was a personal aesthetic discovery and needed no Gauguin as catalyst.",
              "Second, Van Gogh was drawing upon his long-lost model Euge\u0300ne Delacroix again, and the principle of contrast;",
              "once he paused to reflect on what he had achieved in recent weeks he found his attention drawn back to the colourist techniques which he himself had developed so far.",
              "Third, he was searching for the essence of the landscape, its very being - a way of registering its symbolic power, its vitality, its flux and constancy, all in one.",
              "Interpretations of this Van Gogh night stars painting are legion.",
              "Some claim it is a perfectly realistic account of the position of the stars in June 1889.",
              "This, needless to say, is perfectly possible.",
              "But the twisting, spiraling lines have nothing to do with the Northern Lights or the Milky Way or some spiral nebula or other.",
              "Others say that van Gogh was expressing a personal Gethsemane;",
              "they back this up by referring to the discussion of Christ on the Mount of Olives that he was currently engaged in, in his correspondence with Gauguin and Bernard.",
              "This too may be so;",
              "it is possible that premonitions of sufferings to come are articulated in the picture.",
              "But Biblical allegory is present throughout van Gogh's oeuvre, and he had no need of a special motif, least of all a starry sky, with all its associations of Arles and Utopian visions.",
              "Rather, van Gogh was trying to summarize;",
              "and his resume juxtaposed natural, scientific, philosophical and personal elements.",
              "Starry Night is an attempt to express a state of shock, and the cypresses, olive trees and mountains had acted as van Gogh's catalyst.",
              "More intensely, perhaps, than ever before, Van Gogh was interested in the material actuality of his motifs as much as in their symbolic dimensions.",
              "There had been hills in Arles too, of course.",
              "But they entered his panoramic scenes as idyllic touches.",
              "His landscapes included the harvest, passing trains, isolated farmsteads and distant towns;",
              "and the hills were simply one more detail.",
              "In Arles, Van Gogh's dream had been of the harmony of things and of the spatial dimensions in which that harmony could be felt.",
              "None of that remained.",
              "The hills rose up steep and abruptly now, menacing, threatening to drag the lonesome soul down into vertiginous depths.",
              "The Starry Night has risen to the peak of artistic achievements.",
              "Although Van Gogh sold only one painting in his whole life, \"Starry Night\" is an icon of modern art, the Mona Lisa for our time.",
              "As Leonardo da Vinci evoked a Renaissance ideal of serenity and self-control, Van Gogh defined how we see our own age - wracked with solitude and uncertainty.",
              "Since 1941 Starry Night has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.",
              "1) Vincent Van Gogh painted \"Starry Night\" in 1889 from a room in the mental asylum at Saint-Remy where was recovering from mental illness and his ear amputation.",

              "None show the bars on the window of his room.",
              "3) The artist considered \"The Starry Night,\" which one day would rank among his most famous works, to be a failure, according to what he wrote to his brother.",
              "4) Physicist Jose Luis Aragon compared the turbulent play of light and dark in such works as \"Starry Night\" to the mathematical expression of turbulence in such natural occurrences as as whirlpools and air streams. He found they matched very closely.",
              "Two other Van Gogh paintings from 1890, WheatField with Crows and Road with Cypress and Star also feature this mathematical parallel.",
              "Aragon suggests that since the artist created these particular artworks during periods of extreme mental agitation, Van Gogh was uniquely able to accurately communication that agitation using precise gradations of luminescence.",
              "5) Analysts of \"Starry Night\" emphasize the symbolism of the stylized cypress tree in the foreground, linking it to death and Van Gogh's eventual suicide.",
              "However, the cypress also represents immortality.",
              "In the painting, the tree reaches into the sky, serving as a direct connection between the earth and the heavens.",
              "The artist may have been making more of a hopeful statement than many credit him with.",
              "This positive interpretation of the cypress symbolism hearkens back to a letter to his brother in which the artist likened death to a train that travels to the stars.",
              "6) In his 2015 book, \"Cosmographics,\" Michael Benson contends that the inspiration behind the distinctive swirls in the sky of Van Gogh's \"Starry Night\" is an 1845 drawing by astronomer William Parsons, Earl of Rosse, of the Whirlpool Galaxy.",
              "7) Research has confirmed that the dominant morning star in the painting is actually Venus, which was in a similar position at the time Van Gogh was working on \"Starry Night,\" and it would have shone brightly, just as Van Gogh painted it.",
              "8) The moon in the painting would not have been in the crescent phase as shown at the time Van Gogh painted \"Starry Night.\"",
              "In reality, it would have been gibbous, or about three-quarters full.",
              "9) Pathologist Paul Wolf postulated in 2001 that the artist's fondness for yellow in paintings like \"Starry Night\" resulted from taking too much digitalis, a treatment in his day for epilepsy.",

              "The Starry Night (Dutch: De sterrennacht) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh.",
              "Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.",
              "[1][2][3] It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P.",
              "Bliss Bequest.",
              "Widely regarded as Van Gogh's magnum opus,[4][5] The Starry Night is one of the most recognizable paintings in Western art.",
              "[6][7] In the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear,[8][9] Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889.",
              "[10][11] Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived,[12] allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.",
              "[13] During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum in Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.",
              "[14] During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J.",
              "Paul Getty Museum, and the blue self-portrait from September 1889, in the Muse\u0301e d'Orsay.",
              "The Starry Night was painted mid-June by around 18 June, the date he wrote to his brother Theo to say he had a new study of a starry sky.",
              "[1][15][16][L 1] Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory.",
              "The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east,[1][2][17][18] a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times,[citation needed] including The Starry Night.",
              "\"Through the iron-barred window,\" he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, \"I can see an enclosed square of wheat .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory.\"",
              "[2][L 2] Van Gogh depicted the view at different times of the day and under various weather conditions, such as the sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain.",
              "While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper;",
              "eventually, he would base newer variations on previous versions.",
              "The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains.",
              "In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field.",
              "Van Gogh exaggerated their size in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.",
              "One of the first paintings of the view was F611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Re\u0301my, now in Copenhagen.",
              "Van Gogh made a number of sketches for the painting, of which F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm is typical.",
              "It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside.",
              "In his 9 June letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days.",
              "[19][20][L 3][15] Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889.",
              "[19][L 4] This is F719 Green Wheat Field with Cypress, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted en plein air.",
              "[19] F1548 Wheatfield, Saint-Re\u0301my de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it.",
              "Two days later, Vincent wrote to Theo stating that he had painted \"a starry sky\".",
              "[21][L 1] The Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window.",
              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",
              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",
              "[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse (F1541r) was also a study for the painting.",
              "[23] F1548 Wheatfield, Saint-Re\u0301my de Provence, Morgan Library & Museum F719 Green Wheat Field with Cypress, National Gallery Prague F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm, Van Gogh Museum F611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Re\u0301my, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek F1541v Bird's-Eye View of the Village, Van Gogh Museum F1541r Landscape with Cypresses, Van Gogh Museum Despite the large number of letters Van Gogh wrote, he said very little about The Starry Night.",
              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",
              "When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he did not send.",
              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",
              ".",
              ".",
              ".",
              "But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big\u2014another failure\u2014and I have had my fill of that.\"",
              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",
              "These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.",
              "[63] Harvard astronomer Charles A.",
              "Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of The Starry Night contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.",
              "C.",
              "L.",
              "A.)",
              ".",
              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",
              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",
              "Theo's widow Jo became the caretaker of Van Gogh's legacy.",
              "In Paris in 1900 she sold the painting to poet Julien Leclercq.",
              "In 1901 Leclercq sold it to Gauguin's old friend E\u0301mile Schuffenecker.",
              "Jo bought the painting back from Schuffenecker and in 1906 sold it to the Oldenzeel Gallery in Rotterdam.",
              "From 1906 to 1938 it was owned by Georgette P.",
              "van Stolk, of Rotterdam, who sold it to Paul Rosenberg, of Paris and New York.",
              "It was through Rosenberg that the Museum of Modern Art acquired the painting in 1941.",
