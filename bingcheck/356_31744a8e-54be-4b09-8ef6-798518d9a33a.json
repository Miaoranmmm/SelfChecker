    "query": "What is the most significant breakthrough in renewable energy technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we generate and store energy, and what challenges need to be overcome to make this technology viable on a large scale?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Renewable energy technology is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we generate and store energy, and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are also many challenges that need to be overcome to make this technology viable on a large scale.\n\nAccording to the web search results, some of the most significant breakthroughs in renewable energy technology are:\n\n- **Breakthroughs in battery technology**: Batteries are essential for storing the excess energy produced by solar and wind power, which are intermittent and variable sources of electricity. Batteries can also enable electric vehicles and other devices to run on clean energy. However, current batteries are often expensive, heavy, inefficient, and degrade over time. New battery technologies that can store more power, avoid degradation, and weigh less could dramatically reduce the costs and increase the reliability of renewable energy systems[^1^] [^4^].\n- **Small modular nuclear reactors**: Nuclear power is a carbon-free source of electricity that can provide baseload power regardless of weather conditions. However, traditional nuclear power plants are very costly, complex, and risky to build and operate. Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are smaller, simpler, and safer versions of nuclear reactors that can be mass-produced and deployed in various locations. SMRs could offer a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels for powering remote communities, factories, data centers, and campuses[^1^].\n- **Wave energy**: Wave energy is a form of renewable energy that harnesses the power of ocean waves to generate electricity. Wave energy has several advantages over other renewable sources, such as being abundant, predictable, and less affected by seasonal variations. However, wave energy also faces many challenges, such as high costs, environmental impacts, technical difficulties, and grid integration issues. Wave energy could become a viable source of clean electricity if these challenges are addressed through innovation and investment[^3^] [^8^].\n\nThese are just some examples of the breakthroughs in renewable energy technology that could have a significant impact on the global energy system. However, these technologies also face various barriers and challenges that need to be overcome to make them widely available and affordable. Some of these challenges are:\n\n- **Capital costs**: The upfront costs of building and installing renewable energy systems are often higher than those of fossil fuel plants. This can make it harder for renewable energy projects to secure financing and compete in the market. Capital costs can be reduced by improving the efficiency and performance of renewable technologies, scaling up production and deployment, and providing incentives and subsidies[^1^] [^6^].\n- **Siting and transmission**: Renewable energy sources are often located far from the demand centers or in remote areas where the grid infrastructure is inadequate or nonexistent. This can pose challenges for finding suitable sites for renewable energy projects, obtaining permits and approvals, connecting to the grid, and transmitting the power over long distances. Siting and transmission challenges can be overcome by improving the planning and coordination of renewable energy projects, expanding and upgrading the grid infrastructure, and developing smart grid technologies[^1^] [^6^].\n- **Market entry**: Renewable energy sources have to compete with established fossil fuel sources that have lower costs, higher reliability, and greater market share. Fossil fuel sources also benefit from existing policies, regulations, and subsidies that favor them over renewables. Market entry challenges can be overcome by creating a level playing field for renewable energy sources, implementing carbon pricing and emission standards, promoting research and development (R&D), and increasing public awareness and support[^1^] [^6^] [^10^].\n\nThese are some of the main opportunities and challenges of achieving a 100% clean electricity system by 2035. It is a ambitious but achievable goal that would require significant changes in the technology mix, policy framework, market structure, and social behavior of the energy sector[^2^] [^6^]. It would also require collaboration among various stakeholders, such as governments, utilities, developers, investors, consumers, researchers, and environmentalists[^2^].",

              "Renewable energy plays a key role in the journey to net zero carbon emissions, helping to reduce the demand for fossil fuels by providing cleaner sources of energy.",
              "But as the world derives an increasing amount of its electricity from these renewable energy sources, there\u2019s a growing need for technologies that can capture and store it.",
              "Renewable energy generation mainly relies on naturally-occurring factors \u2013 hydroelectric power is dependent on seasonal river flows, solar power on the amount of daylight, wind power on the consistency of the wind \u2013 meaning that the amounts being generated will be intermittent.",
              "Similarly, the demand for energy isn\u2019t constant either, as people generally tend to use different amounts of energy at different times of the day and the year.",
              "So, when the amount of renewable energy being generated is greater than what\u2019s needed, it makes sense to store that excess energy so it can be used at a time when the demand exceeds the generation.",
              "Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy creates clean power without producing greenhouse gases (GHGs) as a waste product.",
              "By storing and using renewable energy, the system as a whole can rely less on energy sourced from the more greenhouse-gas emitting fuels like coal, natural gas or oil.",
              "Find out more about net zero A key benefit of being able to store this energy is that it helps to prevent renewable resources from going to waste.",
              "There are times when the amount of electricity being generated by renewables can exceed the amount that\u2019s needed at the time.",
              "When this happens, some renewable generators may need to curtail their outputs in order to help the system remain \u2018balanced\u2019 \u2013 i.",
              "e. when electricity supply meets demand \u2013 meaning that an opportunity to generate clean electricity has essentially gone to waste.",
              "Energy storage allows these renewable energy resources to continue to generate electricity even if it\u2019s not needed at that particular time, as it can be stored until a later time when it\u2019s needed.",
              "Energy storage technologies work by converting renewable energy to and from another form of energy.",
              "These are some of the different technologies used to store electrical energy that\u2019s produced from renewable sources: Pumped hydroelectric energy storage, or pumped hydro, stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water.",
              "When demand is low, surplus electricity from the grid is used to pump water up into an elevated reservoir.",
              "When demand increases, the water is released to flow down through turbines to a lower reservoir, producing hydroelectric power for the grid as it does so.",
              "Electrochemical batteries store energy by separating positive and negative charges in rechargeable cells.",
              "Different types of electrochemical battery storage technology include: Lithium-ion battery storage Government and developers are investing substantially in the creation of huge lithium-ion batteries to store energy for times when supply outstrips demand.",
              "Lithium battery technologies are diverse to address custom needs for flexibility, modularity, and size, as well as being relatively inexpensive.",
              "However these batteries do degrade over time and present unique fire management challenges.",
              "The world\u2019s largest battery energy storage system so far is Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility in California.",
              "The first 300-megawatt lithium-ion battery \u2013 comprising 4,500 stacked battery racks \u2013 became operational at the facility in January 2021.",
              "Flow battery storageFlow batteries\u2019 cells consist of two charged liquids separated by a membrane.",
              "Surplus electrical energy is used to \u2018reduce\u2019 the liquid charge state of one and \u2018oxidise\u2019 that of the other to efficiently store energy.",
              "The process is then reversed to recover electricity with low loss.",
              "This flowing reduction-oxidation operation \u2013 known as \u2018redox flow\u2019 \u2013 allows the batteries to store large amounts of energy for long durations and be cycled many times without degradation.",
              "However, they do have a relatively large project footprint.",
              "Read more about battery storage While not limited to renewable energy, storing excess energy as heat for the longer term is a huge opportunity for industry, where most of the process heat that\u2019s used in food and drink, textiles or pharmaceuticals comes from the burning of fossil fuels.",
              "Liquifying rock or superheating sand and water mixtures can be used to store thermal energy.",
              "Thermal energy storage technologies include: Liquid-to-air transition energy storage Surplus grid electricity is used to chill ambient air to the point that it liquifies.",
              "This \u2018liquid air\u2019 is then turned back into gas by exposing it to ambient air or using waste heat to harvest electricity from the system.",
              "The expanding gas can then be used to power turbines, creating electricity as needed.",
              "Thermal sand batteries Finnish researchers have developed and installed the world\u2019s first fully working \u2018sand battery\u2019, which can store power for months at a time.",
              "Using low-grade sand, the device is charged up with heat made from cheap electricity from solar or wind.",
              "The sand stores the heat at around 500\u00b0C, which can then warm homes in winter when energy is more expensive.",
              "This type of energy storage converts the potential energy of highly compressed gases, elevated heavy masses or rapidly rotating kinetic equipment.",
              "Different types of mechanical energy storage technology include: Compressed air energy storage Compressed air energy storage has been around since the 1870s as an option to deliver energy to cities and industries on demand.",
              "The process involves using surplus electricity to compress air, which can then be decompressed and passed through a turbine to generate electricity when needed.",
              "This type of storage system can be used in conjunction with a wind farm, pulling in air and creating a high-pressure system in a series of enormous underground chambers.",
              "When wind speeds slow down or demand for electricity increases, the pressurised air is discharged to power turbines or generators.",
              "Gravity storageA \u2018gravity battery\u2019 works by using excess electrical energy from the grid to raise a mass, such as a block of concrete, generating gravitational potential energy.",
              "When electrical energy is required, the mass is lowered, converting this potential energy into power through an electric generator.",
              "Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is a type of gravity storage, since the water is released from a higher elevation to produce energy.",
              "Flywheel energy storage Flywheel energy storage devices turn surplus electrical energy into kinetic energy in the form of heavy high-velocity spinning wheels.",
              "To avoid energy losses, the wheels are kept in a frictionless vacuum by a magnetic field, allowing the spinning to be managed in a way that creates electricity when required.",
              "This technology has several advantages over conventional energy storage systems, such as direct electrical generation through contactless induction, little maintenance, long life, and few environmental effects.",
              "Pumped heat electrical storage Pumped heat storage uses surplus electricity to power a heat pump that transports heat from a \u2018cold store\u2019 to a \u2018hot store\u2019 - similar to how a refrigerator works.",
              "The heat pump can then be switched to recover the energy, taking it from the hot store and placing it in the cold store.",
              "This produces mechanical work, which is used to power a generator.",
              "One of the benefits of this system is that it reacts considerably faster than other storage systems, taking action within minutes.",
              "Hydrogen electrolysis produces hydrogen gas by passing surplus electrical current through a chemical solution.",
              "This hydrogen gas is then compressed to be stored in underground tanks.",
              "When needed, this process can be reversed to produce electricity from the stored hydrogen.",
              "Hydrogen can be physically stored as either a gas or liquid and even adhered directly to solids.",
              "As a gas, hydrogen storage requires high-pressure tanks, while liquid hydrogen requires storage at cryogenic temperatures to prevent it boiling back into a gas.",
              "Hydrogen may also be stored on the surface of solid materials (known as adsorption), or within them (known as absorption).",
              "Underground hydrogen storage technology is also being developed that can re-infuse the geology of the earth to safely store large volumes of green hydrogen.",

              "The goal is even cheaper batteries that will provide cheap storage for the grid and allow EVs to travel far greater distances on a charge.",
              "At the same time, concerns about supplies of key battery materials like cobalt and lithium are pushing a search for alternatives to the standard lithium-ion chemistry.",
              "In the midst of the soaring demand for EVs and renewable power and an explosion in battery development, one thing is certain: batteries will play a key role in the transition to renewable energy.",

              "Some dramatically different approaches to EV batteries could see progress in 2023, though they will likely take longer to make a commercial impact.",
              "One advance to keep an eye on this year is in so-called solid-state batteries.",
              "Lithium-ion batteries and related chemistries use a liquid electrolyte that shuttles charge around;",

              "This swap unlocks possibilities that pack more energy into a smaller space, potentially improving the range of electric vehicles.",
              "Solid-state batteries could also move charge around faster, meaning shorter charging times.",
              "And because some solvents used in electrolytes can be flammable, proponents of solid-state batteries say they improve safety by cutting fire risk.",
              "A new type of battery could finally make electric cars as convenient and cheap as gas ones.",
              "Solid-state batteries can use a wide range of chemistries, but a leading candidate for commercialization uses lithium metal.",
              "Quantumscape, for one, is focused on that technology and raised hundreds of millions in funding before going public in 2020.",
              "The company has a deal with Volkswagen that could put its batteries in cars by 2025.",
              "But completely reinventing batteries has proved difficult, and lithium-metal batteries have seen concerns about degradation over time, as well as manufacturing challenges.",
              "Quantumscape announced in late December it had delivered samples to automotive partners for testing, a significant milestone on the road to getting solid-state batteries into cars.",
              "Other solid-state-battery players, like Solid Power, are also working to build and test their batteries.",
              "But while they could reach major milestones this year as well, their batteries won\u2019t make it into vehicles on the road in 2023.",
              "Solid-state batteries aren\u2019t the only new technology to watch out for.",
              "Sodium-ion batteries also swerve sharply from lithium-ion chemistries common today.",
              "These batteries have a design similar to that of lithium-ion batteries, including a liquid electrolyte, but instead of relying on lithium, they use sodium as the main chemical ingredient.",
              "Chinese battery giant CATL reportedly plans to begin mass-producing them in 2023.",
              "Sodium-ion batteries may not improve performance, but they could cut costs because they rely on cheaper, more widely available materials than lithium-ion chemistries do.",
              "But it\u2019s not clear whether these batteries will be able to meet needs for EV range and charging time, which is why several companies going after the technology, like US-based Natron, are targeting less demanding applications to start, like stationary storage or micromobility devices such as e-bikes and scooters.",
              "Today, the market for batteries aimed at stationary grid storage is small\u2014about one-tenth the size of the market for EV batteries, according to Yayoi Sekine, head of energy storage at energy research firm BloombergNEF.",
              "But demand for electricity storage is growing as more renewable power is installed, since major renewable power sources like wind and solar are variable, and batteries can help store energy for when it\u2019s needed.",
              "Lithium-ion batteries aren\u2019t ideal for stationary storage, even though they\u2019re commonly used for it today.",
              "While batteries for EVs are getting smaller, lighter, and faster, the primary goal for stationary storage is to cut costs.",
              "Size and weight don\u2019t matter as much for grid storage, which means different chemistries will likely win out.",
              "One rising star in stationary storage is iron, and two players could see progress in the coming year.",
              "Form Energy is developing an iron-air battery that uses a water-based electrolyte and basically stores energy using reversible rusting.",
              "The company recently announced a $760 million manufacturing facility in Weirton, West Virginia, scheduled to begin construction in 2023.",
              "Another company, ESS, is building a different type of iron battery that employs similar chemistry;",
              "it has begun manufacturing at its headquarters in Wilsonville, Oregon.",
              "Lithium-ion batteries keep getting better and cheaper, but researchers are tweaking the technology further to eke out greater performance and lower costs.",
              "Some of the motivation comes from the price volatility of battery materials, which could drive companies to change chemistries.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s a cost game,\u201d Sekine says.",
              "Cathodes are typically one of the most expensive parts of a battery, and a type of cathode called NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) is the dominant variety in EV batteries today.",
              "But those three elements, in addition to lithium, are expensive, so cutting some or all of them could help decrease costs.",
              "This year could be a breakout year for one alternative: lithium iron phosphate (LFP), a low-cost cathode material sometimes used for lithium-ion batteries.",
              "Aggressive new US policies will be put to the test in 2023.",
              "They could ultimately fragment the global semiconductor industry.",
              "Recent improvements in LFP chemistry and manufacturing have helped boost the performance of these batteries, and companies are moving to adopt the technology: LFP market share is growing quickly, from about 10% of the global EV market in 2018 to about 40% in 2022.",
              "Tesla is already using LFP batteries in some vehicles, and automakers like Ford and Volkswagen announced that they plan to start offering some EV models with the chemistry too.",
              "Though battery research tends to focus on cathode chemistries, anodes are also in line to get a makeover.",
              "Most anodes in lithium-ion batteries today, whatever their cathode makeup, use graphite to hold the lithium ions.",
              "But alternatives like silicon could help increase energy density and speed up charging.",
              "Silicon anodes have been the subject of research for years, but historically they haven\u2019t had a long enough lifetime to last in products.",
              "Now though, companies are starting to expand production of the materials.",
              "In 2021, startup Sila began producing silicon anodes for batteries in a wearable fitness device.",

              "The IRA will provide loans and grants to battery makers in the US, boosting capacity.",
              "In addition, EV tax credits in the law incentivize automakers to source battery materials in the US or from its free-trade partners and manufacture batteries in North America.",
              "Because of both the IRA\u2019s funding and the EV tax credit restrictions, automakers will continue announcing new manufacturing capacity in the US and finding new ways to source materials.",

              "One of the benefits of SMRs is being able to put power generation closer to the source of need, on-site or within a reasonable distance,\u201d Howard told Data Center Knowledge in an interview.",
              "The key benefit for data center operators is that SMRs will generate reliable, carbon-free electricity, said Jay Dietrich, the Uptime Institute\u2019s research director of sustainability.",
              "Nuclear is a clean energy source that can augment the use of renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, to help data centers become more sustainable.",
              "The issue is renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power generation, can be seasonal and intermittent, he said.",
              "\u201cThere is a struggle to get carbon-free energy that\u2019s reliable.",
              "Nuclear does two things for you: one is reliable power and the second is it\u2019s carbon free, so you can meet your carbon-free and net zero objectives,\u201d Dietrich said.",
              "While SMRs offer many potential benefits to the data center industry, it will take time for the market to develop.",
              "It\u2019s about a 10-year journey with many hurdles to clear, from getting manufacturing ramped up, receiving design permits and site approvals, and gaining permission to hook into the grid if they are not specifically built on-site with data centers, Dietrich said.",
              "The cost to build the initial nuclear plants using SMRs may be high, but over time, the costs will go down, Lohse from INL said.",
              "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone expects the first couple of builds to be the cheapest, but when you get the supply chain going, the cost curve will go down and you will get economies of scale,\u201d he said.",
              "In fact, in a setback to the emerging market, NuScale\u2019s plan to launch a six-reactor, 462 MW-project with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems collapsed in early November when several towns withdrew from the project after costs rose.",
              "Another challenge is that SMRs will still produce some nuclear waste, even if it\u2019s much less than large, traditional nuclear plants, Lohse said.",
              "Some SMR companies are looking at using recycled nuclear waste to minimize waste, he added.",
              "For example, Oklo, which plans to go live with a commercial reactor to power INL in 2027, plans to build a full-scale nuclear fuel recycling facility and use recycled nuclear fuel for its SMRs, Gitt said.",
              "Another adoption challenge is getting community buy-in to build small nuclear reactors in both rural and urban locations.",
              "SMR vendors and developers could face some pushback, so they must be prepared to demonstrate that the nuclear technology is safe and offers economic benefits, analysts said.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s a major communication effort and a lot of listening and work to address concerns positively,\u201d Dietrich said.",
              "The emerging SMR market has gained momentum in recent years.",
              "It\u2019s a confluence of factors, from private companies making technological advances, increased government funding, and research support from national labs to the NRC streamlining its process for approvals, Howard said.",
              "At the policy level, federal, state, and local governments are paying more attention to the need for power generation, he said.",
              "Dietrich from the Uptime Institute agrees, saying utilities, large data center operators, regulators, state legislatures, climate activists and others are realizing that the grid cannot remain viable without dispatchable, baseload carbon-free electricity generation.",
              "The only demonstrated technology available to fill that niche is nuclear, he said.",
              "\u201cYou\u2019ve seen a shift from, \u2018there\u2019s no way we should use nuclear,\u2019 to a pretty strong voice that nuclear has to play a part,\u201d Dietrich says.",
              "\u201cWith that realization, commercial and industrial customers view nuclear generation and SMRs as an important piece of the electrical energy infrastructure.",
              "\u201d The SMR market will develop step-by-step.",
              "First, there will be permitting efforts and demonstration projects.",
              "Then the first units will go in and begin operation, and as people get familiar with the technology, there will be more willingness by communities to support SMR adoption, Dietrich says.",
              "SMR vendors can pursue different business models, Lohse said.",
              "They can sell SMRs to utilities, who in turn would own and operate the nuclear plants to provide power to data centers and other industries.",
              "They could also become their own power producer and sell the power to data centers themselves, he said.",
              "\u201cDo they want to pair it with other renewables and be grid connected, or simply colocate it next to data centers in one spot and be an island?",
              "It\u2019s a blank canvas for these companies to figure out what business model they want,\u201d Lohse said.",
              "Data centers most likely will prefer a third-party to operate the SMR-powered plants rather than own and operate SMRs themselves, Lohse added.",
              "Overall, nuclear power is part of the equation for data centers to become fully powered by carbon-free energy, but it will take time, Dietrich says.",
              "However, now is the time for data center operators to take small nuclear reactors into account as they plan future data centers, Howard said.",
              "\u201cThe time to start paying attention is now because large infrastructure projects, including data centers, typically have a fairly long planning cycle,\u201d Howard said.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s important that people in planning positions for data center developments understand where the SMR industry is at and look five, six or seven years down the road, so they understand where power is going to be and how that might affect their site selections.",

              "Their generation capacity, between 200 MWe and 400 MWe, is similar to that of a typical coal fired plant, therefore these SMRs would also be suited to existing grid connections.",

              "\u201cNuclear energy is uniquely positioned to redirect workers from the retired fossil fuel industry to the nuclear power plant, preserving steady power generation,\u201d said Aline des Cloizeaux, Director of the IAEA Division of Nuclear Power.",

              "That's where nuclear energy via small modular reactors (SMRs) could come in.",
              "Unlike standard nuclear facilities that produce gigawatts of power, SMRs typically generate 300-500 megawatts (MW) of electric power, though some produce less than 100MW.",
              "Any mention of nuclear reactors tends to bring concerns about disasters such as Chornobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, but the analysts write that SMRs pose far less risk due to their scale, simple design, and the inherent safety characteristics of the reactor.",
              "They also rely on natural circulation, convection, gravity, and self-pressurization.",
              "Additionally, technology similar to SMR is used in 83 nuclear-powered US Navy ships, including 72 submarines, 10 aircraft carriers, and one research vessel, many located adjacent to large population centers, and there has never been a nuclear power incident in the Navy's history.",
              "But despite their benefits, nuclear waste remains a big problem with SMRs, with spent fuel material taking anything from three decades up to 24,000 years to reach safe radiation levels.",
              "However, unlike conventional nuclear power plants that require refueling every year or two, SMR vendors are aiming for every three to seven years---some designs are estimated to operate for 40 years without refueling.",
              "It's pointed out that nuclear subs only require refueling every 10 or more years, with new cores designed to last 30 to 40 years.",

              "Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2021, published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) today, shows that almost two-thirds or 163 gigawatts (GW) of newly installed renewable power in 2021 had lower costs than the world\u2019s cheapest coal-fired option in the G20.",
              "IRENA estimates that, given the current high fossil fuel prices, the renewable power added in 2021 saves around USD 55 billion from global energy generation costs in 2022.",

              "High coal and fossil gas prices in 2021 and 2022 will also profoundly deteriorate the competitiveness of fossil fuels and make solar and wind even more attractive.",

              "The European example shows that fuel and CO2 costs for existing gas plants might average four to six times more in 2022 than the lifetime cost of new solar PV and onshore wind commissioned in 2021.",
              "Between January and May 2022, the generation of solar and wind power may have saved Europe fossil fuel imports in the magnitude of no less than USD 50 billion, predominantly fossil gas.",
              "As to supply chains, IRENA\u2019s data suggests that not all materials cost increases have been passed through into equipment prices and project costs yet.",
              "If material costs remain elevated, the price pressures in 2022 will be more pronounced.",

              "Overall, NREL finds multiple pathways to 100% clean electricity by 2035 that would produce significant benefits, but the exact technology mix and costs will be determined by research and development (R&D), manufacturing, and infrastructure investment decisions over the next decade.",

              "Unlike other NREL studies, the 2035 study scenarios consider many new factors: a 2035 full decarbonization timeframe, higher levels of electrification and an associated increase in electricity demand, increased electricity demand from carbon dioxide removal technologies and clean fuels production, higher reliance on existing commercial renewable energy generation technologies, and greater diversity of seasonal storage solutions.",
              "For each scenario, NREL modeled the least-cost generation, energy storage, and transmission investment portfolio to maintain safe and reliable power during all hours of the year.",

              "As modeled, wind and solar energy provide 60%\u201380% of generation in the least-cost electricity mix in 2035, and the overall generation capacity grows to roughly three times the 2020 level by 2035\u2014including a combined 2 terawatts of wind and solar.",
              "To achieve those levels would require an additional 40\u201390 gigawatts of solar on the grid per year and 70\u2013150 gigawatts of wind per year by the end of this decade under this modeled scenario.",
              "That's more than four times the current annual deployment levels for each technology.",

              "As modeled, the total transmission capacity in 2035 is one to almost three times today's capacity, which would require between 1,400 and 10,100 miles of new high-capacity lines per year, assuming new construction starts in 2026.",
              "Overall, NREL finds in all modeled scenarios that the health and climate benefits associated with fewer emissions exceed the power system costs to get to 100% clean electricity.",
              "To decarbonize the grid by 2035, the total additional power system costs between 2023 and 2035 range across scenarios from $330 billion to $740 billion.",
              "The scenarios with the highest cost have restrictions on new transmission and other infrastructure development.",
              "In the scenario with the highest cost, the amount of wind that can be delivered to population centers is constrained and more storage and nuclear generation are deployed.",
              "However, in all scenarios there is substantial reduction in fossil fuels used to produce electricity.",
              "As a result of the improved air quality, up to 130,000 premature deaths are avoided in the coming decades, which could save $390 billion to $400 billion\u2014enough to exceed the cost to decarbonize the electric grid.",

              "\"The benefits of a zero-carbon grid outweigh the costs in each of the more than 100 scenarios modeled in this study, and accelerated cost declines for renewable and clean energy technologies could lead to even larger benefits.\"",
              "Reduced technology costs alone cannot achieve the transformational change outlined in the study.",
              "NREL also identifies four key challenges that must be addressed in the next decade, through further research and other societal efforts, to enable full power sector decarbonization.",
              "Electrification of some end-use energy services in the buildings, transportation, and industrial sectors is a key strategy for decarbonizing those sectors.",
              "Increased electrification, in turn, increases overall electricity demand and the scale of the power system that needs to be decarbonized.",
              "Enabling more efficient use of electricity in the buildings, transportation, and industrial sectors could enable a cost-effective transition.",
              "This includes siting and interconnecting new renewable and storage plants at a rate three to six times greater than recent levels, which would set the stage for doubling or tripling the capacity of the transmission system, upgrading the distribution system, building new pipelines and storage for hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and/or deploying nuclear and carbon management technologies.",
              "The Inflation Reduction Act could jumpstart the deployment needed by making it more cost-effective.",
              "The unprecedented deployment rates require a corresponding growth in raw materials, manufacturing facilities, and a trained workforce throughout clean energy supply chains.",

              "Still, getting from a 90% clean grid to full decarbonization could be accelerated by developing large-scale, commercialized deployment solutions for clean hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels, advanced nuclear, price-responsive demand response, carbon capture and storage, direct air capture, and advanced grid controls.",
              "These areas are ripe for continued R&D.",

              "Photo: ED JONES/AFP via Getty Images Brief by Allegra Dawes Cy McGeady and Joseph Majkut Published May 31, 2023 The global voluntary carbon market, and its supporting industry ecosystem, has grown substantially from its origins in the early 1990s.",
              "Despite this growth, voluntary markets have been hampered by reputational and functional concerns about offset quality and the space remains fragmented.",
              "With no long-term regulatory obligations or pricing signals on carbon, firms are left to chart their net-zero paths with little guidance or policy vision.",
              "The question is whether organized voluntary carbon markets can help resolve these challenges by creating credible incentives for emissions reductions.",
              "This brief reviews recent initiatives aimed at creating more functional, transparent, and effective carbon marketplaces.",
              "In many cases, there is a growing intersection between government and private sector activity in voluntary markets.",
              "These novel initiatives demonstrate how market design choices imply different goals for voluntary markets.",
              "These models suggest new ways for governments to support the legitimacy and success of voluntary markets.",
              "This brief considers how these market approaches could be best suited to support U.",
              "S.",
              "policy and trade strategies.",
              "It is important to be clear on the terminology used in this brief.",
              "The phrase \u201cvoluntary carbon market\u201d can be used in various ways.",
              "The first usage of the term refers to the global voluntary carbon market in its broadest conception.",
              "This is the noncentralized, fragmented, and emergent global industry ecosystem.",
              "Private buyers and sellers exchange carbon credits that represent one ton of greenhouse gas avoided or removed, though the exact specification of these credits is likewise unregulated and non-standardized.",
              "Credits are generated by diverse types of projects globally and certified by a variety of independent organizations.",
              "Buyers purchase credits to offset emissions and meet internally set voluntary goals or to sell forward to other end \u201cusers\u201d of the credit.",
              "A second sense of the term, and the primary focus of this brief, concerns an emerging class of voluntary carbon markets that are demarcated from the global marketplace;",
              "these are organized voluntary carbon market initiatives.",
              "These markets share many of the basic principles and in some cases share the same credits with the broader global market, but they represent attempts by commercial and governmental bodies to create regulated centralized marketplaces that cover their respective jurisdictions, industries, or interests.",
              "To manage increasing demand for carbon credits, private firms and organizations have developed standards and maintained credit registries.",
              "Today these are well-established players such as the American Carbon Registry (ACR), the Climate Action Reserve (CAR), the Gold Standard (GS), and the Verified Carbon Standard.",
              "These agencies regulate the \u201csupply\u201d side of the market;",
              "they define project standards, verify compliance, and host registries that regulate the minting and retirement of credits.",
              "It is important to note that these remain nongovernmental and private;",
              "they earn revenue from the offsets they recognize.",
              "While the current voluntary market ecosystem is fragmented and dominated by decentralized, broker mediated, over-the-counter trades, there have been previous attempts to organize and regulate the space.",
              "Established in 2003, the Chicago Carbon Exchange (CCX) was an early U.",
              "S.",
              "-based attempt to create a structured carbon market paired with a voluntary greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction program.",
              "Notably, several major blue-chip industrial firms joined at the outset, including American Electric Power (AEP), Ford, DuPont, and others.",
              "The CCX operated on a cap-and-trade model, setting baseline emissions for each member, requiring a yearly emission reduction of 1 percent, and issuing annual allowances to match these targets.",
              "Firms that reduced by more than 1 percent could bank or sell their surplus allowances.",
              "The CCX connected this closed-emissions scheme to outside participation by allowing carbon offsets produced by third parties (primarily agricultural firms in the Midwest) to be traded on the exchange.",
              "Industrials could use these offsets to meet emissions targets.",
              "In 2010, the CCX was discontinued following a sustained period in which the carbon price traded at 5 cents and the exchange witnessed essentially zero activity.",
              "Market design flaws are an important part of this eventual failure.",
              "Notably, a flooding of the market by offsets dramatically unbalanced supply and demand.",
              "Meanwhile, demand was fixed according to emissions reduction targets from participating companies, penalties for failure to meet targets were negligible, and the CCX failed to attract substantial and growing participation from industry.",
              "However, politics was arguably the central cause of the CCX\u2019s demise.",
              "It was born in a certain political moment in which, following the success of the acid rain cap-and-trade program, the recently negotiated Kyoto Protocol, and European movement toward what would become the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), a broad U.",
              "S.",
              "government-imposed emissions trading scheme seemed to be in the imminent future.",
              "With the 2009 failure of a congressional \u201ccap and trade\u201d bill, the concept subsequently underwent political toxification, and thus industry interest in using a voluntary scheme to get ahead of regulatory onset was dead.",
              "While the CCX was short-lived and failed to result in an economy-wide price on carbon, it reflected an attempt to create a marketplace of participating companies that, while not legally obligated by the government to invest in emissions reductions, made binding commitments to do so.",
              "As net-zero commitments from companies have grown, establishing a marketplace mechanism that enables companies to access a financial framework to actualize commitments will be critical.",
              "Additionally, improving the integrity of voluntary claims and the effectiveness of trade will require more centralized market infrastructure.",
              "Since the collapse of the CCX, trade has rebounded and private demand for carbon credits has grown tremendously.",
              "In 2021, its market value reached nearly $2 billion, marking impressive growth from less than $200 million just five years prior.",
              "The 2016 Paris Climate Agreement has created new opportunities for voluntary carbon markets.",
              "Article 6 of the agreement raises the possibility of countries using carbon offsets toward their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).",
              "This development cemented official recognition of the offset model and the value of voluntary markets and pointed toward a future in which they could achieve national and international standardization.",
              "The convergence between private carbon markets and governments, as well as the need to scale the trade of high-quality credits, has resulted in a number of new market initiatives.",
              "In recent years, a number of market initiatives have emerged from both the private and public sectors seeking to improve the integrity and functionality of voluntary carbon markets.",
              "These range from the creation of trade infrastructure to new forms of project certification.",
              "While voluntary carbon markets and compliance markets remain distinct, there is an increasing level of overlap between the two.",
              "Multiple initiates have created a hybrid model for voluntary markets in which the government plays a more active role in defining and regulating companies\u2019 voluntary trade of carbon credits.",
              "The five voluntary initiatives below represent some of the diversity within the sector today.",
              "Conceptually, voluntary carbon markets are seen as a critical tool for mobilizing finance for climate mitigation.",
              "However, it can be difficult to clearly identify what type of climate mitigation voluntary arrangements are funding.",
              "One significant challenge for voluntary markets is a growing bifurcation between credit types.",
              "The global voluntary carbon market has historically been dominated by avoidance credits.",
              "These certify projects that avoid emissions that otherwise would have occurred.",
              "Examples include preventing deforestation or building renewable energy where fossil fuel-fired resources would have been built.",
              "Challenging these are a new class of removal credits that certify direct removal and sequestration of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
              "Examples here are direct air capture, biochar production, and reforestation programs. These technologies are immature and reforestation programs are more difficult to undertake.",
              "Therefore, these removal credits are scarce relative to avoidance credits.",
              "Further, the emissions reduction contribution is considered more scientifically rigorous relative to avoidance credits.",
              "Increasing the supply of carbon removal credits is seen as a critical component in meeting net-zero goals.",
              "These factors combine to allow removal credits to command a premium from buyers and trade at many multiples of avoidance credits.",
              "This divide reflects a key theme: voluntary carbon markets are an extremely flexible financing model.",
              "Financial flows within voluntary markets can be applied to multiple challenges, including carbon mitigation and financing the energy transition.",
              "However, these different challenges and problems require different markets, models, and products to achieve a certain priority efficiently.",
              "In each of the reviewed voluntary initiatives above, carbon crediting and voluntary trade between market participants is organized around a variety of overlapping but distinct goals.",
              "These goals involve different actors and jurisdictions that help inform market design.",
              "This brief identifies four separate goals that can be pursued through voluntary arrangements: These goals are not mutually exclusive.",
              "However, targeting different goals through the use of carbon offsetting can result in very different market configurations and conceptions for the role of government, if any, in voluntary carbon markets.",
              "The design of a voluntary carbon market and the role of government in such an initiative reflects the priorities of the market.",
              "For instance, while the GX League would likely serve to channel financing for emissions reduction efforts, the driving focus for the initiative and the participating companies is to reduce emissions across industries in Japan.",
              "On the other hand, the ETA is primarily focused on bridging the gap between climate ambition globally and the financial investment available to achieve this ambition;",
              "it will primarily act to channel capital toward decarbonizing the power sectors of developing economies.",
              "Designing a voluntary carbon market initiative should include recognition and articulation of the guiding priorities and the specific challenges in carbon mitigation that the initiative hopes to address.",
              "In the reviewed market initiatives, governments play different roles in designing and regulating the trade of carbon credits.",
              "The LSE market designation has a relatively limited role for the government.",
              "The initiative increases overall transparency and reporting requirements for project investors and shareholders interested in participating in the market.",
              "On the other hand, the GX League is a government-originated initiative in which the concept and functioning of the market stem from the government\u2019s overarching green transformation policies.",
              "While the main priorities of these initiatives differ, governments can help to set objectives and articulate a narrower vision for a particular voluntary initiative.",
              "Designing a voluntary carbon market initiative should include recognition and articulation of the guiding priorities and the specific challenges in carbon mitigation that the initiative hopes to address.",
              "In the reviewed market initiatives, governments play different roles in designing and regulating the trade of carbon credits.",
              "Article 6 of the Paris Climate Agreement looms large over the entire global voluntary carbon market ecosystem, and particularly over the potential role of voluntary markets in achieving NDCs.",
              "When approved in 2016, Article 6 provided significant momentum for voluntary markets and the carbon offset model by confirming their role in achieving global emissions reduction targets.",
              "Article 6 is primarily focused on country-to-country transfers of carbon credits.",
              "These credits can then be used to meet NDCs.",
              "Implementation of Article 6 requires establishing standards for certifying credits, a registry for transfers, and a market for facilitating such transfers.",
              "These mechanisms exist in many forms across the globe at various institutional and jurisdictional levels.",
              "By creating a global set of standards accepted by all countries, Article 6 has the potential to consolidate the highly fractured global market that exists today.",
              "Industry observers argue that such a result would accelerate the growth of carbon markets, unlock new financing, and speed deployment of projects that lead to emissions reductions.",
              "However, Article 6 remains mired in negotiations over details of its implementation.",
              "Talks at COP27 in November 2022 failed to deliver conclusive results.",
              "In fact, uncertainty over Article 6 accounting and interaction with voluntary markets has led some developing countries to ban exports of carbon credits.",
              "Developing countries are concerned that export of carbon credits, and the \u201ccorresponding adjustment\u201d to their national emissions accounting, will hurt their own NDCs.",
              "This ongoing uncertainty perhaps best explains why none of the reviewed initiatives are explicitly tied to Article 6 mechanisms. Conversely, all of these initiatives are implicitly linked to Article 6;",
              "potentially any of the credits covered by these markets could one day be accounted for by the producing or purchasing country in their NDC calculations.",
              "Emissions compliance markets and voluntary carbon markets are traditionally understood as separate, mutually exclusive approaches to achieving emissions reductions.",
              "Compliance markets are defined by the imposition of declining emissions limits, which in the terminology of the voluntary carbon markets can be understood as strict demand-side regulation;",
              "with no outside sources of emissions reductions, the covered sector must invest in internal emissions reductions projects.",
              "Voluntary carbon markets have been defined by their ability to act as a financing vehicle\u2014a way to monetize environmental protection and emissions reduction projects that are beyond the scope of a compliance market.",
              "Though this distinction remains applicable to many systems, the boundaries between the two approaches are blurring.",
              "New initiatives combine elements of both models and, with a supporting role from government, form a hybrid mode that might be described as voluntary carbon emissions trading.",
              "The CCX was an early example of this hybrid model, and the Japanese GX League is the newest iteration.",
              "In both, industrial participants commit to voluntary emissions reductions.",
              "Critically, the market is structured such that these commitments primarily incent investment into decarbonization projects within their covered supply chains.",
              "In both cases, however, traditional carbon offsets are allowed into the trading scheme and traded at parity with allowance units.",
              "It is critical to rightsize this external supply of emissions reductions.",
              "Excessive external supply can drown the market, drive down prices, and undercut the incentive to invest in covered emissions reductions.",
              "This occurred in the CCX and drove market prices down to essentially $0 and undermined confidence in the entire initiative.",
              "In any case, this regulatory authority \u201cat the gate\u201d of the marketplace can address the supply-side issues that plague voluntary carbon markets.",
              "One way to limit supply is to set very high credit quality standards.",
              "Another regulatory approach might target a certain class of credits that the governing agreement seeks to target.",

              "Though this distinction remains applicable to many systems, the boundaries between the two approaches are blurring.",
              "Likewise, linking voluntary carbon markets to an organized demand-side emissions reduction scheme addresses many of the greenwashing accusations targeted at buyers of carbon credits.",
              "This is also a major issue hampering the growth of voluntary markets.",
              "These concerns have caused the Australian voluntary carbon market, which started with no demand-side regulation, to introduce the Safeguard Mechanism, inching the Australian market toward the shape of the GX League.",
              "In short, the hybrid model addresses both supply- and demand-side issues facing the voluntary carbon market model.",
              "Scale and coverage are major considerations because markets thrive with volume.",
              "However, voluntary markets may be able to start small and incrementally scale, with companies voluntarily joining the marketplace one by one.",
              "Cross-sectoral participation may be less important at the outset than unanimous intra-sectoral participation.",
              "Sectors can then be added incrementally over time.",

              "Sector-by-sector growth creates an opportunity to craft and negotiate emissions targets on a sectoral basis, accounting for sectoral emissions profiles, rather than uniform targets across the market.",
              "The use of external supply could also be negotiated on a sector-by-sector basis according to the relative difficulty of abatement.",
              "The GX League\u2019s scale, incorporating over 600 companies, representing nearly 40 percent of Japan\u2019s total emissions, is a key aspect to the potential success of the initiative.",
              "The role of government in a voluntary emissions trading scheme is an evolving question.",
              "At a high level, government recognition and incorporation of the market into national decarbonization strategies can resolve uncertainty about the persistence of the market.",
              "If firms are to make significant voluntary investments predicated on price signals generated by a market, they need confidence that the market will persist over time.",
              "In Japan, the GX League is a key component of the government\u2019s overarching transition strategy and has been introduced in conjunction with a phased compliance price on carbon.",
