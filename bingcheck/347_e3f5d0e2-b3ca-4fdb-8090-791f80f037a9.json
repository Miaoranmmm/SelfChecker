    "query": "What is the history and cultural significance behind the traditional Korean martial art of Taekkyeon, and how has it evolved over time to become a revered aspect of Korean culture and identity?",
    "response": "Taekkyeon is a traditional Korean martial art that dates back to ancient times. It is characterized by fluid, rhythmic dance-like movements that use both hands and feet to strike, trip, or throw the opponent. Taekkyeon is also a sport that promotes community integration, public health, and consideration for others[^1^] [^2^].\n\nAccording to Wikipedia[^1^], Taekkyeon is often considered as the oldest martial discipline of Korea and a living link to Korea's past. It has provided historical references for modern Korean martial arts such as Taekwondo and Hapkido. Taekkyeon was almost wiped out during the Japanese Occupation (1910-1945), before being rediscovered after the Korean War (1950-1953). In 1983, Taekkyeon was designated as Important Intangible Cultural Asset No. 76 by the Korean government. In 2011, it was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO[^2^].\n\nTaekkyeon has evolved over time to adapt to different historical and social contexts. According to Taekwondo Times[^3^], Taekkyeon was practiced by the ruling classes before the 6th century, and became very popular among the common people from the 9th to 12th century. It was also used as a military training method during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897). During the Japanese Occupation, Taekkyeon was suppressed and almost disappeared. After the Korean War, some surviving masters revived Taekkyeon and taught it to younger generations. Today, Taekkyeon is practiced by many people as a daily activity, a sport, or a cultural heritage[^3^].",

              "As such, it has provided historical references for modern Korean martial arts and is often considered as the oldest martial discipline of Korea.",
              "[1] It was almost wiped out during the Japanese Occupation, before being rediscovered after the Korean War.",
              "It has influenced the name and conceptualization of Taekwondo.",
              "[2] Taekkyon was the first martial art enlisted in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.",
              "It is also the 76th Intangible Cultural Property of South Korea.",
              "[1][3][4] Historical records regarding Taekkyon are scant and ambiguous.",
              "The term is described as a Martial art, and probably is descended from earlier dynasties' Subak or as a folk game.",
              "The earliest written source of the term appears during the reign of King Jeongjo (1776\u20131800) of the Joseon Dynasty, in the book Jaemulbo (also Manmulbo), which included an entry about a 2nd century Book of Han reference of contests of unarmed combat.",
              "In this entry, author Lee Sung-Ji extended a 3rd century annotation of this reference to say that such competitions are like the Taekkyon of his time:[5] The word Taekkyon is written in Hangul, which denotes its connection with the common people while the other terms are written in hanja.",
              "Song Deok-gi who was the main preserver of Taekkyon during the 20th century, writes in the preface of his only book: \"It cannot be said for sure when and how Taekkyon came into existence, but until the end of the Korean kingdom, certain people did Taekkyon together.\"",
              "[6] Taekkyon was documented for the first time in the West as a living martial art by anthropologist Stewart Culin in his book Korean Games, written in 1895.",
              "[7] In the 1921 book Haedong Jukji (East Sea Annals) by Choe Yeong-nyeon, Taekkyon is called \"flying leg technique\".",
              "[8][9] Taekkyon was widely practiced during the Joseon period.",
              "Two versions existed at the time: one for combat application used by militaries, the other as a game, very popular among lower classes alongside Ssireum.",
              "Both combat sports were often done together at festivals, attended by all social classes.",
              "For example, during the Dan-O-Festival, a tournament called Gyeoll-yeon-taekkyon was carried out.",
              "Players who beat five opponents consecutively could take a rest and re-enter the tournament again later.",
              "[10] Taekkyon's popularity suffered as Neo-Confucianism became widespread among the elite and underwent a long period of decline.",
              "At the dawn of the 20th century, it was only practiced around the capital city of Hanyang (Seoul), in the district of Jongro.",
              "The subsequent Japanese occupation prohibited indigenous fighting techniques, which nearly made the art extinct.",
              "[11] The onslaught of the subsequent Korean War left only one surviving Master: Song Deok-gi.",
              "Being part of the last generation who received a traditional education under the tutelage of Master Im Ho,[12] he had maintained his practice in secret throughout the Japanese occupation and subsequently laid the seeds for the art's regeneration.",
              "The style he practiced was called \"Widae\" (\"high-village\") after his village of Sajik.",
              "Song was critical in the preservation of Taekkyon, since most of the current knowledge came from him.",
              "Revealed to the public on 26 March 1958 after a Martial arts demonstration given for then-president Syngman Rhee's birthday, Song became known as \"the Last Taekkyon Master of the Joseon Dynasty\".",
              "Deok-gi taught a handful of students who in turn taught others.",
              "On June 1, 1983, owing to the efforts of his pupil Shin Han-seung, Taekkyon was given the classification as Important Intangible Cultural Asset No.",
              "76\" by the Korean government.",
              "It is only one of two Korean martial arts which possesses such a classification.",
              "Song Deok-gi and Shin Han-seung were subsequently given living national treasure status by the South Korean government.",
              "[13] Since then, Taekkyon has been enjoying a renaissance with the establishment of university clubs, the opening of new schools and active promotional efforts from the government and associations alike.",
              "The first contemporary Taekkyon competition took place in Busan on June 30, 1985.",
              "[14] Afterwards, other schools have been established, splitting-up the Taekkyon scene between the followers of Song's teaching (current leaders of the Widae Taekkyon Preservation Association), and the tenants of Shin's, more focused on a sportive approach and bringing the art on the global stage.",
              "Deok-Gi died on 23 July 1987, at the age of 94.",
              "In November 2011, Taekkyon was recognized by UNESCO and placed on its Intangible Cultural Heritage List,[4] being honored as the first martial art on UNESCO's list, the other being Ssireum.",
              "[15] Taekkyon utilizes a wide variety of techniques including kicks, hands, knee, elbow strikes, pressure point attacks, throws, joint locks, headbutt and grapples.",

              "Though renowned for the variety of its kicks since the ancient ages, Taekkyon uses a lot of hand techniques.",
              "They target all area of the body and use every part of the arm: forearm, elbow, hand edge, back of the hand, fingertips.",

              "The palm or fist is often used to strike.",

              "It also teaches consideration: a skilled Taekkyeon practitioner can rapidly dominate an opponent, but a true master knows how to make an opponent withdraw without incurring damage.",
              "Unlike many hard, external Korean arts which are best suited for younger students, Taekkyon can be practiced well into old age.",
              "Because all movements are intended to harmonize with the structure of the human body, techniques are natural and minimally stressful.",
              "Part of the reason for this stems from the art's abandonment of normal warm-up and stretching exercises.",
              "Instead, the basic techniques, interspersed with brief series of hand pats along the length of tight muscles, provide the necessary muscle stretch and circulation boost.",

              "One method for releasing \"ki\" is through a \"kihap\", the forceful exhalation of air at the moment a technique is performed.",
              "However, Taekkyon's \"kihap\" differs from that of all other Korean and Japanese arts.",

              "Lee Yong-bok explains that, unlike most other fighting styles which advocate performing a linear technique and then finishing it, Taekkyon teaches students to continue techniques past their potential point of impact.",
              "In a violent encounter, Taekkyon strategy teaches that a person should stand directly in front of his attacker and move with a rhythmic motion that allows a quick, evasive slip to either side.",
              "In contrast to the linear movements in Taekwondo and other Korean arts, the Taekkyon student's body constantly moves forward and backward, to the left and to the right.",
              "Lee Yong-bok describes this strategy as the first skill of Taekkyon: staying away from the attacker's weapons.",
              "According to this logic, evasion is superior to blocking because, as long as an opponent's attack fails to make contact, his power does not matter.",
              "Taekkyon fighters move with a rhythm which beginning students sometimes learn while traditional Korean drums and bamboo flutes keep time.",
              "This rhythmical motion into and out of attack range further differentiates the style from all others.",
              "Similar movements have been found in the \"tal chum\", the centuries-old Korean mask dance.",
              "Herein lies another of Taekkyon's differences: During this continuous body motion, the arms constantly move up and down, out and back, and from side to side, confusing the opponent as to exact target locations.",
              "When combined with nimble footwork in four directions and occasional evasive jumping, a Taekkyon stylist becomes more difficult to hit.",
              "Taekkyon's kicks have proved so effective that the style does not even include among its hand strikes a traditional jab or reverse punch.",
              "The kicks are so legendary that, for hundreds of years the name of the art was synonymous with foot-fighting.",
              "However, the kicks bear little resemblance to the typical spinning and jumping maneuvers glorified in tournaments and film.",
              "Instead, Taekkyon leg techniques are simple and direct, focusing on linear moves but including limited usage of circular and spinning kicks.",
              "Taekkyon has traditionally emphasized stepping and stamping techniques directed at the opponent's lower legs and feet.",
              "In contrast to the intensity of Taekkyon when it existed only for combat, modern practice limits the damage that may be inflicted upon fellow students.",
              "Lee explains the traditional rules of friendly Taekkyon competition, probably developed within the past 100 years, as follows:Custom (greeting and bowing) comes first.",

              "Unlike many hard, external Korean arts which are best suited for younger students, Taekkyon can be practiced well into old age.",
              "Because all movements are intended to harmonize with the structure of the human body, techniques are natural and minimally stressful.",
              "Part of the reason for this stems from the art's abandonment of normal warm-up and stretching exercises.",
              "Instead, the basic techniques, interspersed with brief series of hand pats along the length of tight muscles, provide the necessary muscle stretch and circulation boost.",

              "One method for releasing \"ki\" is through a \"kihap\", the forceful exhalation of air at the moment a technique is performed.",
              "However, Taekkyon's \"kihap\" differs from that of all other Korean and Japanese arts.",

              "More sensible is to strike a hard target with a softer weapon-the palm heel, for example.",
              "Conversely, Taekkyon teaches that an attack to the fleshy mid-section is more effective if the striker uses a hard weapon such as the knee or elbow.",
              "Lee Yong-bok explains that, unlike most other fighting styles which advocate performing a linear technique and then finishing it, Taekkyon teaches students to continue techniques past their potential point of impact.",
              "In a violent encounter, Taekkyon strategy teaches that a person should stand directly in front of his attacker and move with a rhythmic motion that allows a quick, evasive slip to either side.",
              "In contrast to the linear movements in Taekwondo and other Korean arts, the Taekkyon student's body constantly moves forward and backward, to the left and to the right.",
              "Lee Yong-bok describes this strategy as the first skill of Taekkyon: staying away from the attacker's weapons.",
              "According to this logic, evasion is superior to blocking because, as long as an opponent's attack fails to make contact, his power does not matter.",
              "Taekkyon fighters move with a rhythm which beginning students sometimes learn while traditional Korean drums and bamboo flutes keep time.",
              "This rhythmical motion into and out of attack range further differentiates the style from all others.",
              "Similar movements have been found in the \"tal chum\", the centuries-old Korean mask dance.",
              "Herein lies another of Taekkyon's differences: During this continuous body motion, the arms constantly move up and down, out and back, and from side to side, confusing the opponent as to exact target locations.",
              "When combined with nimble footwork in four directions and occasional evasive jumping, a Taekkyon stylist becomes more difficult to hit.",
              "Taekkyon's kicks have proved so effective that the style does not even include among its hand strikes a traditional jab or reverse punch.",
              "The kicks are so legendary that, for hundreds of years the name of the art was synonymous with foot-fighting.",
              "However, the kicks bear little resemblance to the typical spinning and jumping maneuvers glorified in tournaments and film.",
              "Instead, Taekkyon leg techniques are simple and direct, focusing on linear moves but including limited usage of circular and spinning kicks.",
              "Taekkyon has traditionally emphasized stepping and stamping techniques directed at the opponent's lower legs and feet.",
              "In contrast to the intensity of Taekkyon when it existed only for combat, modern practice limits the damage that may be inflicted upon fellow students.",
              "Lee explains the traditional rules of friendly Taekkyon competition, probably developed within the past 100 years, as follows:Custom (greeting and bowing) comes first.",

              "As such, it has provided historical references for modern Korean martial arts and is often considered as the oldest martial discipline of Korea.",
              "[1] It was almost wiped out during the Japanese Occupation, before being rediscovered after the Korean War.",
              "It has influenced the name and conceptualization of Taekwondo.",
              "[2] Taekkyon was the first martial art enlisted in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.",
              "It is also the 76th Intangible Cultural Property of South Korea.",
              "[1][3][4] Historical records regarding Taekkyon are scant and ambiguous.",
              "The term is described as a Martial art, and probably is descended from earlier dynasties' Subak or as a folk game.",
              "The earliest written source of the term appears during the reign of King Jeongjo (1776\u20131800) of the Joseon Dynasty, in the book Jaemulbo (also Manmulbo), which included an entry about a 2nd century Book of Han reference of contests of unarmed combat.",
              "In this entry, author Lee Sung-Ji extended a 3rd century annotation of this reference to say that such competitions are like the Taekkyon of his time:[5] The word Taekkyon is written in Hangul, which denotes its connection with the common people while the other terms are written in hanja.",
              "Song Deok-gi who was the main preserver of Taekkyon during the 20th century, writes in the preface of his only book: \"It cannot be said for sure when and how Taekkyon came into existence, but until the end of the Korean kingdom, certain people did Taekkyon together.\"",
              "[6] Taekkyon was documented for the first time in the West as a living martial art by anthropologist Stewart Culin in his book Korean Games, written in 1895.",
              "[7] In the 1921 book Haedong Jukji (East Sea Annals) by Choe Yeong-nyeon, Taekkyon is called \"flying leg technique\".",
              "[8][9] Taekkyon was widely practiced during the Joseon period.",
              "Two versions existed at the time: one for combat application used by militaries, the other as a game, very popular among lower classes alongside Ssireum.",
              "Both combat sports were often done together at festivals, attended by all social classes.",
              "For example, during the Dan-O-Festival, a tournament called Gyeoll-yeon-taekkyon was carried out.",
              "Players who beat five opponents consecutively could take a rest and re-enter the tournament again later.",
              "[10] Taekkyon's popularity suffered as Neo-Confucianism became widespread among the elite and underwent a long period of decline.",
              "At the dawn of the 20th century, it was only practiced around the capital city of Hanyang (Seoul), in the district of Jongro.",
              "The subsequent Japanese occupation prohibited indigenous fighting techniques, which nearly made the art extinct.",
              "[11] The onslaught of the subsequent Korean War left only one surviving Master: Song Deok-gi.",
              "Being part of the last generation who received a traditional education under the tutelage of Master Im Ho,[12] he had maintained his practice in secret throughout the Japanese occupation and subsequently laid the seeds for the art's regeneration.",
              "The style he practiced was called \"Widae\" (\"high-village\") after his village of Sajik.",
              "Song was critical in the preservation of Taekkyon, since most of the current knowledge came from him.",
              "Revealed to the public on 26 March 1958 after a Martial arts demonstration given for then-president Syngman Rhee's birthday, Song became known as \"the Last Taekkyon Master of the Joseon Dynasty\".",
              "Deok-gi taught a handful of students who in turn taught others.",
              "On June 1, 1983, owing to the efforts of his pupil Shin Han-seung, Taekkyon was given the classification as Important Intangible Cultural Asset No.",

              "[13] Since then, Taekkyon has been enjoying a renaissance with the establishment of university clubs, the opening of new schools and active promotional efforts from the government and associations alike.",
              "The first contemporary Taekkyon competition took place in Busan on June 30, 1985.",
              "[14] Afterwards, other schools have been established, splitting-up the Taekkyon scene between the followers of Song's teaching (current leaders of the Widae Taekkyon Preservation Association), and the tenants of Shin's, more focused on a sportive approach and bringing the art on the global stage.",
              "Deok-Gi died on 23 July 1987, at the age of 94.",
              "In November 2011, Taekkyon was recognized by UNESCO and placed on its Intangible Cultural Heritage List,[4] being honored as the first martial art on UNESCO's list, the other being Ssireum.",
              "[15] Taekkyon utilizes a wide variety of techniques including kicks, hands, knee, elbow strikes, pressure point attacks, throws, joint locks, headbutt and grapples.",
              "[16] The whole body is used in each movement.",
              "Although Taekkyon primarily utilizes kicking, punching, and arm strikes thrown from a mobile stance and does not provide a framework for groundfighting, it does incorporate a variety of different throws, takedowns, and grappling techniques to complement its striking focus.",
              "The main purpose of Taekkyon is to catch the opponent off-timing by using the whole weight of the body and catching the opponent's attack off-balance before returning it against him.",
              "[17] The basic steps are geometric and at the core of all advanced movement.",
              "All movements are natural to the human body.",
              "The movements of Taekkyon are fluid with the practitioners constantly moving.",
              "One of its most striking characteristics is the motion called gumsil or neung-cheong: It is a constant bending and stretching of one's knees, giving the art a dance-like appearance.",
              "This motion is also used in the Korea mask dance Talchum, so both arts look similar in a way: the art is like a dance in which the fighter constantly changes stance from left to right by stepping forward and backwards with arms up and ready to guard, blending arm movements with leg.",
              "Taekkyon does not make use of abrupt knee motions.",
              "The principles and methods used to extend the kick put more emphasis on grace and alignment for whole-body strength, as with the arm motions.",
              "There are evolving forms in Taekkyon.",
              "One form can be performed many different ways with its variations over the basic ten-year training period.",
              "The curriculum is adjustable within the traditional system.",
              "Masters may create their own personalized approach for teaching the basic Taekkyon system.",
              "The most unique feature of Taekkyon is its triangular foot work called pumbalki or pum balbki (\u1111\u116e\u11b7\u1107\u1161\u11b2\u1100\u1175) which looks like a dance.",
              "The meaning of pumbalkki is \"to step the Pum\".",
              "Pum refers to the triangular look of the hanja \u54c1, as pumbalki has a triangular form as well.",
              "The hanja \"Pum\" means \"level\" or \"goods\", but it is used only because of its shape, not because of its meaning.",
              "[18] Footwork is smooth and rhythmic and enables rapid shifting of the center of gravity.",
              "It has the effect of strengthening the waist and lower part of the body as well as harmonizing attack and defense.",
              "Taekkyon's pumbalki is in the shape of an equilateral triangle (\u25b3).",
              "It is practiced in one place, but when fighting with real opponents it involves continual advancing and retreating moves.",
              "Hwalgaejit looks like the movement of a bird's wings.",
              "The shoulders are expanded naturally and must flow harmoniously with the footwork.",

              "The term is described as a Martial art, and probably is descended from earlier dynasties' Subak or as a folk game.",
              "The earliest written source of the term appears during the reign of King Jeongjo (1776\u20131800) of the Joseon Dynasty, in the book Jaemulbo (also Manmulbo), which included an entry about a 2nd century Book of Han reference of contests of unarmed combat.",

              "Song Deok-gi who was the main preserver of Taekkyon during the 20th century, writes in the preface of his only book: \"It cannot be said for sure when and how Taekkyon came into existence, but until the end of the Korean kingdom, certain people did Taekkyon together.\"",

              "As such, it has provided historical references for modern Korean martial arts and is often considered as the oldest martial discipline of Korea.",
              "[1] It was almost wiped out during the Japanese Occupation, before being rediscovered after the Korean War.",
              "It has influenced the name and conceptualization of Taekwondo.",
              "[2] Taekkyon was the first martial art enlisted in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.",
              "It is also the 76th Intangible Cultural Property of South Korea.",
              "[1][3][4] Historical records regarding Taekkyon are scant and ambiguous.",
              "The term is described as a Martial art, and probably is descended from earlier dynasties' Subak or as a folk game.",
              "The earliest written source of the term appears during the reign of King Jeongjo (1776\u20131800) of the Joseon Dynasty, in the book Jaemulbo (also Manmulbo), which included an entry about a 2nd century Book of Han reference of contests of unarmed combat.",
              "In this entry, author Lee Sung-Ji extended a 3rd century annotation of this reference to say that such competitions are like the Taekkyon of his time:[5] The word Taekkyon is written in Hangul, which denotes its connection with the common people while the other terms are written in hanja.",
              "Song Deok-gi who was the main preserver of Taekkyon during the 20th century, writes in the preface of his only book: \"It cannot be said for sure when and how Taekkyon came into existence, but until the end of the Korean kingdom, certain people did Taekkyon together.\"",
              "[6] Taekkyon was documented for the first time in the West as a living martial art by anthropologist Stewart Culin in his book Korean Games, written in 1895.",
              "[7] In the 1921 book Haedong Jukji (East Sea Annals) by Choe Yeong-nyeon, Taekkyon is called \"flying leg technique\".",
              "[8][9] Taekkyon was widely practiced during the Joseon period.",
              "Two versions existed at the time: one for combat application used by militaries, the other as a game, very popular among lower classes alongside Ssireum.",
              "Both combat sports were often done together at festivals, attended by all social classes.",
              "For example, during the Dan-O-Festival, a tournament called Gyeoll-yeon-taekkyon was carried out.",
              "Players who beat five opponents consecutively could take a rest and re-enter the tournament again later.",
              "[10] Taekkyon's popularity suffered as Neo-Confucianism became widespread among the elite and underwent a long period of decline.",
              "At the dawn of the 20th century, it was only practiced around the capital city of Hanyang (Seoul), in the district of Jongro.",
              "The subsequent Japanese occupation prohibited indigenous fighting techniques, which nearly made the art extinct.",
              "[11] The onslaught of the subsequent Korean War left only one surviving Master: Song Deok-gi.",
              "Being part of the last generation who received a traditional education under the tutelage of Master Im Ho,[12] he had maintained his practice in secret throughout the Japanese occupation and subsequently laid the seeds for the art's regeneration.",
              "The style he practiced was called \"Widae\" (\"high-village\") after his village of Sajik.",
              "Song was critical in the preservation of Taekkyon, since most of the current knowledge came from him.",
              "Revealed to the public on 26 March 1958 after a Martial arts demonstration given for then-president Syngman Rhee's birthday, Song became known as \"the Last Taekkyon Master of the Joseon Dynasty\".",
              "Deok-gi taught a handful of students who in turn taught others.",
              "On June 1, 1983, owing to the efforts of his pupil Shin Han-seung, Taekkyon was given the classification as Important Intangible Cultural Asset No.",

              "[13] Since then, Taekkyon has been enjoying a renaissance with the establishment of university clubs, the opening of new schools and active promotional efforts from the government and associations alike.",
              "The first contemporary Taekkyon competition took place in Busan on June 30, 1985.",
              "[14] Afterwards, other schools have been established, splitting-up the Taekkyon scene between the followers of Song's teaching (current leaders of the Widae Taekkyon Preservation Association), and the tenants of Shin's, more focused on a sportive approach and bringing the art on the global stage.",

              "In November 2011, Taekkyon was recognized by UNESCO and placed on its Intangible Cultural Heritage List,[4] being honored as the first martial art on UNESCO's list, the other being Ssireum.",
              "[15] Taekkyon utilizes a wide variety of techniques including kicks, hands, knee, elbow strikes, pressure point attacks, throws, joint locks, headbutt and grapples.",
              "[16] The whole body is used in each movement.",
              "Although Taekkyon primarily utilizes kicking, punching, and arm strikes thrown from a mobile stance and does not provide a framework for groundfighting, it does incorporate a variety of different throws, takedowns, and grappling techniques to complement its striking focus.",
              "The main purpose of Taekkyon is to catch the opponent off-timing by using the whole weight of the body and catching the opponent's attack off-balance before returning it against him.",
              "[17] The basic steps are geometric and at the core of all advanced movement.",
              "All movements are natural to the human body.",
              "The movements of Taekkyon are fluid with the practitioners constantly moving.",
              "One of its most striking characteristics is the motion called gumsil or neung-cheong: It is a constant bending and stretching of one's knees, giving the art a dance-like appearance.",
              "This motion is also used in the Korea mask dance Talchum, so both arts look similar in a way: the art is like a dance in which the fighter constantly changes stance from left to right by stepping forward and backwards with arms up and ready to guard, blending arm movements with leg.",
              "Taekkyon does not make use of abrupt knee motions.",
              "The principles and methods used to extend the kick put more emphasis on grace and alignment for whole-body strength, as with the arm motions.",
              "There are evolving forms in Taekkyon.",
              "One form can be performed many different ways with its variations over the basic ten-year training period.",

              "Masters may create their own personalized approach for teaching the basic Taekkyon system.",
              "The most unique feature of Taekkyon is its triangular foot work called pumbalki or pum balbki (\u1111\u116e\u11b7\u1107\u1161\u11b2\u1100\u1175) which looks like a dance.",
              "The meaning of pumbalkki is \"to step the Pum\".",
              "Pum refers to the triangular look of the hanja \u54c1, as pumbalki has a triangular form as well.",
              "The hanja \"Pum\" means \"level\" or \"goods\", but it is used only because of its shape, not because of its meaning.",
              "[18] Footwork is smooth and rhythmic and enables rapid shifting of the center of gravity.",
              "It has the effect of strengthening the waist and lower part of the body as well as harmonizing attack and defense.",
              "Taekkyon's pumbalki is in the shape of an equilateral triangle (\u25b3).",
              "It is practiced in one place, but when fighting with real opponents it involves continual advancing and retreating moves.",
              "Hwalgaejit looks like the movement of a bird's wings.",
              "The shoulders are expanded naturally and must flow harmoniously with the footwork.",
              "While improving the body's reflexes, responsiveness and balance, it also help distract the opponent's attention before the counterattack.",
              "It is mainly used defensively to block or catch an opponent blow.",
              "Hwalgejit movements transfer power from the body to the arms in order to enhance power for quick action.",
              "Taekkyon has been so renowned for its leg techniques that ancient chronicles referred to it with poetic names such as \"one-hundred godlike flying leg skills\" (baek gisintong bigaksul), \"leg art\" (gak sul), or \"flying leg skills\" (bi gak sul).",
              "[19][20] Modern Taekkyon schools teach a great variety of kicks, low, medium, and high, as well as jumps.",
              "Sweeps with straight forward low kicks using the ball of the foot and the heel and flowing crescent-like high kicks.",
              "There are many kicks that move the leg outward from the middle, which is called gyeot chigi, and inward from the outside using the side of the heels and the side of the feet.",
              "The art also uses tricks like inward trips, wall-jumping, fake-outs, tempo, and slide-stepping.",
              "Though renowned for the variety of its kicks since the ancient ages, Taekkyon uses a lot of hand techniques.",
              "They target all area of the body and use every part of the arm: forearm, elbow, hand edge, back of the hand, fingertips.",
              "Techniques must be used in coordination with the pumbalki so that the springing power can be transferred to the upper members.",
              "The palm or fist is often used to strike.",
              "Though hand techniques have been used for self-defense until the Widae style, the three modern schools only teach it at an advanced level as part of the \"Yetbeop Taekkyon\".",
              "Taekkyon uses techniques for throwing the opponent to the front or backward.",
              "Once the opponent is unbalanced, the user can follow with either a throw or a trip.",
              "The important thing is to use the opponent's own power to counterattack.",
              "These techniques are for locking and twisting an opponent's articulations.",
              "Counter an opponent's attack by locking a joint and follow with a hand or leg attack.",
              "Taekkyon jousts have evolved into a modern sport and tournaments are held by the three modern schools all over Korea.",
              "And also authorized discipline in Korea National Championships.",
              "When Taekkyon is practiced in competition, it uses a limited subset of techniques, focusing on grappling and kicking only.",
              "Points are scored by throwing (or tripping) the opponent to the ground, pushing them out of the ring, or kicking them in the head.",
              "There are no hand strikes or headbutts, and purposefully injuring your opponent is prohibited.",
              "The head kicks are often quite sharp, but usually not full force, and fighters may not attempt to wear the opponent down with body blows as in western Boxing or Muay Thai.",
              "Matches are sometimes decided by the best of three falls\u2014the first fighter to score two points wins.",
              "However, different modern associations employ slightly different rules.",
              "The contestants circle each other, changing their footwork constantly using pumbalkki and feinting with low kicks, before attacking suddenly.",
              "Various Taekkyon organisations currently exist in Korea and overseas.",
              "These include: Taekkyon is also practiced around the world with schools in Australia, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Kazakhstan, Norway, Russia, United Kingdom and the USA.",
              "Medieval records mention that several street fighting games and techniques existed in Korea at the time, up until the twentieth century.",
              "Due to the elite's scorn and contempt for martial activities, Taekkyon came to be perceived as a fighting method for thugs and sometimes confused with such disciplines:[28] Sibak (\u1109\u1175\u1107\u1161\u11a8),[28] Pyeonssaum (\u1111\u1167\u11ab\u110a\u1161\u110b\u116e\u11b7),[29] Nalparam (\u1102\u1161\u11af\u1111\u1161\u1105\u1161\u11b7),[30] Nanjanbaksi (\u1102\u1161\u11ab\u110c\u1161\u11ab\u1107\u1161\u11a8\u1109\u1175),[31] Taegyeok (\u1110\u1162\u1100\u1167\u11a8).",

              "Though renowned for the variety of its kicks since the ancient ages, Taekkyon uses a lot of hand techniques.",
              "They target all area of the body and use every part of the arm: forearm, elbow, hand edge, back of the hand, fingertips.",
              "Techniques must be used in coordination with the pumbalki so that the springing power can be transferred to the upper members.",
              "The palm or fist is often used to strike.",
              "Though hand techniques have been used for self-defense until the Widae style, the three modern schools only teach it at an advanced level as part of the \"Yetbeop Taekkyon\".",
              "Taekkyon uses techniques for throwing the opponent to the front or backward.",
              "Once the opponent is unbalanced, the user can follow with either a throw or a trip.",
              "The important thing is to use the opponent's own power to counterattack.",
              "These techniques are for locking and twisting an opponent's articulations.",
              "Counter an opponent's attack by locking a joint and follow with a hand or leg attack.",

              "When Taekkyon is practiced in competition, it uses a limited subset of techniques, focusing on grappling and kicking only.",
              "Points are scored by throwing (or tripping) the opponent to the ground, pushing them out of the ring, or kicking them in the head.",
              "There are no hand strikes or headbutts, and purposefully injuring your opponent is prohibited.",

              "This motion is also used in the Korea mask dance Talchum, so both arts look similar in a way: the art is like a dance in which the fighter constantly changes stance from left to right by stepping forward and backwards with arms up and ready to guard, blending arm movements with leg.",

              "It has the effect of strengthening the waist and lower part of the body as well as harmonizing attack and defense.",

              "There are many kicks that move the leg outward from the middle, which is called gyeot chigi, and inward from the outside using the side of the heels and the side of the feet.",
              "The art also uses tricks like inward trips, wall-jumping, fake-outs, tempo, and slide-stepping.",
              "Though renowned for the variety of its kicks since the ancient ages, Taekkyon uses a lot of hand techniques.",
              "They target all area of the body and use every part of the arm: forearm, elbow, hand edge, back of the hand, fingertips.",
              "Techniques must be used in coordination with the pumbalki so that the springing power can be transferred to the upper members.",
              "The palm or fist is often used to strike.",
              "Though hand techniques have been used for self-defense until the Widae style, the three modern schools only teach it at an advanced level as part of the \"Yetbeop Taekkyon\".",
              "Taekkyon uses techniques for throwing the opponent to the front or backward.",
              "Once the opponent is unbalanced, the user can follow with either a throw or a trip.",
              "The important thing is to use the opponent's own power to counterattack.",
              "These techniques are for locking and twisting an opponent's articulations.",
              "Counter an opponent's attack by locking a joint and follow with a hand or leg attack.",

              "And also authorized discipline in Korea National Championships.",
              "When Taekkyon is practiced in competition, it uses a limited subset of techniques, focusing on grappling and kicking only.",
              "Points are scored by throwing (or tripping) the opponent to the ground, pushing them out of the ring, or kicking them in the head.",
              "There are no hand strikes or headbutts, and purposefully injuring your opponent is prohibited.",
              "The head kicks are often quite sharp, but usually not full force, and fighters may not attempt to wear the opponent down with body blows as in western Boxing or Muay Thai.",
