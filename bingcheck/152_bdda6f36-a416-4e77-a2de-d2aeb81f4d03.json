              "All of these forms of communication link otherwise separate individuals in such a way that they can share and express their singular experiences and work together collaboratively.",
              "In a new study, technology replaces language as a means of communicating by directly linking the activity of human brains.",
              "Electrical activity from the brains of a pair of human subjects was transmitted to the brain of a third individual in the form of magnetic signals, which conveyed an instruction to perform a task in a particular manner.",
              "This study opens the door to extraordinary new means of human collaboration while, at the same time, blurring fundamental notions about individual identity and autonomy in disconcerting ways.",
              "Direct brain-to-brain communication has been a subject of intense interest for many years, driven by motives as diverse as futurist enthusiasm and military exigency.",
              "In his book Beyond Boundaries one of the leaders in the field, Miguel Nicolelis, described the merging of human brain activity as the future of humanity, the next stage in our species\u2019 evolution.",
              "(Nicolelis serves on Scientific American\u2019s board of advisers.)",
              "He has already conducted a study in which he linked together the brains of several rats using complex implanted electrodes known as brain-to-brain interfaces.",
              "Nicolelis and his co-authors described this achievement as the first \u201corganic computer\u201d with living brains tethered together as if they were so many microprocessors.",
              "The animals in this network learned to synchronize the electrical activity of their nerve cells to the same extent as those in a single brain.",
              "The networked brains were tested for things such as their ability to discriminate between two different patterns of electrical stimuli, and they routinely outperformed individual animals.",
              "If networked rat brains are \u201csmarter\u201d than a single animal, imagine the capabilities of a biological supercomputer of networked human brains.",
              "Such a network could enable people to work across language barriers.",
              "It could provide those whose ability to communicate is impaired with a new means of doing so.",
              "Moreover, if the rat study is correct, networking human brains might enhance performance.",
              "Could such a network be a faster, more efficient and smarter way of working together?",
              "The new paper addressed some of these questions by linking together the brain activity of a small network of humans.",
              "Three individuals sitting in separate rooms collaborated to correctly orient a block so that it could fill a gap between other blocks in a video game.",
              "Two individuals who acted as \u201csenders\u201d could see the gap and knew whether the block needed to be rotated to fit.",
              "The third individual, who served as the \u201creceiver,\u201d was blinded to the correct answer and needed to rely on the instructions sent by the senders.",
              "The two senders were equipped with electroencephalographs (EEGs) that recorded their brain\u2019s electrical activity.",
              "Senders were able to see the orientation of the block and decide whether to signal the receiver to rotate it.",
              "They focused on a light flashing at a high frequency to convey the instruction to rotate or focused on one flashing at a low frequency to signal not to do so.",
              "The differences in the flashing frequencies caused disparate brain responses in the senders, which were captured by the EEGs and sent, via computer interface, to the receiver.",
              "A magnetic pulse was delivered to the receiver using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device if a sender signaled to rotate.",
              "That magnetic pulse caused a flash of light (a phosphene) in the receiver\u2019s visual field as a cue to turn the block.",
              "The absence of a signal within a discrete period of time was the instruction not to turn the block.",
              "After gathering instructions from both senders, the receiver decided whether to rotate the block.",
              "Like the senders, the receiver was equipped with an EEG, in this case to signal that choice to the computer.",
              "Once the receiver decided on the orientation of the block, the game concluded, and the results were given to all three participants.",
              "This provided the senders with a chance to evaluate the receiver\u2019s actions and the receiver with a chance to assess the accuracy of each sender.",
              "The team was then given a second chance to improve its performance.",
              "Overall, five groups of individuals were tested using this network, called the \u201cBrainNet,\u201d and, on average, they achieved greater than 80 percent accuracy in completing the task.",
              "In order to escalate the challenge, investigators sometimes added noise to the signal sent by one of the senders.",
              "Faced with conflicting or ambiguous directions, the receivers quickly learned to identify and follow the instructions of the more accurate sender.",
              "This process emulated some of the features of \u201cconventional\u201d social networks, according to the report.",
              "This study is a natural extension of work previously done in laboratory animals.",
              "In addition to the work linking together rat brains, Nicolelis\u2019s laboratory is responsible for linking multiple primate brains into a \u201cBrainet\u201d (not to be confused with the BrainNet discussed above), in which the primates learned to cooperate in the performance of a common task via brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).",
              "This time, three primates were connected to the same computer with implanted BCIs and simultaneously tried to move a cursor to a target.",
              "The animals were not directly linked to each other in this case, and the challenge was for them to perform a feat of parallel processing, each directing its activity toward a goal while continuously compensating for the activity of the others.",
              "Brain-to-brain interfaces also span across species, with humans using noninvasive methods similar to those in the BrainNet study to control cockroaches or rats that had surgically implanted brain interfaces.",
              "In one report, a human using a noninvasive brain interface linked, via computer, to the BCI of an anesthetized rat was able to move the animal\u2019s tail.",
              "While in another study, a human controlled a rat as a freely moving cyborg.",
              "The investigators in the new paper point out that it is the first report in which the brains of multiple humans have been linked in a completely noninvasive manner.",
              "They claim that the number of individuals whose brains could be networked is essentially unlimited.",
              "Yet the information being conveyed is currently very simple: a yes-or-no binary instruction.",
              "Other than being a very complex way to play a Tetris-like video game, where could these efforts lead?",
              "The authors propose that information transfer using noninvasive approaches could be improved by simultaneously imaging brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to increase the information a sender could transmit.",
              "But fMRI is not a simple procedure, and it would expand the complexity of an already extraordinarily complex approach to sharing information.",
              "The researchers also propose that TMS could be delivered, in a focused manner, to specific brain regions in order to elicit awareness of particular semantic content in the receiver\u2019s brain.",
              "Meanwhile the tools for more invasive\u2014and perhaps more efficient\u2014brain interfacing are developing rapidly.",
              "Elon Musk recently announced the development of a robotically implantable BCI containing 3,000 electrodes to provide extensive interaction between computers and nerve cells in the brain.",
              "While impressive in scope and sophistication, these efforts are dwarfed by government plans.",
              "The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been leading engineering efforts to develop an implantable neural interface capable of engaging one million nerve cells simultaneously.",
              "While these BCIs are not being developed specifically for brain\u2013to-brain interfacing, it is not difficult to imagine that they could be recruited for such purposes.",
              "Even though the methods used here are noninvasive and therefore appear far less ominous than if a DARPA neural interface had been used, the technology still raises ethical concerns, particularly because the associated technologies are advancing so rapidly.",
              "For example, could some future embodiment of a brain-to-brain network enable a sender to have a coercive effect on a receiver, altering the latter\u2019s sense of agency?",
              "Could a brain recording from a sender contain information that might someday be extracted and infringe on that person\u2019s privacy?",
              "Could these efforts, at some point, compromise an individual\u2019s sense of personhood?",
              "This work takes us a step closer to the future Nicolelis imagined, in which, in the words of the late Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist Murray Gell-Man, \u201cthoughts and feelings would be completely shared with none of the selectivity or deception that language permits.",
              "\u201d In addition to being somewhat voyeuristic in this pursuit of complete openness, Nicolelis misses the point.",
              "One of the nuances of human language is that often what is not said is as important as what is.",
              "The content concealed in privacy of one\u2019s mind is the core of individual autonomy.",
              "Whatever we stand to gain in collaboration or computing power by directly linking brains may come at the cost of things that are far more important.",

              "For example, the first human BBI demonstrated by Rao and colleagues in 20132 decoded motor intention signals using EEG in the Sender and conveyed the intention via TMS directly to the motor cortex of the Receiver to complete a visual-motor task1.",
              "Stocco and colleagues5 extended these results by showing that a Sender and a Receiver can iteratively exchange information using a BBI to identify an unknown object from a list, using a question-and-answer paradigm akin to \u201c20 Questions.",

              "Early interest in human BBIs came from the potential for expanding human communication and social interaction capabilities6,7,8,9,10.",
              "However, previous BBIs have lacked several key features of real-world human communication.",
              "First, the degree of interactivity has been minimal;",
              "for example, in the case of the \u201c20 Questions\u201d BBI5, the Sender only responds to the question the Receiver chooses, and the Receiver\u2019s performance does not affect the Sender\u2019s decision.",
              "Second, their interface required physical action: the Receiver touched the screen to select a question.",
              "Thus, the communication loop was completed via a motor output channel rather than a brain interface.",
              "Third, all past human BBIs have only allowed two subjects.",
              "Human communication, on the other hand, has become increasingly dominated by means such as social media that allow multiple parties to interact in a network.",
              "The potential for BBIs that allow interactions between multiple humans has previously been theorized3,11 but not demonstrated.",
              "Here, we present BrainNet (Fig.",
              "1), a next-generation BBI that addresses many of the limitations of past BBIs.",
              "First, BrainNet is designed to be a BBI for more than two human subjects;",
              "its current implementation allows two Senders and one Receiver to communicate, but it can be readily scaled up to include larger numbers of Senders.",
              "The Senders have the same role in observing the current state of the task and conveying their decisions to the Receiver.",
              "The Receiver has the role of integrating these independent decisions and deciding on a course of action.",
              "Second, BrainNet\u2019s design incorporates a second round of interactions between the Senders and the Receiver, so that the action of the Receiver in the first round can be perceived by the Senders, giving them a second chance to convey (potentially corrective) decisions to the Receiver.",
              "Third, the Receiver is equipped with both TMS (to receive Senders\u2019 decisions) and EEG (to perform an action in the task), thereby completely eliminating the need to use any physical movements to convey information.",
              "We report results from five groups, each with three human subjects (henceforth, \u201ctriad\u201d), who successfully used BrainNet to perform a collaborative task based on a Tetris-like game.",

              "Two participants (\u201cSender 1\u201d and \u201cSender 2\u201d) each use a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on EEG to convey information about a collaborative task (here, a Tetris-like game) directly to the brain of the third participant (\u201cReceiver\u201d).",

              "While our experiment only used two rounds, BrainNet allows an arbitrary number of interactions between the Senders and the Receiver as they collaborate to solve a task.",
              "BrainNet differs from a previous interface called \u201cBrainet\u201d12 which combines recordings from multiple monkey brains to perform a common motor task but is unidirectional and does not use stimulation to communicate information back to any of the brains.",
              "An important feature of communication in social networks is deciding which sources of information to pay attention to when deciding on a course of action13.",
              "To investigate whether BrainNet allows such a capability, we additionally explored whether the Receiver can learn the reliability of each Sender over the course of their brain-to-brain interactions.",

              "To measure the direct brain-to-brain communication capabilities of BrainNet, we asked each triad of participants to perform 16 trials of an iterative Tetris-like game.",
              "In each trial, one participant, designated as the Receiver, is in charge of deciding whether or not to rotate a block before it drops to fill a gap in a line at the bottom of the screen.",
              "Critically, the Receiver is prevented from seeing the bottom part of the screen and must rely on the counsel of the other two participants, designated as the Senders, who can see the screen in its entirety.",
              "These Senders are tasked with making the correct decision (rotate or not) based on the shape of the current block and the gap at the bottom, and informing the Receiver of the decision via the brain-to-brain interface.",

              "see Methods).",
              "The Senders\u2019 decisions are delivered to the Receiver through two TMS pulses delivered sequentially to the occipital cortex, eliciting a phosphene for a \u201cyes\u201d decision or no phosphene for a \u201cno\u201d rotation decision for each Sender (see Methods).",
              "Each trial is composed of two rounds: the first round is as described above;",
              "after the first round, the Senders are given the opportunity to examine the Receiver\u2019s decision, shown on their screen as the block (now potentially rotated) mid-way through its fall.",

              "A longstanding debate concerns whether this is achieved through enhancing processing of relevant information and/or by inhibiting irrelevant information.",
              "To address this, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during fMRI, and tested for causal changes in information coding.",
              "Participants attended to one feature, whilst ignoring another feature, of a visual object.",
              "If dlPFC is necessary for facilitation, disruptive TMS should decrease coding of attended features.",
              "Conversely, if dlPFC is crucial for inhibition, TMS should increase coding of ignored features.",
              "Here, we show that TMS decreases coding of relevant information across frontoparietal cortex, and the impact is significantly stronger than any effect on irrelevant information, which is not statistically detectable.",
              "This provides causal evidence for a specific role of dlPFC in enhancing task-relevant representations and demonstrates the cognitive-neural insights possible with concurrent TMS-fMRI-MVPA.",
              "A critical aspect of successful goal-directed behaviour is the ability to distinguish between information that is relevant for your current task and distracting irrelevant information.",
              "How does the brain achieve this selection?",
              "One prominent theory, termed the adaptive coding hypothesis1,2,3, posits that prefrontal neurons adjust their responses to preferentially code the information relevant for behaviour, which in turn modulates responses in specialised cortices4,5.",
              "In a similar vein, Miller and Cohen6 have long suggested that attention biases competing inputs in favour of relevant information (see also ref.",
              "7).",
              "Evidence for these models stems from non-human primate (NHP) research where prefrontal neurons were shown to maintain task-relevant information in delayed-response tasks (see refs.",
              "8,9) and flexibly encode the behavioural significance of visual stimuli, regardless of their physical properties10,11,12,13,14,15,16, while microstimulation work indicates causal top-down effects17,18.",
              "Recent observations indicate that prefrontal neurons can be driven by nonlinear combinations of multiple task features, referred to as mixed selectivity19,20, and that both relevant and irrelevant features, and task rules and decisions, can be coded by independent, dynamic patterns of activity across a neural population21,22,23,24.",
              "Together, these features align with a key role for the prefrontal cortex in selecting and integrating task-relevant information3,21.",
              "In the human brain, a network referred to as the multiple-demand (MD) network2, has been shown to encode a range of task features25 with a strong preference for attended information over information that is irrelevant26,27,28,29,30.",
              "This network includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the anterior insula and frontal operculum (AI/FO), intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the pre-supplementary motor area and adjacent anterior cingulate (ACC/pre-SMA).",
              "The MD network appears to be well-optimised for information selection, integration and exchange, with strong connectivity between the core regions of this network31 and task-dependent connections to other networks32.",
              "Of the regions of this network, the dlPFC is frequently theorised to be a likely candidate for top-down signals that influence neural activity according to behavioural relevance6,33,34,35,36,37, perhaps mediated by coherently oscillating neuronal assemblies38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45.",
              "Despite this large body of work, causal evidence is still lacking.",
              "In the human brain particularly, we lack causal evidence relating dlPFC activity to the representation of information elsewhere.",
              "This follows since the majority of human work has used either neuroimaging, which alone is unable to draw causal links between network interactions, brain function and behaviour, or causal methods that do not incorporate neuroimaging or study of information coding.",
              "To overcome this limitation, in this study, we combined concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)\u2014a causal method for intervening on neural activity\u2014with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA).",
              "The disruptive effect of TMS allows for a test of causality, and the use of MVPA allows inference about the information coded in the system.",
              "Thus, our approach tests for the causal influences of dlPFC on information representation across the brain.",
              "The combination of techniques also allowed us to address an open mechanistic question concerning the contribution of facilitatory and inhibitory mechanisms in information selection.",
              "Does prefrontal function primarily facilitate the representation of task-relevant information or contribute to suppressing task-irrelevant information?",
              "Some influential theories on selective attention have principally focused on the mechanisms that facilitate the processing of task-relevant information (e.",
              "g., adaptive coding hypothesis)1 with any suppression of irrelevant information resulting from local competition between inputs (e.",
              "g., biased competition)7,46,47.",
              "Early human fMRI work has supported a facilitatory account, for example, in a modified Stroop paradigm48, BOLD responses were increased in fusiform face area (FFA), under a high (incongruent trial follows an incongruent trial) compared to a low control condition (incongruent follows congruent), but only when the face stimuli served as targets, not as distractors.",
              "This was accompanied by increased functional coupling between FFA and dlPFC.",
              "Others, however, have emphasised direct inhibition mechanisms, such as the suppression of task-irrelevant brain regions mediated by alpha-band oscillations49,50,51,52.",
              "For example, occipital alpha power is typically higher contralateral to the unattended side of space than contralateral to the attended side53,54,55,56, with alpha-power increases linked to the proactive suppression of distractors57, and decreases associated with increased spike activity and better task performance58.",
              "These alpha modulations may be driven by prefrontal areas41.",
              "On the other hand, it has been argued that the data typically taken as evidence for suppression are equally compatible with an account of selection through signal enhancement59.",
              "It may be the case, for example, that the observed effects reflect secondary inhibition related to facilitation of the relevant inputs.",
              "This is difficult to untangle without intervening on the system, but a previous concurrent TMS-fMRI study demonstrates the logic for how we might contrast facilitatory and inhibitory effects.",
              "Feredoes et al.",
              "60 stimulated right dlPFC while participants remembered a target and ignored a distractor.",
              "They showed that dlPFC TMS modulated BOLD signals specifically in posterior brain areas corresponding to the current memory targets (e.",
              "g., FFA for faces), rather than the distractor items (e.",
              "g., parahippocampal place area, for houses), suggesting that control is exerted primarily through modulating processing of task-relevant items. Here, we used a similar logic but went a step further in examining the effect of TMS on the representation of task-relevant and -irrelevant information, which, using MVPA, we could separate out even within single brain regions.",
              "This is important because modulations in the overall signal may not reflect changes in the representation of information, and because it allowed us to ask about facilitation and inhibition in frontoparietal regions that might reasonably be expected to respond to multiple different aspects of stimuli.",
              "Thus, we aimed to provide a strong test of the contribution of facilitatory versus inhibitory mechanisms in selection by establishing the causal impact of dlPFC on the representation of this information elsewhere in the brain.",
              "In this study, participants selectively attended to one (relevant) feature of a visual object, such as its colour, and ignored another (irrelevant) feature of the same object, such as its shape, whilst we applied a short train of TMS to the right dlPFC.",
              "Right dlPFC was selected as the stimulation target because TMS to this region of interest (ROI) has been shown to modulate activation in a task requiring selective attention60.",
              "We tested the following hypotheses: the primary role of the right dlPFC is to (1) upregulate relevant information, (2) downregulate irrelevant information or (3) both upregulate relevant and downregulate irrelevant information.",
              "If the right dlPFC normally enhances coding of attended information, then disrupting it with TMS should decrease coding of attended stimulus features across the MD network (disruption to the system) and visual cortices (top-down modulation).",
              "Conversely, if the right dlPFC suppresses irrelevant information, then disrupting this function should increase coding of the unattended feature.",
              "If right dlPFC plays both roles, then TMS should both decrease relevant and increase irrelevant information coding.",
              "Another hypothesis (4) is that the right dlPFC may play a general role in supporting all information processing (no specific role in attentional selection).",
              "Under this alternative, TMS would decrease both relevant and irrelevant information coding.",
              "A final hypothesis (5) is that the right dlPFC has no role in supporting information processing, in which case we would expect no change in information coding with TMS.",
              "We tested these predictions in the MD regions, to test network function2,3, and in visual cortices (lateral occipital complex (LOC), V4, early visual cortex) and across the whole brain (using a roaming searchlight), to assess top-down modulation4,37.",
              "The results supported hypothesis 1 with Active TMS reducing coding of relevant information in the MD regions, but having no detectable effect on coding of irrelevant information.",
              "The data provide causal evidence that the dlPFC biases processing elsewhere in the brain by selectively facilitating coding of task-relevant information.",
              "We combined TMS with fMRI and used MVPA to examine the causal influence of right dlPFC activity on information coding in the brain.",
              "Participants attended to and reported one feature of a novel object (e.",

              "g., its form) in alternating task blocks (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "We adopted a TMS protocol where participants received a train of 3 pulses, 75 ms following stimulus onset, at a frequency of 13 Hz.",
              "The train was delivered to the right dlPFC (Fig.",
              "2) on every trial at either high-intensity (110% motor threshold (MT), Active condition) or low-intensity TMS (40% MT, Control condition).",
              "On each trial, participants saw a target object that they had to categorise according to either its form (angular/curvilinear) or colour (green/blue) in alternating blocks (a).",
              "A picture cue at the start of each block indicated the current task (form or colour;",
              "b).",
              "On each trial, a cue reminded participants of the current task (500 ms) followed by the object to categorise (100 ms), during which they received a train of 3 TMS pulses (13 Hz, high or low intensity, onset 75 ms after stimulus).",
              "Participants were instructed to respond before the white cross (500 ms) turned black.",
              "If participants responded within 500 ms, the white cross turned black for the remainder of the 500 ms and was in either case followed by a black cross for a jittered interval of 3500\u20134000 ms. In the example shown, participants are cued to attend to shape and the correct response would be the left button.",
              "The stimulus\u2013response mappings for the two dimensions meant that for some stimuli, their shape and colour required the same button response (congruent) and for other stimuli, their shape called for one button and its colour called for the other button (incongruent).",
              "The trial depicted in this figure is a congruent trial as the correct button response for its shape is left, and its blue colour would also have indicated the left button during the colour task.",
              "In (c), the four presented objects are displayed prior to masking for illustration purposes.",
              "Functional activation and connectivity maps from previous studies (as in legend) were used to select MNI152 coordinates [44 31 28] as a group-level reference for right dlPFC target (cross hair).",
              "After deforming to native space, we defined the target stimulation site on an individual-participant basis using the peak activation from individual-participant functional localiser data that was within 14 mm of this reference point.",
              "As an indirect measure of the relative contribution of the relevant and irrelevant stimulus dimensions to behaviour, we compared performance for stimuli in which colour and form mapped onto the same button-press response (congruent) to those where the two stimulus dimensions indicated different button-press responses (incongruent).",
              "We further asked whether this congruency effect was modulated by TMS and checked that there was no modulation of these effects by task (colour or form).",

              "Direct brain-to-brain communication has been a subject of intense interest for many years, driven by motives as diverse as futurist enthusiasm and military exigency.",
              "In his book Beyond Boundaries one of the leaders in the field, Miguel Nicolelis, described the merging of human brain activity as the future of humanity, the next stage in our species\u2019 evolution.",
              "(Nicolelis serves on Scientific American\u2019s board of advisers.)",
              "He has already conducted a study in which he linked together the brains of several rats using complex implanted electrodes known as brain-to-brain interfaces.",
              "Nicolelis and his co-authors described this achievement as the first \u201corganic computer\u201d with living brains tethered together as if they were so many microprocessors.",
              "The animals in this network learned to synchronize the electrical activity of their nerve cells to the same extent as those in a single brain.",
              "The networked brains were tested for things such as their ability to discriminate between two different patterns of electrical stimuli, and they routinely outperformed individual animals.",
              "If networked rat brains are \u201csmarter\u201d than a single animal, imagine the capabilities of a biological supercomputer of networked human brains.",
              "Such a network could enable people to work across language barriers.",
              "It could provide those whose ability to communicate is impaired with a new means of doing so.",
              "Moreover, if the rat study is correct, networking human brains might enhance performance.",
              "Could such a network be a faster, more efficient and smarter way of working together?",
              "The new paper addressed some of these questions by linking together the brain activity of a small network of humans.",
              "Three individuals sitting in separate rooms collaborated to correctly orient a block so that it could fill a gap between other blocks in a video game.",
              "Two individuals who acted as \u201csenders\u201d could see the gap and knew whether the block needed to be rotated to fit.",
              "The third individual, who served as the \u201creceiver,\u201d was blinded to the correct answer and needed to rely on the instructions sent by the senders.",
              "The two senders were equipped with electroencephalographs (EEGs) that recorded their brain\u2019s electrical activity.",
              "Senders were able to see the orientation of the block and decide whether to signal the receiver to rotate it.",
              "They focused on a light flashing at a high frequency to convey the instruction to rotate or focused on one flashing at a low frequency to signal not to do so.",
              "The differences in the flashing frequencies caused disparate brain responses in the senders, which were captured by the EEGs and sent, via computer interface, to the receiver.",
              "A magnetic pulse was delivered to the receiver using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device if a sender signaled to rotate.",
              "That magnetic pulse caused a flash of light (a phosphene) in the receiver\u2019s visual field as a cue to turn the block.",
              "The absence of a signal within a discrete period of time was the instruction not to turn the block.",
              "After gathering instructions from both senders, the receiver decided whether to rotate the block.",
              "Like the senders, the receiver was equipped with an EEG, in this case to signal that choice to the computer.",
              "Once the receiver decided on the orientation of the block, the game concluded, and the results were given to all three participants.",
              "This provided the senders with a chance to evaluate the receiver\u2019s actions and the receiver with a chance to assess the accuracy of each sender.",
              "The team was then given a second chance to improve its performance.",
              "Overall, five groups of individuals were tested using this network, called the \u201cBrainNet,\u201d and, on average, they achieved greater than 80 percent accuracy in completing the task.",
              "In order to escalate the challenge, investigators sometimes added noise to the signal sent by one of the senders.",
              "Faced with conflicting or ambiguous directions, the receivers quickly learned to identify and follow the instructions of the more accurate sender.",
              "This process emulated some of the features of \u201cconventional\u201d social networks, according to the report.",
              "This study is a natural extension of work previously done in laboratory animals.",
              "In addition to the work linking together rat brains, Nicolelis\u2019s laboratory is responsible for linking multiple primate brains into a \u201cBrainet\u201d (not to be confused with the BrainNet discussed above), in which the primates learned to cooperate in the performance of a common task via brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).",
              "This time, three primates were connected to the same computer with implanted BCIs and simultaneously tried to move a cursor to a target.",
              "The animals were not directly linked to each other in this case, and the challenge was for them to perform a feat of parallel processing, each directing its activity toward a goal while continuously compensating for the activity of the others.",
              "Brain-to-brain interfaces also span across species, with humans using noninvasive methods similar to those in the BrainNet study to control cockroaches or rats that had surgically implanted brain interfaces.",
              "In one report, a human using a noninvasive brain interface linked, via computer, to the BCI of an anesthetized rat was able to move the animal\u2019s tail.",
              "While in another study, a human controlled a rat as a freely moving cyborg.",
              "The investigators in the new paper point out that it is the first report in which the brains of multiple humans have been linked in a completely noninvasive manner.",
              "They claim that the number of individuals whose brains could be networked is essentially unlimited.",
              "Yet the information being conveyed is currently very simple: a yes-or-no binary instruction.",
              "Other than being a very complex way to play a Tetris-like video game, where could these efforts lead?",
              "The authors propose that information transfer using noninvasive approaches could be improved by simultaneously imaging brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to increase the information a sender could transmit.",
              "But fMRI is not a simple procedure, and it would expand the complexity of an already extraordinarily complex approach to sharing information.",
              "The researchers also propose that TMS could be delivered, in a focused manner, to specific brain regions in order to elicit awareness of particular semantic content in the receiver\u2019s brain.",
              "Meanwhile the tools for more invasive\u2014and perhaps more efficient\u2014brain interfacing are developing rapidly.",
              "Elon Musk recently announced the development of a robotically implantable BCI containing 3,000 electrodes to provide extensive interaction between computers and nerve cells in the brain.",
              "While impressive in scope and sophistication, these efforts are dwarfed by government plans.",
              "The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been leading engineering efforts to develop an implantable neural interface capable of engaging one million nerve cells simultaneously.",
              "While these BCIs are not being developed specifically for brain\u2013to-brain interfacing, it is not difficult to imagine that they could be recruited for such purposes.",
              "Even though the methods used here are noninvasive and therefore appear far less ominous than if a DARPA neural interface had been used, the technology still raises ethical concerns, particularly because the associated technologies are advancing so rapidly.",
              "For example, could some future embodiment of a brain-to-brain network enable a sender to have a coercive effect on a receiver, altering the latter\u2019s sense of agency?",
              "Could a brain recording from a sender contain information that might someday be extracted and infringe on that person\u2019s privacy?",
              "Could these efforts, at some point, compromise an individual\u2019s sense of personhood?",
              "This work takes us a step closer to the future Nicolelis imagined, in which, in the words of the late Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist Murray Gell-Man, \u201cthoughts and feelings would be completely shared with none of the selectivity or deception that language permits.",
              "\u201d In addition to being somewhat voyeuristic in this pursuit of complete openness, Nicolelis misses the point.",
              "One of the nuances of human language is that often what is not said is as important as what is.",
              "The content concealed in privacy of one\u2019s mind is the core of individual autonomy.",

              "For example, the first human BBI demonstrated by Rao and colleagues in 20132 decoded motor intention signals using EEG in the Sender and conveyed the intention via TMS directly to the motor cortex of the Receiver to complete a visual-motor task1.",
              "Stocco and colleagues5 extended these results by showing that a Sender and a Receiver can iteratively exchange information using a BBI to identify an unknown object from a list, using a question-and-answer paradigm akin to \u201c20 Questions.",

              "Early interest in human BBIs came from the potential for expanding human communication and social interaction capabilities6,7,8,9,10.",
              "However, previous BBIs have lacked several key features of real-world human communication.",
              "First, the degree of interactivity has been minimal;",
              "for example, in the case of the \u201c20 Questions\u201d BBI5, the Sender only responds to the question the Receiver chooses, and the Receiver\u2019s performance does not affect the Sender\u2019s decision.",
              "Second, their interface required physical action: the Receiver touched the screen to select a question.",
              "Thus, the communication loop was completed via a motor output channel rather than a brain interface.",
              "Third, all past human BBIs have only allowed two subjects.",
              "Human communication, on the other hand, has become increasingly dominated by means such as social media that allow multiple parties to interact in a network.",
              "The potential for BBIs that allow interactions between multiple humans has previously been theorized3,11 but not demonstrated.",
              "Here, we present BrainNet (Fig.",
              "1), a next-generation BBI that addresses many of the limitations of past BBIs.",
              "First, BrainNet is designed to be a BBI for more than two human subjects;",
              "its current implementation allows two Senders and one Receiver to communicate, but it can be readily scaled up to include larger numbers of Senders.",
              "The Senders have the same role in observing the current state of the task and conveying their decisions to the Receiver.",
              "The Receiver has the role of integrating these independent decisions and deciding on a course of action.",
              "Second, BrainNet\u2019s design incorporates a second round of interactions between the Senders and the Receiver, so that the action of the Receiver in the first round can be perceived by the Senders, giving them a second chance to convey (potentially corrective) decisions to the Receiver.",
              "Third, the Receiver is equipped with both TMS (to receive Senders\u2019 decisions) and EEG (to perform an action in the task), thereby completely eliminating the need to use any physical movements to convey information.",
              "We report results from five groups, each with three human subjects (henceforth, \u201ctriad\u201d), who successfully used BrainNet to perform a collaborative task based on a Tetris-like game.",
              "Architecture of BrainNet.",
              "Two participants (\u201cSender 1\u201d and \u201cSender 2\u201d) each use a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on EEG to convey information about a collaborative task (here, a Tetris-like game) directly to the brain of the third participant (\u201cReceiver\u201d).",

              "While our experiment only used two rounds, BrainNet allows an arbitrary number of interactions between the Senders and the Receiver as they collaborate to solve a task.",
              "BrainNet differs from a previous interface called \u201cBrainet\u201d12 which combines recordings from multiple monkey brains to perform a common motor task but is unidirectional and does not use stimulation to communicate information back to any of the brains.",
              "An important feature of communication in social networks is deciding which sources of information to pay attention to when deciding on a course of action13.",
              "To investigate whether BrainNet allows such a capability, we additionally explored whether the Receiver can learn the reliability of each Sender over the course of their brain-to-brain interactions.",

              "e., whose signal quality is not affected by our manipulation.",
              "To measure the direct brain-to-brain communication capabilities of BrainNet, we asked each triad of participants to perform 16 trials of an iterative Tetris-like game.",
              "In each trial, one participant, designated as the Receiver, is in charge of deciding whether or not to rotate a block before it drops to fill a gap in a line at the bottom of the screen.",
              "Critically, the Receiver is prevented from seeing the bottom part of the screen and must rely on the counsel of the other two participants, designated as the Senders, who can see the screen in its entirety.",
              "These Senders are tasked with making the correct decision (rotate or not) based on the shape of the current block and the gap at the bottom, and informing the Receiver of the decision via the brain-to-brain interface.",
              "All members of the triad communicate their decisions through an EEG-based interface using steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs;",
              "see Methods).",
              "The Senders\u2019 decisions are delivered to the Receiver through two TMS pulses delivered sequentially to the occipital cortex, eliciting a phosphene for a \u201cyes\u201d decision or no phosphene for a \u201cno\u201d rotation decision for each Sender (see Methods).",
              "Each trial is composed of two rounds: the first round is as described above;",
              "after the first round, the Senders are given the opportunity to examine the Receiver\u2019s decision, shown on their screen as the block (now potentially rotated) mid-way through its fall.",
              "The Senders are then given another chance to make new (possibly corrective) suggestions to the Receiver through the brain-to-brain interface.",
              "A successful completion of a trial thus requires accurate communication between the Senders and the Receiver across these two rounds (see Fig.",
              "2).",
              "Further, to examine the issue of reliability of the Senders, our software randomly chooses one Sender to be less reliable by making the decision sent to the Receiver from that Sender incorrect in ten out of sixteen trials.",
              "The order of trials requiring the block to be rotated and trials not requiring rotation was pseudo-randomized, with the constraint that each half of the session contained 4 rotation and 4 non-rotation trials.",
              "Trials 8\u201312 for the first triad were excluded from all analysis due to a problem with the timestamp routine.",

              "The screen the Receiver saw also had visual prompts to remind them whose decision the current TMS stimulation was conveying.",
              "Receivers made their decision based on whether a phosphene was perceived and conveyed their decision (rotate or do not rotate) to the game using the same SSVEP-based procedure used by both Senders.",
              "After the game state was updated, the trial moved into the second round and the above process was repeated.",
              "At the end of each trial, all three subjects received feedback on the result of the trial (Fig.",
              "2, bottom row).",
              "When the decisions from the two Senders do not agree with each other, the Receiver must decide which Sender to trust.",
              "To investigate whether the Receiver can learn the reliability of each Sender and choose the more reliable Sender for making decisions, we designed the system to deliberately make one of the Senders less accurate than the other.",
              "Specifically, for each session, one Sender was randomly chosen as the \u201cBad\u201d Sender and, in 10 out of sixteen trials, this Sender\u2019s decision when sent to the Receiver was forced to be incorrect, both in the first and second round of each trial.",
              "Each Sender performed the task in a dedicated room in front of a 21\u201d LCD monitor, with two Arduino-controlled LED lights attached to the left and right outer frames of the monitor for eliciting SSVEPs.",
              "EEG signals were recorded through an 8-channel OpenBCI Cyton system (OpenBCI: Brooklyn, NY) with a sampling rate of 250 Hz at a resolution of 16 bits.",

              "For the experimental session, three electrodes were set up along the midline in a custom montage with the signal recorded from one occipital electrode (location Oz in the 10\u201310 placement system) and two frontal electrodes (locations AFz and FCz in the 10\u201310 system) used as the ground and reference, respectively.",
              "Incoming EEG data was passed through a 4th-order Butterworth filter30 between 0 and 30 Hz to remove signal drifting and line noise.",
              "The time-series EEG data was then divided into 1-second epochs and transformed to the frequency domain using Welch\u2019s method31.",
              "The intention to rotate the falling block or not was decoded by comparing the power at 17 Hz and 15 Hz obtained from Welch\u2019s method.",
              "The final decision was made by tallying up the number of epochs in which the greatest power was recorded at either 17 Hz or 15 Hz over a 10-second period.",
              "Signal processing and data storage were managed through a custom software library developed by two of the authors (LJ and DL).",
              "There is no prior training required for controlling the cursor using SSVEPs.",
              "During the experiment, the Sender\u2019s monitor displays either the cursor-control interface or a gray background with a text prompt indicating that the Receiver is making a decision.",
              "Participants playing the role of the Receiver came in for two consecutive sessions.",
              "During the first session, as part of informed consent, they were asked to complete a TMS safety screening questionnaire, aimed at identifying potential conditions (such as family history of seizures or frequent migraines) that might represent potential risk factors for adverse side effects of TMS.",
              "No participant was rejected for failing the safety questionnaire.",
              "In addition to the safety screening, all Receivers underwent a procedure to determine their absolute phosphene threshold, that is, the minimum amount of stimulation necessary to elicit the perception of an induced phosphene 50% of the time.",
              "The absolute threshold was assessed using the PEST method32.",
              "The absolute threshold was then used as the starting point to identify the stimulation levels associated with the binary \u201cRotate\u201d and \u201cDo Not Rotate\u201d decisions.",
              "Starting from the absolute threshold, the stimulation intensity was first adjusted upwards in increments of 5% until phosphenes could be elicited for 10 consecutive pulses;",
              "this value was then used for conveying a \u201cRotate\u201d decision from a Sender.",
              "Then, starting from the absolute threshold value, the stimulation intensity was lowered in 5% increments until no phosphene was elicited for 10 consecutive pulses.",

              "The EEG procedure for the Receiver was identical to that used for the Senders, except that the signal was acquired from a BrainAmp system (BrainVision, Berlin, Germany) with a sampling rate of 5000 Hz and a resolution of 20 bits.",
              "The system was equipped with a DC voltage amplifier to reduce signal distortions due to the TMS pulses.",

              "October 29, 2019 6 min read Work on an \u201cInternet of brains\u201d takes another step By Robert Martone Getty Images We humans have evolved a rich repertoire of communication, from gesture to sophisticated languages.",
              "All of these forms of communication link otherwise separate individuals in such a way that they can share and express their singular experiences and work together collaboratively.",
              "In a new study, technology replaces language as a means of communicating by directly linking the activity of human brains.",
              "Electrical activity from the brains of a pair of human subjects was transmitted to the brain of a third individual in the form of magnetic signals, which conveyed an instruction to perform a task in a particular manner.",
              "This study opens the door to extraordinary new means of human collaboration while, at the same time, blurring fundamental notions about individual identity and autonomy in disconcerting ways.",
              "Direct brain-to-brain communication has been a subject of intense interest for many years, driven by motives as diverse as futurist enthusiasm and military exigency.",
              "In his book Beyond Boundaries one of the leaders in the field, Miguel Nicolelis, described the merging of human brain activity as the future of humanity, the next stage in our species\u2019 evolution.",
              "(Nicolelis serves on Scientific American\u2019s board of advisers.)",
              "He has already conducted a study in which he linked together the brains of several rats using complex implanted electrodes known as brain-to-brain interfaces.",
              "Nicolelis and his co-authors described this achievement as the first \u201corganic computer\u201d with living brains tethered together as if they were so many microprocessors.",
              "The animals in this network learned to synchronize the electrical activity of their nerve cells to the same extent as those in a single brain.",
              "The networked brains were tested for things such as their ability to discriminate between two different patterns of electrical stimuli, and they routinely outperformed individual animals.",
              "If networked rat brains are \u201csmarter\u201d than a single animal, imagine the capabilities of a biological supercomputer of networked human brains.",
              "Such a network could enable people to work across language barriers.",
              "It could provide those whose ability to communicate is impaired with a new means of doing so.",
              "Moreover, if the rat study is correct, networking human brains might enhance performance.",
              "Could such a network be a faster, more efficient and smarter way of working together?",
              "The new paper addressed some of these questions by linking together the brain activity of a small network of humans.",
              "Three individuals sitting in separate rooms collaborated to correctly orient a block so that it could fill a gap between other blocks in a video game.",
              "Two individuals who acted as \u201csenders\u201d could see the gap and knew whether the block needed to be rotated to fit.",
              "The third individual, who served as the \u201creceiver,\u201d was blinded to the correct answer and needed to rely on the instructions sent by the senders.",
              "The two senders were equipped with electroencephalographs (EEGs) that recorded their brain\u2019s electrical activity.",
              "Senders were able to see the orientation of the block and decide whether to signal the receiver to rotate it.",
              "They focused on a light flashing at a high frequency to convey the instruction to rotate or focused on one flashing at a low frequency to signal not to do so.",
              "The differences in the flashing frequencies caused disparate brain responses in the senders, which were captured by the EEGs and sent, via computer interface, to the receiver.",
              "A magnetic pulse was delivered to the receiver using a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device if a sender signaled to rotate.",
              "That magnetic pulse caused a flash of light (a phosphene) in the receiver\u2019s visual field as a cue to turn the block.",
              "The absence of a signal within a discrete period of time was the instruction not to turn the block.",
              "After gathering instructions from both senders, the receiver decided whether to rotate the block.",
              "Like the senders, the receiver was equipped with an EEG, in this case to signal that choice to the computer.",
              "Once the receiver decided on the orientation of the block, the game concluded, and the results were given to all three participants.",
              "This provided the senders with a chance to evaluate the receiver\u2019s actions and the receiver with a chance to assess the accuracy of each sender.",
              "The team was then given a second chance to improve its performance.",
              "Overall, five groups of individuals were tested using this network, called the \u201cBrainNet,\u201d and, on average, they achieved greater than 80 percent accuracy in completing the task.",
              "In order to escalate the challenge, investigators sometimes added noise to the signal sent by one of the senders.",
              "Faced with conflicting or ambiguous directions, the receivers quickly learned to identify and follow the instructions of the more accurate sender.",
              "This process emulated some of the features of \u201cconventional\u201d social networks, according to the report.",
              "This study is a natural extension of work previously done in laboratory animals.",
              "In addition to the work linking together rat brains, Nicolelis\u2019s laboratory is responsible for linking multiple primate brains into a \u201cBrainet\u201d (not to be confused with the BrainNet discussed above), in which the primates learned to cooperate in the performance of a common task via brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).",
              "This time, three primates were connected to the same computer with implanted BCIs and simultaneously tried to move a cursor to a target.",
              "The animals were not directly linked to each other in this case, and the challenge was for them to perform a feat of parallel processing, each directing its activity toward a goal while continuously compensating for the activity of the others.",
              "Brain-to-brain interfaces also span across species, with humans using noninvasive methods similar to those in the BrainNet study to control cockroaches or rats that had surgically implanted brain interfaces.",
              "In one report, a human using a noninvasive brain interface linked, via computer, to the BCI of an anesthetized rat was able to move the animal\u2019s tail.",
              "While in another study, a human controlled a rat as a freely moving cyborg.",
              "The investigators in the new paper point out that it is the first report in which the brains of multiple humans have been linked in a completely noninvasive manner.",
              "They claim that the number of individuals whose brains could be networked is essentially unlimited.",
              "Yet the information being conveyed is currently very simple: a yes-or-no binary instruction.",
              "Other than being a very complex way to play a Tetris-like video game, where could these efforts lead?",
              "The authors propose that information transfer using noninvasive approaches could be improved by simultaneously imaging brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to increase the information a sender could transmit.",
              "But fMRI is not a simple procedure, and it would expand the complexity of an already extraordinarily complex approach to sharing information.",
              "The researchers also propose that TMS could be delivered, in a focused manner, to specific brain regions in order to elicit awareness of particular semantic content in the receiver\u2019s brain.",
              "Meanwhile the tools for more invasive\u2014and perhaps more efficient\u2014brain interfacing are developing rapidly.",
              "Elon Musk recently announced the development of a robotically implantable BCI containing 3,000 electrodes to provide extensive interaction between computers and nerve cells in the brain.",
              "While impressive in scope and sophistication, these efforts are dwarfed by government plans.",
              "The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been leading engineering efforts to develop an implantable neural interface capable of engaging one million nerve cells simultaneously.",
              "While these BCIs are not being developed specifically for brain\u2013to-brain interfacing, it is not difficult to imagine that they could be recruited for such purposes.",
              "Even though the methods used here are noninvasive and therefore appear far less ominous than if a DARPA neural interface had been used, the technology still raises ethical concerns, particularly because the associated technologies are advancing so rapidly.",
              "For example, could some future embodiment of a brain-to-brain network enable a sender to have a coercive effect on a receiver, altering the latter\u2019s sense of agency?",
              "Could a brain recording from a sender contain information that might someday be extracted and infringe on that person\u2019s privacy?",
              "Could these efforts, at some point, compromise an individual\u2019s sense of personhood?",
              "This work takes us a step closer to the future Nicolelis imagined, in which, in the words of the late Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist Murray Gell-Man, \u201cthoughts and feelings would be completely shared with none of the selectivity or deception that language permits.",
              "\u201d In addition to being somewhat voyeuristic in this pursuit of complete openness, Nicolelis misses the point.",
              "One of the nuances of human language is that often what is not said is as important as what is.",
              "The content concealed in privacy of one\u2019s mind is the core of individual autonomy.",
              "Whatever we stand to gain in collaboration or computing power by directly linking brains may come at the cost of things that are far more important.",

              "Second, their interface required physical action: the Receiver touched the screen to select a question.",
              "Thus, the communication loop was completed via a motor output channel rather than a brain interface.",

              "Here, we present BrainNet (Fig.",
              "1), a next-generation BBI that addresses many of the limitations of past BBIs.",
              "First, BrainNet is designed to be a BBI for more than two human subjects;",
              "its current implementation allows two Senders and one Receiver to communicate, but it can be readily scaled up to include larger numbers of Senders.",
              "The Senders have the same role in observing the current state of the task and conveying their decisions to the Receiver.",
              "The Receiver has the role of integrating these independent decisions and deciding on a course of action.",
              "Second, BrainNet\u2019s design incorporates a second round of interactions between the Senders and the Receiver, so that the action of the Receiver in the first round can be perceived by the Senders, giving them a second chance to convey (potentially corrective) decisions to the Receiver.",
              "Third, the Receiver is equipped with both TMS (to receive Senders\u2019 decisions) and EEG (to perform an action in the task), thereby completely eliminating the need to use any physical movements to convey information.",
              "We report results from five groups, each with three human subjects (henceforth, \u201ctriad\u201d), who successfully used BrainNet to perform a collaborative task based on a Tetris-like game.",
              "Architecture of BrainNet.",
              "Two participants (\u201cSender 1\u201d and \u201cSender 2\u201d) each use a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on EEG to convey information about a collaborative task (here, a Tetris-like game) directly to the brain of the third participant (\u201cReceiver\u201d).",
              "Information from each Sender is transmitted over the internet to the Receiver\u2019s brain via a Computer-Brain Interface (CBI) based on TMS.",
              "After consciously processing the two inputs from the Senders, the Receiver uses a BCI based on EEG to execute an action in the task.",
              "The Senders see the result of this action on their screens (the same updated game state is shown on both screens, as indicated by the red arrow from one Sender\u2019s screen to the other).",
              "The Senders then have another opportunity to convey to the Receiver\u2019s brain new information to potentially rectify an incorrect choice in the first round.",
              "While our experiment only used two rounds, BrainNet allows an arbitrary number of interactions between the Senders and the Receiver as they collaborate to solve a task.",
              "BrainNet differs from a previous interface called \u201cBrainet\u201d12 which combines recordings from multiple monkey brains to perform a common motor task but is unidirectional and does not use stimulation to communicate information back to any of the brains.",
              "An important feature of communication in social networks is deciding which sources of information to pay attention to when deciding on a course of action13.",
              "To investigate whether BrainNet allows such a capability, we additionally explored whether the Receiver can learn the reliability of each Sender over the course of their brain-to-brain interactions.",

              "e., whose signal quality is not affected by our manipulation.",
              "To measure the direct brain-to-brain communication capabilities of BrainNet, we asked each triad of participants to perform 16 trials of an iterative Tetris-like game.",
              "In each trial, one participant, designated as the Receiver, is in charge of deciding whether or not to rotate a block before it drops to fill a gap in a line at the bottom of the screen.",
              "Critically, the Receiver is prevented from seeing the bottom part of the screen and must rely on the counsel of the other two participants, designated as the Senders, who can see the screen in its entirety.",
              "These Senders are tasked with making the correct decision (rotate or not) based on the shape of the current block and the gap at the bottom, and informing the Receiver of the decision via the brain-to-brain interface.",
              "All members of the triad communicate their decisions through an EEG-based interface using steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs;",
              "see Methods).",
              "The Senders\u2019 decisions are delivered to the Receiver through two TMS pulses delivered sequentially to the occipital cortex, eliciting a phosphene for a \u201cyes\u201d decision or no phosphene for a \u201cno\u201d rotation decision for each Sender (see Methods).",
              "Each trial is composed of two rounds: the first round is as described above;",
              "after the first round, the Senders are given the opportunity to examine the Receiver\u2019s decision, shown on their screen as the block (now potentially rotated) mid-way through its fall.",
              "The Senders are then given another chance to make new (possibly corrective) suggestions to the Receiver through the brain-to-brain interface.",
              "A successful completion of a trial thus requires accurate communication between the Senders and the Receiver across these two rounds (see Fig.",
              "2).",
              "Further, to examine the issue of reliability of the Senders, our software randomly chooses one Sender to be less reliable by making the decision sent to the Receiver from that Sender incorrect in ten out of sixteen trials.",
              "The order of trials requiring the block to be rotated and trials not requiring rotation was pseudo-randomized, with the constraint that each half of the session contained 4 rotation and 4 non-rotation trials.",
              "Trials 8\u201312 for the first triad were excluded from all analysis due to a problem with the timestamp routine.",

              "Each TMS pulse lasted 1 ms. An eight-second delay was enforced between the two pulses to remain within the strictest safety guidelines of TMS stimulation29.",
              "The intensity of the stimulation was set above or below the threshold at which the Receiver could perceive a flash of light known as a phosphene: a \u201cYes\u201d response was translated to an intensity above the threshold, and \u201cNo\u201d was translated to an intensity below the threshold.",
              "During each round of trials, the Receiver always received the decision from one Sender first, then the other.",

              "After the game state was updated, the trial moved into the second round and the above process was repeated.",
              "At the end of each trial, all three subjects received feedback on the result of the trial (Fig.",

              "When the decisions from the two Senders do not agree with each other, the Receiver must decide which Sender to trust.",
              "To investigate whether the Receiver can learn the reliability of each Sender and choose the more reliable Sender for making decisions, we designed the system to deliberately make one of the Senders less accurate than the other.",
              "Specifically, for each session, one Sender was randomly chosen as the \u201cBad\u201d Sender and, in 10 out of sixteen trials, this Sender\u2019s decision when sent to the Receiver was forced to be incorrect, both in the first and second round of each trial.",
              "Each Sender performed the task in a dedicated room in front of a 21\u201d LCD monitor, with two Arduino-controlled LED lights attached to the left and right outer frames of the monitor for eliciting SSVEPs.",

              "The time-series EEG data was then divided into 1-second epochs and transformed to the frequency domain using Welch\u2019s method31.",
              "The intention to rotate the falling block or not was decoded by comparing the power at 17 Hz and 15 Hz obtained from Welch\u2019s method.",
              "The final decision was made by tallying up the number of epochs in which the greatest power was recorded at either 17 Hz or 15 Hz over a 10-second period.",
              "Signal processing and data storage were managed through a custom software library developed by two of the authors (LJ and DL).",

              "During the first session, as part of informed consent, they were asked to complete a TMS safety screening questionnaire, aimed at identifying potential conditions (such as family history of seizures or frequent migraines) that might represent potential risk factors for adverse side effects of TMS.",
              "No participant was rejected for failing the safety questionnaire.",

              "Starting from the absolute threshold, the stimulation intensity was first adjusted upwards in increments of 5% until phosphenes could be elicited for 10 consecutive pulses;",
              "this value was then used for conveying a \u201cRotate\u201d decision from a Sender.",

              "While being similar from a conceptual point of view, the ethical issues involved will likely be more complicated in multi-person BBIs: In networks of directly connected brains, especially in multi-person BBIs consisting of large groups of individuals, each participant may be expected to have the role of both a sender and a recipient.",

              "With large networks, difficult questions relating to the influence of individual network participants and individual and collective responsibility will arise.",
              "Also, complex implications on the users' concept of self and sense of identity may be expected, as discussed elsewhere (see Hildt, 2015).",
              "Furthermore, BBIs and multi-person BBI networks raise a number of autonomy related issues.",

              "Primarily, through the risk that information retrieved from individual brains is distributed widely among the network without the individual's agreement.",
              "It will be crucial that all participants in BBI networks participate voluntarily and give their free and informed consent.",
              "A precondition for informed consent is that all individuals\u2014both senders and recipients\u2014are aware of what type of signals are recorded, collected, transferred, and received, and what the implications may be.",
              "This requires informed consent forms not only to delineate the technical details but also to describe possible implications on privacy, agency, and identity.",
              "All of this may be difficult to achieve, however.",
              "On the side of the sender, informed consent requires that senders are able to control the type and amount of brain signals to be recorded and transferred.",
              "One option may be to choose very specific brain signals and thus limit BBI functionality\u2014as was done in the Jiang et al.",
              "study with the use of a binary signal.",
              "With more volatile BBIs such as those involving fMRI, the situation will be much more complex and it will be much more difficult to ensure the senders' autonomy.",
              "For autonomy reasons, it may be necessary to limit the volatility of BBIs and the spectrum of technologies used.",
              "Privacy issues arise when a person's brain data is recorded and used, and the person is not aware of it or does not want the data to be recorded, transformed or distributed.",
              "This is particularly relevant when the data allows for conclusions to be drawn on the individual's condition or mental states.",
              "Regarding the question of how to regulate neuroscience and neurotechnology, Ienca and Andorno argue in favor of a \u201cright to brain privacy,\u201d which \u201caims to protect people against illegitimate access to their brain information and to prevent the indiscriminate leakage of brain data across the infosphere\u201d (Ienca and Andorno, 2017, p.",
              "15).",
              "They point out that brain data retrieved from a person's brain can be considered to be \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d that deserves protection.",
              "With regard to privacy protection, current and also possible future advanced techniques to identify individuals have to be taken into consideration (see Rocher et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "In order to protect individuals from unknowingly giving away sensitive information in BBIs and similar systems, there is a clear need to increase awareness of autonomy and privacy issues related to brain signals, to be transparent about what data is recorded and used and what the implications of this may be.",
              "On the side of the receiver, individual autonomy requires that participants in multi-brain BBIs are able to control what type of information they want to receive, from whom, and when.",
              "Especially when it comes to large brain networks, a mechanism will be required to reduce noise, limit input, and suppress unwanted senders.",
              "With large networks, something similar to \u201clike buttons\u201d or \u201cdislike buttons\u201d in current social media might be imaginable, with which receivers may be able to block or reduce certain types of transmissions or senders.",
              "Interestingly, the study published by Jiang et al.",
              "already investigated this principle, i.",
              "e., the possibility for receivers to \u201cweigh\u201d the relevance of a sender and to rely more heavily on preferred senders.",
              "Can receivers in BBI networks be harmed?",
              "While the signals transferred will influence their neural computation, it is unclear right now what the implications could be and whether there is a risk of overstimulation.",
              "The risks will vary considerably, depending on the technology used, the type of signal transferred, and the type of network.",
              "Also, questions related to identity have to be considered here, especially in more volatile BBIs (Hildt, 2015).",
              "Several authors have suggested a \u201cright to mental integrity\u201d that allows individuals to protect their brains from potential harm (Ienca and Andorno, 2017;",
              "Lavazza, 2018).",
              "In case of potential harm, such a right could allow receivers to limit brain input in BBIs.",
              "However, on the receiver side, much more flexibility could be achieved by referring to individual autonomy and informed consent.",
              "These concepts would not be confined to protect from potential harm but would also include protection from any kind of unwanted signal.",
              "Additional autonomy related questions arise as participants in BBI networks depend heavily on other network members and the input they provide.",
              "The role of recipients is to rely on the inputs received, to find out who are the most reliable senders, and to make decisions based on the inputs and past experiences.",
              "In this, a lot of uncertainty and guessing will be involved, especially as it will often be unclear where the input or information originally came from.",
              "For recipients in brain networks, individual or autonomous decision-making seems very difficult if not almost impossible.",
              "This is problematic in itself, not just in view of the possibility of fake news or brain hacking (Ienca and Haselager, 2016).",
              "A concept of \u201cextended autonomy\u201d may be conceivable here, related to the idea of extended mind and cognition (see Clark and Chalmers, 1998).",
              "Furthermore, the possibility to negotiate joint commitment, similar to what is normally done through language communication, will be crucial for collective BBI-based agency (Gilbert, 1990;",
              "Dingemanse, 2017).",
              "BBIs and BBI networks are not science-fiction any more, they are technically feasible in principle, even though at present, BBI research clearly is in its infancy.",
              "BBIs come along with a number of currently unresolved ethical issues including autonomy, privacy, agency, accountability, and identity.",
              "While it is questionable whether multi-person BBIs will have broad applications in the near future, some very specific uses seem conceivable.",
              "If research is to continue in this field, there is a clear need to start thinking right now about how to responsibly shape the development and future use of BBIs and direct brain communication.",
              "A first step in this process could be to have an interdisciplinary team of researchers develop recommendations or guidelines, possibly using a recent Portuguese document (Pais-Vieira and Pais-Vieira, 2018) as one of the starting points.",

              "Challenged by the limitation, scientists and researchers have developed a brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technology that can transform brain signals into human actions independent of the peripheral nerves or muscles.",
              "BCI, also called brain\u2013machine interface, provides direct communication between brain and external devices, such as computers and robotic limbs [1\u20134].",

              "BCI provides a non-muscular communication channel and facilitates acquisition, manipulation, analysis, and translation of brain signals to control external devices or applications.",
              "Since its conception in 1973 by Vidal [5], BCI has remained an active area of research with enormous promising opportunities [6\u201314].",

              "In particular situations, control signals from the BCI application may be sent back to the brain to stimulate some common human functionalities, such as vision and hearing.",
              "Main components of the brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) system This component comprises an electronic device with electrodes for acquiring brain signals (oscillating electrical voltages caused by biological activities of the brain) that define its neurophysiological states.",
              "Signal acquisition involves capturing of electrophysiological signals that represent specific activities of the brain (e.",
              "g., movement, speech, hearing, and vision).",
              "Most BCI systems, including the commercial ones, deal with the following electrophysiological signals: electroencephalography, brain\u2019s electrical activity measured with electrodes placed on the scalp [36, 37];",
              "electrocorticography [38\u201340], electroencephalographic signals measured directly with electrodes placed on the surgically exposed cerebral cortex;",
              "local field potential [41], electric potential measured around the neuron\u2019s extracellular space;",
              "and neuronal action potential [42, 43], rapid and temporary change in the neuron\u2019s membrane potential.",
              "Before being presented to the next BCI component, the captured brain signals undergo filtering, amplification, and digitization [21].",
              "The overall performance of the BCI system depends heavily on the quality (signal-to-noise ratio) of the acquired brain signals.",
              "Depending on the signal acquisition method, BCI can broadly be categorized into two types: invasive (electrodes implanted under the scalp to record signals directly from the brain) and non-invasive (electrodes implanted on the scalp).",
              "Invasive BCI provides a more accurate reading of brain signals, but requires surgery;",
              "non-invasive BCI does not require surgery, but suffers from weak brain signals (poor signal-to-noise ratio) that require expensive amplification hardware and sophisticated signal processing techniques.",
              "In this stage, the BCI system extracts critical electrophysiological features from the acquired signals to define brain activities, and hence encoding of the user\u2019s intent [21].",
              "Similar to the previous stage, feature extraction should be executed accurately, ensuring that the features reflect high correlation with the user\u2019s intent to enhance the effectiveness and performance of the BCI system.",
              "Typical BCI systems employ time-domain or frequency-domain features [44\u201351] that take different characteristics: amplitude or latency of event-evoked potentials (e.",
              "g., P300), frequency power spectra (e.",
              "g., sensorimotor rhythms), or neuronal firing rates [21].",
              "Therefore, before designing the BCI system, the domain transform and characteristics of features should be established.",
              "Also, confounding artifacts contained in the features that can negatively impact the subsequent stages of the BCI system should be eliminated.",
              "The extracted features represent brain activities intended for desired actions.",
              "The classification process helps to recognize patterns of the features corresponding to these actions.",
              "For example, we can recognize features representing an instruction for moving a robotic arm.",
              "This component is usually implemented using machine learning and classification methods [52\u201354].",
              "In this signal processing stage, the classified features are translated and transformed into actual commands to operate an external device (BCI application).",
              "Examples of the outputs given after feature extraction include commands for cursor movement on the computer screen, volume control on the audio device, or text writing.",
              "One important attribute of an algorithm for feature translation is adaptability [55, 56]: ability of the translation algorithm to adaptively track changes of the features and generate an appropriate output.",
              "Feature translation generates commands that can control external devices (BCI applications): cursor [57\u201360] for letter and text selection on the computer screen [44, 45, 61], wheelchair [62, 63], and robotic arm [64, 65].",
              "For BCI restoration problems, the control signals from the BCI application may be transmitted to the brain or other body organs.",

              "The BCI technology allows physically challenged people to control machines using their thoughts.",
              "This advantage gives such people a revealing experience to interact with the external environment and accomplish different activities without dependence from healthy people.",
              "The BCI field is moving fast with a number of promising outcomes that can significantly improve human lives.",
              "Researchers require regular updates to address challenges hindering further advancement of the BCI technology.",
              "More importantly, given the multidisciplinary nature of brain\u2013computer interface, scientists and engineers should work together to develop new and advanced BCI applications.",
              "Recently, the technology has found numerous industrial merits in a range of fields, including mining and education.",
              "Combined with fourth industrial revolution, researchers have demonstrated that BCI may accelerate the evolution of robots and neurophysiological discoveries [98, 99, 150].",
              "Other applications of the BCI technology include decoding of thoughts, extension of human memory, telepathy communication, automation and control, intelligence sharing, brain energy harvesting, and optimized (targeted) treatment of damaged body parts.",
              "The brain, being a complex human organ, generates and controls our thoughts and other physiological parameters: emotion, touch, breathing, hearing, motor skills, hunger, temperature, memory, and anger.",
              "Some parameters, such as anger and changes of breathing rate, may be manifested outside through physical expressions or actions.",
              "However, most parameters can only be manifested internally (inside the brain) without the knowledge of other people.",
              "The current technologies cannot, for example, predict with an acceptable accuracy the thoughts of an individual.",
              "While this internalization of human thoughts\u2014represented as brain signals in a BCI system\u2014may have advantages, some situations may demand us to accurately decode such thoughts.",
              "In criminology, for example, policemen would like to understand whether a suspected criminal speaks the truth.",

              "A second round of the game provides an additional chance for the Senders to evaluate the Receiver\u2019s decision and send feedback to the Receiver\u2019s brain, and for the Receiver to rectify a possible incorrect decision made in the first round.",
              "We evaluated the performance of BrainNet in terms of (1) Group-level performance during the game, (2) True/False positive rates of subjects\u2019 decisions, and (3) Mutual information between subjects.",

              "Furthermore, by varying the information reliability of the Senders by artificially injecting noise into one Sender\u2019s signal, we investigated how the Receiver learns to integrate noisy signals in order to make a correct decision.",
              "We found that like conventional social networks, BrainNet allows Receivers to learn to trust the Sender who is more reliable, in this case, based solely on the information transmitted directly to their brains.",
              "Our results point the way to future brain-to-brain interfaces that enable cooperative problem solving by humans using a \u201csocial network\u201d of connected brains.",
              "Direct brain-to-brain interfaces (BBIs) in humans1,2,3,4,5 are interfaces which combine neuroimaging and neurostimulation methods to extract and deliver information between brains, allowing direct brain-to-brain communication.",
              "A BBI extracts specific content from the neural signals of a \u201cSender\u201d brain, digitizes it, and delivers it to a \u201cReceiver\u201d brain.",
              "Because of ethical and safety considerations, existing human BBIs rely on non-invasive technologies, typically electroencephalography (EEG), to record neural activity and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to deliver information to the brain.",
              "For example, the first human BBI demonstrated by Rao and colleagues in 20132 decoded motor intention signals using EEG in the Sender and conveyed the intention via TMS directly to the motor cortex of the Receiver to complete a visual-motor task1.",
              "Stocco and colleagues5 extended these results by showing that a Sender and a Receiver can iteratively exchange information using a BBI to identify an unknown object from a list, using a question-and-answer paradigm akin to \u201c20 Questions.",
              "\u201d Grau and colleagues4 proposed a related but offline non-iterative BBI.",
              "Early interest in human BBIs came from the potential for expanding human communication and social interaction capabilities6,7,8,9,10.",
              "However, previous BBIs have lacked several key features of real-world human communication.",
              "First, the degree of interactivity has been minimal;",
              "for example, in the case of the \u201c20 Questions\u201d BBI5, the Sender only responds to the question the Receiver chooses, and the Receiver\u2019s performance does not affect the Sender\u2019s decision.",
              "Second, their interface required physical action: the Receiver touched the screen to select a question.",
              "Thus, the communication loop was completed via a motor output channel rather than a brain interface.",
              "Third, all past human BBIs have only allowed two subjects.",
              "Human communication, on the other hand, has become increasingly dominated by means such as social media that allow multiple parties to interact in a network.",
              "The potential for BBIs that allow interactions between multiple humans has previously been theorized3,11 but not demonstrated.",
              "Here, we present BrainNet (Fig.",
              "1), a next-generation BBI that addresses many of the limitations of past BBIs.",
              "First, BrainNet is designed to be a BBI for more than two human subjects;",
              "its current implementation allows two Senders and one Receiver to communicate, but it can be readily scaled up to include larger numbers of Senders.",
              "The Senders have the same role in observing the current state of the task and conveying their decisions to the Receiver.",
              "The Receiver has the role of integrating these independent decisions and deciding on a course of action.",
              "Second, BrainNet\u2019s design incorporates a second round of interactions between the Senders and the Receiver, so that the action of the Receiver in the first round can be perceived by the Senders, giving them a second chance to convey (potentially corrective) decisions to the Receiver.",
              "Third, the Receiver is equipped with both TMS (to receive Senders\u2019 decisions) and EEG (to perform an action in the task), thereby completely eliminating the need to use any physical movements to convey information.",
              "We report results from five groups, each with three human subjects (henceforth, \u201ctriad\u201d), who successfully used BrainNet to perform a collaborative task based on a Tetris-like game.",
              "Architecture of BrainNet.",
              "Two participants (\u201cSender 1\u201d and \u201cSender 2\u201d) each use a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on EEG to convey information about a collaborative task (here, a Tetris-like game) directly to the brain of the third participant (\u201cReceiver\u201d).",
              "Information from each Sender is transmitted over the internet to the Receiver\u2019s brain via a Computer-Brain Interface (CBI) based on TMS.",
              "After consciously processing the two inputs from the Senders, the Receiver uses a BCI based on EEG to execute an action in the task.",
              "The Senders see the result of this action on their screens (the same updated game state is shown on both screens, as indicated by the red arrow from one Sender\u2019s screen to the other).",
              "The Senders then have another opportunity to convey to the Receiver\u2019s brain new information to potentially rectify an incorrect choice in the first round.",
              "While our experiment only used two rounds, BrainNet allows an arbitrary number of interactions between the Senders and the Receiver as they collaborate to solve a task.",
              "BrainNet differs from a previous interface called \u201cBrainet\u201d12 which combines recordings from multiple monkey brains to perform a common motor task but is unidirectional and does not use stimulation to communicate information back to any of the brains.",
              "An important feature of communication in social networks is deciding which sources of information to pay attention to when deciding on a course of action13.",
              "To investigate whether BrainNet allows such a capability, we additionally explored whether the Receiver can learn the reliability of each Sender over the course of their brain-to-brain interactions.",
              "We varied the reliability of the information from one Sender compared to information from the other by injecting noise into the signals from one randomly chosen Sender.",

              "e., whose signal quality is not affected by our manipulation.",
              "To measure the direct brain-to-brain communication capabilities of BrainNet, we asked each triad of participants to perform 16 trials of an iterative Tetris-like game.",
              "In each trial, one participant, designated as the Receiver, is in charge of deciding whether or not to rotate a block before it drops to fill a gap in a line at the bottom of the screen.",
              "Critically, the Receiver is prevented from seeing the bottom part of the screen and must rely on the counsel of the other two participants, designated as the Senders, who can see the screen in its entirety.",
              "These Senders are tasked with making the correct decision (rotate or not) based on the shape of the current block and the gap at the bottom, and informing the Receiver of the decision via the brain-to-brain interface.",
              "All members of the triad communicate their decisions through an EEG-based interface using steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs;",
              "see Methods).",
              "The Senders\u2019 decisions are delivered to the Receiver through two TMS pulses delivered sequentially to the occipital cortex, eliciting a phosphene for a \u201cyes\u201d decision or no phosphene for a \u201cno\u201d rotation decision for each Sender (see Methods).",
              "Each trial is composed of two rounds: the first round is as described above;",
              "after the first round, the Senders are given the opportunity to examine the Receiver\u2019s decision, shown on their screen as the block (now potentially rotated) mid-way through its fall.",
              "The Senders are then given another chance to make new (possibly corrective) suggestions to the Receiver through the brain-to-brain interface.",
              "A successful completion of a trial thus requires accurate communication between the Senders and the Receiver across these two rounds (see Fig.",
              "2).",
              "Further, to examine the issue of reliability of the Senders, our software randomly chooses one Sender to be less reliable by making the decision sent to the Receiver from that Sender incorrect in ten out of sixteen trials.",
              "The order of trials requiring the block to be rotated and trials not requiring rotation was pseudo-randomized, with the constraint that each half of the session contained 4 rotation and 4 non-rotation trials.",
              "Trials 8\u201312 for the first triad were excluded from all analysis due to a problem with the timestamp routine.",

              "With large networks, difficult questions relating to the influence of individual network participants and individual and collective responsibility will arise.",
              "Also, complex implications on the users' concept of self and sense of identity may be expected, as discussed elsewhere (see Hildt, 2015).",
              "Furthermore, BBIs and multi-person BBI networks raise a number of autonomy related issues.",

              "Primarily, through the risk that information retrieved from individual brains is distributed widely among the network without the individual's agreement.",
              "It will be crucial that all participants in BBI networks participate voluntarily and give their free and informed consent.",
              "A precondition for informed consent is that all individuals\u2014both senders and recipients\u2014are aware of what type of signals are recorded, collected, transferred, and received, and what the implications may be.",
              "This requires informed consent forms not only to delineate the technical details but also to describe possible implications on privacy, agency, and identity.",
              "All of this may be difficult to achieve, however.",
              "On the side of the sender, informed consent requires that senders are able to control the type and amount of brain signals to be recorded and transferred.",
              "One option may be to choose very specific brain signals and thus limit BBI functionality\u2014as was done in the Jiang et al.",
              "study with the use of a binary signal.",
              "With more volatile BBIs such as those involving fMRI, the situation will be much more complex and it will be much more difficult to ensure the senders' autonomy.",
              "For autonomy reasons, it may be necessary to limit the volatility of BBIs and the spectrum of technologies used.",
              "Privacy issues arise when a person's brain data is recorded and used, and the person is not aware of it or does not want the data to be recorded, transformed or distributed.",
              "This is particularly relevant when the data allows for conclusions to be drawn on the individual's condition or mental states.",
              "Regarding the question of how to regulate neuroscience and neurotechnology, Ienca and Andorno argue in favor of a \u201cright to brain privacy,\u201d which \u201caims to protect people against illegitimate access to their brain information and to prevent the indiscriminate leakage of brain data across the infosphere\u201d (Ienca and Andorno, 2017, p.",
              "15).",
              "They point out that brain data retrieved from a person's brain can be considered to be \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d that deserves protection.",
              "With regard to privacy protection, current and also possible future advanced techniques to identify individuals have to be taken into consideration (see Rocher et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "In order to protect individuals from unknowingly giving away sensitive information in BBIs and similar systems, there is a clear need to increase awareness of autonomy and privacy issues related to brain signals, to be transparent about what data is recorded and used and what the implications of this may be.",
              "On the side of the receiver, individual autonomy requires that participants in multi-brain BBIs are able to control what type of information they want to receive, from whom, and when.",
              "Especially when it comes to large brain networks, a mechanism will be required to reduce noise, limit input, and suppress unwanted senders.",
              "With large networks, something similar to \u201clike buttons\u201d or \u201cdislike buttons\u201d in current social media might be imaginable, with which receivers may be able to block or reduce certain types of transmissions or senders.",
              "Interestingly, the study published by Jiang et al.",
              "already investigated this principle, i.",
              "e., the possibility for receivers to \u201cweigh\u201d the relevance of a sender and to rely more heavily on preferred senders.",
              "Can receivers in BBI networks be harmed?",
              "While the signals transferred will influence their neural computation, it is unclear right now what the implications could be and whether there is a risk of overstimulation.",
              "The risks will vary considerably, depending on the technology used, the type of signal transferred, and the type of network.",
              "Also, questions related to identity have to be considered here, especially in more volatile BBIs (Hildt, 2015).",
              "Several authors have suggested a \u201cright to mental integrity\u201d that allows individuals to protect their brains from potential harm (Ienca and Andorno, 2017;",
              "Lavazza, 2018).",
              "In case of potential harm, such a right could allow receivers to limit brain input in BBIs.",
              "However, on the receiver side, much more flexibility could be achieved by referring to individual autonomy and informed consent.",
              "These concepts would not be confined to protect from potential harm but would also include protection from any kind of unwanted signal.",
              "Additional autonomy related questions arise as participants in BBI networks depend heavily on other network members and the input they provide.",
              "The role of recipients is to rely on the inputs received, to find out who are the most reliable senders, and to make decisions based on the inputs and past experiences.",
              "In this, a lot of uncertainty and guessing will be involved, especially as it will often be unclear where the input or information originally came from.",
              "For recipients in brain networks, individual or autonomous decision-making seems very difficult if not almost impossible.",
              "This is problematic in itself, not just in view of the possibility of fake news or brain hacking (Ienca and Haselager, 2016).",
              "A concept of \u201cextended autonomy\u201d may be conceivable here, related to the idea of extended mind and cognition (see Clark and Chalmers, 1998).",
              "Furthermore, the possibility to negotiate joint commitment, similar to what is normally done through language communication, will be crucial for collective BBI-based agency (Gilbert, 1990;",
              "Dingemanse, 2017).",
              "BBIs and BBI networks are not science-fiction any more, they are technically feasible in principle, even though at present, BBI research clearly is in its infancy.",
              "BBIs come along with a number of currently unresolved ethical issues including autonomy, privacy, agency, accountability, and identity.",
              "While it is questionable whether multi-person BBIs will have broad applications in the near future, some very specific uses seem conceivable.",
              "If research is to continue in this field, there is a clear need to start thinking right now about how to responsibly shape the development and future use of BBIs and direct brain communication.",
              "A first step in this process could be to have an interdisciplinary team of researchers develop recommendations or guidelines, possibly using a recent Portuguese document (Pais-Vieira and Pais-Vieira, 2018) as one of the starting points.",
