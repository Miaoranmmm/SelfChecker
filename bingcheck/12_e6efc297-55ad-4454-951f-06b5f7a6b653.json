              "Our descriptive timeline is partitioned into four historical parts, Geological, Cultural, Western, and GBRs own history.",
              "The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is considered the youngest reef system in the world with itsA\u0302 earliest beginning around 600,000 years ago and the modern GBR forming only 9,500 years ago.",
              "Coral reefs are limestone structures (Calcium carbonate structures) produced by living organisms. The first reef building corals appeared over 500 million years ago, with modern corals or stony corals emerging only 240 million years ago.",
              "So why is the world\u2019s largest coral reef system so young?",
              "A\u0302 The corals that exist today are thought to have evolved in the ancient Tethys Sea between Laurasia and Gondwanaland.",
              "As continental drift caused these continents to separate, the Tethys Sea began to close, and the widely dispersed evolving corals were slowly pushed eastward and concentrated in what is now the western Pacific Ocean.",
              "This is thought to have contributed to the high diversity of corals in the region today.",
              "Today this region contains more than 76% of coral species and is known as the coral triangle.",
              "The Coral Triangle is an area of highly biodiverse reef systems located between Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea.",
              "Continental drift also accounts for the late start of the Great Barrier Reef 600 000 years ago.",
              "Around 65 million years ago Australia, a rainforest dominated continent, was connected to Antarctica and was positioned further South than its current position.",
              "At this time, the continents began to split and Australia drifted North to its current position.",
              "Around 20 million years ago Queensland had nearly reached its current position and the continent was drying out and only remnants of the old rainforest were remaining.",
              "The extension of the Qld Plateau or continental shelf (long, wide, and shallow) along the coastline provided a perfect stable substrate for corals to thrive.",
              "However, corals were not recorded to flourish at this time.",
              "Cool water temperatures and poor visibility have been suggested as the main reasons for this.",
              "This changed at ~ 600,000 years ago, the northernmost parts of the Great Barrier Reef began to form as the area was now within a warmer climate.",
              "Coral larvae settled on the ocean floor and began to grow.",
              "It is also thought that the continental movements allowed the East Australian Current to bring warm water and coral larvae onto the northern parts of the continental shelf, contributing to increasing coral growth.",
              "More recently, the formation of the Great Barrier Reef was driven by Sea Level and Climatic changes.",
              "Over the last 500,000 years the reef has developed as sea level has risen and fallen over multiple glacial (ice ages) and interglacial cycles (warmer periods).",
              "In a glacial period as ice forms at polar caps and in glaciers, sea level falls, while in interglacial periods ice melts causing sea level to rise once more.",
              "During these cycles sea level could change at a rate up to 5m per thousand years.",
              "The difference in sea level between interglacial periods was up to 120m.",
              "These differences caused drastic differences in marine habitats.",
              "For example, during the ice age around 18,000 years ago, people living in the region where Cairns city is now would have had to travel 60km to reach the coastline.",
              "A\u0302 This also meant that Fitzroy Island was part of the mainland.",
              "During periods of high sea level, when the continental shelf was inundated, corals were able to grow in the warm shallow waters and create reefs.",
              "During these periods, reefs accumulated at rates more than 10m per thousand years.",
              "The formation of the Great Barrier Reef has occurred throughout many such periods of reef growth.",
              "It is important to understand that reef growth only occurred during periods where conditions were conducive to coral growth and reef formation.",
              "It is estimated that corala\u0302\u0080\u0099s have only been exposed to conditions suitable for reef formation for ~10% of the ecological time between the last two interglacial periods.",
              "The short period in which the Great Barrier Reef formed makes the huge biodiversity even more remarkable.",
              "The great barrier reef as we know it developed during the last period of sea level rise which began around 9,500 years ago.",

              "The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is considered the youngest reef system in the world with itsA\u0302 earliest beginning around 600,000 years ago and the modern GBR forming only 9,500 years ago.",
              "Coral reefs are limestone structures (Calcium carbonate structures) produced by living organisms. The first reef building corals appeared over 500 million years ago, with modern corals or stony corals emerging only 240 million years ago.",
              "So why is the world\u2019s largest coral reef system so young?",
              "A\u0302 The corals that exist today are thought to have evolved in the ancient Tethys Sea between Laurasia and Gondwanaland.",
              "As continental drift caused these continents to separate, the Tethys Sea began to close, and the widely dispersed evolving corals were slowly pushed eastward and concentrated in what is now the western Pacific Ocean.",
              "This is thought to have contributed to the high diversity of corals in the region today.",
              "Today this region contains more than 76% of coral species and is known as the coral triangle.",
              "The Coral Triangle is an area of highly biodiverse reef systems located between Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea.",
              "Continental drift also accounts for the late start of the Great Barrier Reef 600 000 years ago.",
              "Around 65 million years ago Australia, a rainforest dominated continent, was connected to Antarctica and was positioned further South than its current position.",
              "At this time, the continents began to split and Australia drifted North to its current position.",
              "Around 20 million years ago Queensland had nearly reached its current position and the continent was drying out and only remnants of the old rainforest were remaining.",
              "The extension of the Qld Plateau or continental shelf (long, wide, and shallow) along the coastline provided a perfect stable substrate for corals to thrive.",
              "However, corals were not recorded to flourish at this time.",
              "Cool water temperatures and poor visibility have been suggested as the main reasons for this.",
              "This changed at ~ 600,000 years ago, the northernmost parts of the Great Barrier Reef began to form as the area was now within a warmer climate.",
              "Coral larvae settled on the ocean floor and began to grow.",
              "It is also thought that the continental movements allowed the East Australian Current to bring warm water and coral larvae onto the northern parts of the continental shelf, contributing to increasing coral growth.",
              "More recently, the formation of the Great Barrier Reef was driven by Sea Level and Climatic changes.",
              "Over the last 500,000 years the reef has developed as sea level has risen and fallen over multiple glacial (ice ages) and interglacial cycles (warmer periods).",
              "In a glacial period as ice forms at polar caps and in glaciers, sea level falls, while in interglacial periods ice melts causing sea level to rise once more.",
              "During these cycles sea level could change at a rate up to 5m per thousand years.",
              "The difference in sea level between interglacial periods was up to 120m.",
              "These differences caused drastic differences in marine habitats.",
              "For example, during the ice age around 18,000 years ago, people living in the region where Cairns city is now would have had to travel 60km to reach the coastline.",
              "A\u0302 This also meant that Fitzroy Island was part of the mainland.",
              "During periods of high sea level, when the continental shelf was inundated, corals were able to grow in the warm shallow waters and create reefs.",
              "During these periods, reefs accumulated at rates more than 10m per thousand years.",
              "The formation of the Great Barrier Reef has occurred throughout many such periods of reef growth.",
              "It is important to understand that reef growth only occurred during periods where conditions were conducive to coral growth and reef formation.",
              "It is estimated that corala\u0302\u0080\u0099s have only been exposed to conditions suitable for reef formation for ~10% of the ecological time between the last two interglacial periods.",
              "The short period in which the Great Barrier Reef formed makes the huge biodiversity even more remarkable.",
              "The great barrier reef as we know it developed during the last period of sea level rise which began around 9,500 years ago.",
              "It is estimated that the primary reef growth began around 9,000 years ago and continued until approximately 4,000 \u2013 5,000 years ago.",
              "For the most part, the sea level on the Great Barrier Reef has been relatively stable for the last 6000 years, allowing the Great Barrier Reef to continue developing to what is present today.",
              "The geological processes that have isolated populations for thousands of years are probably still in progress today.",
              "These factors have driven evolution along with the GBR connection to coral triangle via Torres Straits and are possible explanations why the GBR is one of the most diverse coral reefs in the world.",
              "While we may house one of the youngest reefs in the world, we are home to the oldest living culture in the world dating back at least 60,000 years.",
              "During this time, the coastline has undergone many changes and there is evidence that Aboriginal peoples were living on the land that has since become the Great Barrier Reef.",
              "These lands consisted of various ecosystems such as plains, rainforest, coastal fringes, mangrove forests and remnants of old reefs.",
              "A\u0302 While the fauna of the time consisted of a giant kangaroo, the Procoptodon that stood 2 meters tall and the giant wombat the Diprotodon that stood 2 meters high and was three meters in length.",
              "During the last Ice age ~ 18,000 years ago, the Traditional Owners remained connected to the land and the sea.",
              "As sea level rose Aboriginal People began a westward retreat to what is now the east coast of Australia.",
              "These major environmental changes were recorded in Dreaming stories or Dreamtime which provides insight into a vastly different landscape, for example, Fitzroy Island and Double Island were part of the mainland.",
              "A\u0302 There is a long history of Traditional Owners travelling to the islands and coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef.",
              "They built sheet bark and dugout canoes to move around their sea country.",
              "There is evidence of use of most of the islands in the GBR at varying times over the last 10,000 years.",
              "Islands were used for social, ceremonial, and political reasons as well as for hunting fish, turtles, dugongs, and gathering shell meat and crustaceans.",
              "There are more than 70 individual Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Traditional Owner groups with links to the Great Barrier Reef.",
              "There is evidence of permanent occupation of islands by these groups such as extensive fish traps and shell middens.",
              "Stone artifacts such as weapons, spears and tools provide the best evidence of interactions between island and coastal groups.",
              "Stones from South Molle Island were distributed more than 170km along the Queensland coastline.",
              "More recent evidence also shows that Great Barrier Reef Traditional Owner groups had extensive seafaring knowledge and established trade routes reaching the South Pacific Islands.",
              "During the 1800a\u0302\u0080\u0099s interactions occurred between the Traditional Owners of the GBR and the early explorers and settlers that travelled North to setup industries.",
              "These first industries included Beche-De-Mer, Red Cedar and Gold.",
              "With these interactions began the dispossession of land, disruption of culture and exploitation of Indigenous people.",
              "No doubt this was a terrible time for Indigenous communities with countless lives being lost and their connection to country and culture was being seriously fragmented and potentially lost forever.",
              "During this time some individuals (explorers, early settlers and missionaries) had compassion and admiration for the nomadic North Queensland Traditional Owners culture and documented their findings.",
              "From their works there was a real appreciation of the local Indigenous culture in the Cairns Region for several aspects including:A\u0302 Today, Traditional Owner groups are involved in the management of their Sea Country in partnership with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority through the Indigenous Land & Sea Country partnerships program.",
              "This combines modern management with Traditional Owner knowledge to protect the World Heritage Great Barrier Reef.",
              "Along the Great Barrier Reef.",
              "A working facet of this joint management is the Traditional Use of Marine Resource Agreements (TUMRAs).",
              "These agreements are acknowledgement of the Traditional Owners to manage their Country and today over a quarter of the Marine Park coastline is managed by a TUMRA.",
              "The first TUMRA was developed by the Girringun Aboriginal Corporation in 2005, there are now 9 agreements in place across the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.",
              "In the Cairns region the Gunggandji and Yirrganydji People have TUMRAs.",
              "Around 400 years ago, the first European to sail the waters of the Great Barrier Reef was Luis Vaez de Torres.",
              "He commanded the San Pedro through the Northern Great Barrier Reef in 1606.",
              "After becoming separated from a Spanish expedition, he narrowly missed Northern Australia sailing through the Torres Strait which is named after him.",
              "A\u0302 However, Captain James Cook recorded the first written descriptions of the Great Barrier Reef in his journal during a voyage in 1770.",
              "Aboard HM Endeavour he sailed up the east coast of Australia.",
