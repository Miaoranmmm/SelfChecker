              "She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.",
              "Ada Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Lady Byron.",
              "[2] All Lovelace's half-siblings, Lord Byron's other children, were born out of wedlock to other women.",
              "[3] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever.",
              "He died in Greece when Ada was eight.",
              "Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity.",

              "King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.",
              "Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education.",

              "Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by the military engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of seven notes, simply called \"Notes\".",
              "Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine.",
              "Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.",
              "[6][better source needed] She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.",
              "[7] Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.",

              "[23] This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother's influence, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends.",

              "From 1845, the family's main house was Horsley Towers, built in the Tudorbethan fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Charles Barry,[25][26] and later greatly enlarged to Lovelace's own designs.",

              "Immediately after the birth of Annabella, Lady King experienced \"a tedious and suffering illness, which took months to cure\".",
              "[24] Ada was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace and in 1838, her husband was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham, meaning Ada became the Countess of Lovelace.",
              "[27] In 1843\u201344, Ada's mother assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Ada's children and to act as a \"moral\" instructor for Ada.",
              "[28] He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections, claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an \"unbecoming\" manner.",
              "When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it off.",
              "[29] In 1841, Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the daughter of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) were told by Ada's mother that Ada's father was also Medora's father.",
              "[30] On 27 February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: \"I am not in the least astonished.",

              "[31] She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: \"I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was.\"",
              "[32] In the 1840s, Ada flirted with scandals: firstly, from a relaxed approach to extra-marital relationships with men, leading to rumours of affairs;",
              "[33] and secondly, from her love of gambling.",
              "She apparently lost more than \u00a33,000 on the horses during the later 1840s.",
              "[34] The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets.",
              "This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband.",
              "[35] She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards.",
              "John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement.",
              "She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her.",
              "[36] During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.",
              "[37] From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,[22] and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life.",
              "[38] Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age.",
              "She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King,[a] and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author.",
              "In the 1840s, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her \"much help in her mathematical studies\" including study of advanced calculus topics including the \"numbers of Bernoulli\" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine).",
              "[39] In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill in mathematics might lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".",
              "[40] Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating poetry and science.",
              "Whilst studying differential calculus, she wrote to De Morgan: I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies.",

              "In our recent book, Ada Lovelace: The Making of a Computer Scientist, we show, based upon manuscripts held by the Bodleian Library in Oxford, how she developed the mathematical skills and knowledge she needed to write the paper.",
              "Charles Babbage started work on his Analytical Engine in the mid-1830s, with the idea of creating a new calculating machine that could \u201ceat its own tail\u201d, by which he meant that it could modify its calculation while it was running.",
              "It would do this by pausing during a calculation, and using the values it had already determined to choose between two possible next steps.",
              "Babbage listed the basic operations that such a machine, with a large enough memory, would need if it were to execute \u201cthe whole of the developments and operations of analysis\u201d, in other words any calculation that could be conceived of at the time.",
              "We now know that the basic operations that he described are what are needed to compute anything that can be calculated by any modern computer.",
              "This means that the Analytical Engine would have been, in modern terms, a general-purpose computer, a concept first identified by Alan Turing in the 1930s.",
              "The Analytical Engine was never built, but many aspects of its design were recorded in immaculate detail in Babbage\u2019s drawings and mechanical notation.",
              "It was to be programmed by means of punched cards, similar to those used in the weaving looms designed by Joseph Marie Jacquard.",
              "Separate decks of cards made up what we would now call the program, and gave the starting values for the computations.",
              "A complex mechanism allowed the machine to repeat a deck of cards, so as to execute a loop.",
              "The hardware involved many new and intricate mechanisms and was conceived on a massive scale.",
              "The central processing unit, which Babbage called the Mill, would be fifteen feet (4.",
              "5m) tall;",

              "In 1840, Italian scientists invited him to Turin, where he lectured on the principles of the Engine.",
              "In the audience was Luigi Menabrea, who in October 1842 published the first account of the Engine, in French, based on Babbage\u2019s lectures.",

              "After several months of furious effort by them both, the resulting paper was published in Taylor\u2019s Scientific Memoirs in August 1843.",

              "11 The paper is most famous for the final appendix, Note G.",
              "This demonstrates the operation of the machine by giving the example of the calculation of the so-called \u2018Bernoulli numbers\u2019, which crop up in many places in modern mathematics.",
              "The Bernoulli numbers are particularly amenable to machine calculation because they are defined recursively: we may use the first to determine the second, the second for the third, and so on.",
              "There are several different ways of calculating these numbers, and Lovelace did not choose the simplest: she noted instead that the \u201cobject is not simplicity or facility of computation, but the illustration of the powers of the engine\u201d.",
              "The paper contained a detailed explanation of how the various quantities involved in the computation of the Bernoulli numbers are fetched from the Store, used in calculation in the Mill, and moved back again, according to the instructions on the cards.",
              "The process is illustrated using a large table, whose columns represent the values of the data, the variables, and the intermediate results, as the engine carried out each stage of the calculation.",
              "This table is often described as \u201cthe first computer program\u201d, though Lovelace wrote, more accurately, that it \u201cpresents a complete simultaneous view of all the successive changes\u201d in the components of the machine, as the calculation progresses.",
              "In other words, the table is what computer scientists would now call an \u201cexecution trace\u201d.",
              "The \u201cprogram\u201d, had the idea existed at the time, would have been the deck of punched cards that caused the machine to make those successive changes.",
              "Babbage\u2019s designs were rather unclear about aspects of how the cards would be manipulated, so it is hard to reconstruct the exact program.",
              "Such tables were still used as a method for explaining computation 100 years later, when Geoff Toothill drew a similar diagram to illustrate the working of the first stored program computer, the \u201cManchester Baby\u201d.",
              "\u2018Note G\u2019 is the culmination of Lovelace\u2019s paper, following many pages of detailed explanation of the operation of the Engine and the cards, and the notation of the tables.",
              "The paper shows Lovelace\u2019s obsessive attention to mathematical detail \u2013 it also shows her imagination in thinking about the bigger picture.",
              "She observed a fundamental principle of the machine, that the operations, defined by the cards, are separate from the data and the results.",
              "Famously, she observed that the machine might act upon things other than number, if those things satisfied mathematical rules.",
              "\u201cSupposing\u201d, she wrote \u201cthat the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.",
              "\u201d She thought about how the engine might do algebra, how it \u201cweaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves\u201d and how it might make new discoveries: \u201cWe might even invent laws for series or formul\u00e6 in an arbitrary manner, and set the engine to work upon them, and thus deduce numerical results which we might not otherwise have thought of obtaining.",
              "\u201d These led her to think about what we now call artificial intelligence, though she argued that the engine was not capable of original ideas: \u201cThe Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything.",

              "\u201d Alan Turing disagreed.",

              "Lovelace\u2019s thoughts about using the machine are very familiar to present-day programmers.",

              "\u201d And, echoing a concern of every programmer ever, she also appreciated the need to \u201creduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the calculation\u201d.",
              "Lovelace\u2019s paper is an extraordinary accomplishment, probably understood and recognised by very few in its time, yet still perfectly understandable nearly two centuries later.",

              "In 1843 Lovelace translated a French paper that Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea wrote about the Analytical Engine.",
              "She also added thousands of words of her own notes to the paper.",

              "She even speculated that the Analytical Engine could be used to perform operations on \"other things besides number,\" such as musical notes.",
              "Only a small piece of the Analytical Engine was ever built, and Ada Lovelace died in 1852.",

              "Their explanations were only transitional, being picked up and broadened by Michael Faraday.",
              "The phenomena are now part of the theory of eddy currents, and Babbage and Herschel missed some of the clues to unification of electromagnetic theory, staying close to Ampe\u0300re's force law.",
              "[29] Babbage purchased the actuarial tables of George Barrett, who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work, and surveyed the field in 1826 in Comparative View of the Various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives.",
              "[30] This interest followed a project to set up an insurance company, prompted by Francis Baily and mooted in 1824, but not carried out.",
              "[31] Babbage did calculate actuarial tables for that scheme, using Equitable Society mortality data from 1762 onwards.",
              "[32] During this whole period, Babbage depended awkwardly on his father's support, given his father's attitude to his early marriage, of 1814: he and Edward Ryan wedded the Whitmore sisters.",
              "He made a home in Marylebone in London and established a large family.",
              "[33] On his father's death in 1827, Babbage inherited a large estate (value around \u00a3100,000, equivalent to \u00a39.",

              "[34] Babbage was instrumental in founding the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820, initially known as the Astronomical Society of London.",
              "[35] Its original aims were to reduce astronomical calculations to a more standard form, and to circulate data.",
              "[36] These directions were closely connected with Babbage's ideas on computation, and in 1824 he won its Gold Medal, cited \"for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables\".",
              "[37] Babbage's motivation to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation had been a commonplace since Dionysius Lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the Edinburgh Review (under Babbage's guidance).",
              "[38][39] The context of these developments is still debated.",
              "Babbage's own account of the origin of the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society's wish to improve The Nautical Almanac.",
              "Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, to recalculate some part of those tables.",
              "With the results to hand, discrepancies were found.",
              "This was in 1821 or 1822, and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation.",
              "[40] The issue of the Nautical Almanac is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks, who had died in 1820.",
              "[41] Babbage studied the requirements to establish a modern postal system, with his friend Thomas Frederick Colby, concluding there should be a uniform rate that was put into effect with the introduction of the Uniform Fourpenny Post supplanted by the Uniform Penny Post[42] in 1839 and 1840.",
              "Colby was another of the founding group of the Society.",
              "[43] He was also in charge of the Survey of Ireland.",
              "Herschel and Babbage were present at a celebrated operation of that survey, the remeasuring of the Lough Foyle baseline.",
              "[44] The Analytical Society had initially been no more than an undergraduate provocation.",
              "During this period it had some more substantial achievements.",
              "In 1816 Babbage, Herschel and Peacock published a translation from French of the lectures of Sylvestre Lacroix, which was then the state-of-the-art calculus textbook.",
              "[45] Reference to Lagrange in calculus terms marks out the application of what are now called formal power series.",
              "British mathematicians had used them from about 1730 to 1760.",
              "As re-introduced, they were not simply applied as notations in differential calculus.",
              "They opened up the fields of functional equations (including the difference equations fundamental to the difference engine) and operator (D-module) methods for differential equations.",
              "The analogy of difference and differential equations was notationally changing \u0394 to D, as a \"finite\" difference becomes \"infinitesimal\".",
              "These symbolic directions became popular, as operational calculus, and pushed to the point of diminishing returns.",
              "The Cauchy concept of limit was kept at bay.",
              "[46] Woodhouse had already founded this second \"British Lagrangian School\" with its treatment of Taylor series as formal.",
              "[47] In this context function composition is complicated to express, because the chain rule is not simply applied to second and higher derivatives.",
              "This matter was known to Woodhouse by 1803, who took from Louis Franc\u0327ois Antoine Arbogast what is now called Faa\u0300 di Bruno's formula.",
              "In essence it was known to Abraham De Moivre (1697).",
              "Herschel found the method impressive, Babbage knew of it, and it was later noted by Ada Lovelace as compatible with the analytical engine.",
              "[48] In the period to 1820 Babbage worked intensively on functional equations in general, and resisted both conventional finite differences and Arbogast's approach (in which \u0394 and D were related by the simple additive case of the exponential map).",
              "But via Herschel he was influenced by Arbogast's ideas in the matter of iteration, i.",
              "e. composing a function with itself, possibly many times.",
              "[47] Writing in a major paper on functional equations in the Philosophical Transactions (1815/6), Babbage said his starting point was work of Gaspard Monge.",
              "[49] From 1828 to 1839, Babbage was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge.",
              "Not a conventional resident don, and inattentive to his teaching responsibilities, he wrote three topical books during this period of his life.",
              "He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832.",
              "[50] Babbage was out of sympathy with colleagues: George Biddell Airy, his predecessor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge,[51] thought an issue should be made of his lack of interest in lecturing.",
              "Babbage planned to lecture in 1831 on political economy.",
              "Babbage's reforming direction looked to see university education more inclusive, universities doing more for research, a broader syllabus and more interest in applications;",
              "but William Whewell found the programme unacceptable.",
              "A controversy Babbage had with Richard Jones lasted for six years.",
              "[52] He never did give a lecture.",
              "[53] It was during this period that Babbage tried to enter politics.",
              "Simon Schaffer writes that his views of the 1830s included disestablishment of the Church of England, a broader political franchise, and inclusion of manufacturers as stakeholders.",
              "[54] He twice stood for Parliament as a candidate for the borough of Finsbury.",
              "In 1832 he came in third among five candidates, missing out by some 500 votes in the two-member constituency when two other reformist candidates, Thomas Wakley and Christopher Temple, split the vote.",
              "[55][56] In his memoirs Babbage related how this election brought him the friendship of Samuel Rogers: his brother Henry Rogers wished to support Babbage again, but died within days.",
              "[57] In 1834 Babbage finished last among four.",
              "[58][59][60] In 1832, Babbage, Herschel and Ivory were appointed Knights of the Royal Guelphic Order, however they were not subsequently made knights bachelor to entitle them to the prefix Sir, which often came with appointments to that foreign order (though Herschel was later created a baronet).",
              "[61] Babbage now emerged as a polemicist.",
              "One of his biographers notes that all his books contain a \"campaigning element\".",
              "His Reflections on the Decline of Science and some of its Causes (1830) stands out, however, for its sharp attacks.",
              "It aimed to improve British science, and more particularly to oust Davies Gilbert as President of the Royal Society, which Babbage wished to reform.",
              "[62] It was written out of pique, when Babbage hoped to become the junior secretary of the Royal Society, as Herschel was the senior, but failed because of his antagonism to Humphry Davy.",
              "[63] Michael Faraday had a reply written, by Gerrit Moll, as On the Alleged Decline of Science in England (1831).",
              "[64] On the front of the Royal Society Babbage had no impact, with the bland election of the Duke of Sussex to succeed Gilbert the same year.",
              "As a broad manifesto, on the other hand, his Decline led promptly to the formation in 1831 of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS).",
              "[64] The Mechanics' Magazine in 1831 identified as Declinarians the followers of Babbage.",
              "In an unsympathetic tone it pointed out David Brewster writing in the Quarterly Review as another leader;",
              "with the barb that both Babbage and Brewster had received public money.",
              "[65] In the debate of the period on statistics (qua data collection) and what is now statistical inference, the BAAS in its Statistical Section (which owed something also to Whewell) opted for data collection.",
              "This Section was the sixth, established in 1833 with Babbage as chairman and John Elliot Drinkwater as secretary.",
              "The foundation of the Statistical Society followed.",
              "[66][67][68] Babbage was its public face, backed by Richard Jones and Robert Malthus.",
              "[69] Babbage published On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures (1832), on the organisation of industrial production.",
              "It was an influential early work of operational research.",
              "[71] John Rennie the Younger in addressing the Institution of Civil Engineers on manufacturing in 1846 mentioned mostly surveys in encyclopaedias, and Babbage's book was first an article in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana, the form in which Rennie noted it, in the company of related works by John Farey Jr.",
              ", Peter Barlow and Andrew Ure.",
              "[72] From An essay on the general principles which regulate the application of machinery to manufactures and the mechanical arts (1827), which became the Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana article of 1829, Babbage developed the schematic classification of machines that, combined with discussion of factories, made up the first part of the book.",
              "The second part considered the \"domestic and political economy\" of manufactures.",
              "[73] The book sold well, and quickly went to a fourth edition (1836).",
              "[74] Babbage represented his work as largely a result of actual observations in factories, British and abroad.",
              "It was not, in its first edition, intended to address deeper questions of political economy;",
              "the second (late 1832) did, with three further chapters including one on piece rate.",
              "[75] The book also contained ideas on rational design in factories, and profit sharing.",
              "[76] In Economy of Machinery was described what is now called the \"Babbage principle\".",
              "It pointed out commercial advantages available with more careful division of labour.",
              "As Babbage himself noted, it had already appeared in the work of Melchiorre Gioia in 1815.",
              "[77] The term was introduced in 1974 by Harry Braverman.",
              "[78] Related formulations are the \"principle of multiples\" of Philip Sargant Florence, and the \"balance of processes\".",
              "[79][80] What Babbage remarked is that skilled workers typically spend parts of their time performing tasks that are below their skill level.",
              "If the labour process can be divided among several workers, labour costs may be cut by assigning only high-skill tasks to high-cost workers, restricting other tasks to lower-paid workers.",
              "[81] He also pointed out that training or apprenticeship can be taken as fixed costs;",
              "but that returns to scale are available by his approach of standardisation of tasks, therefore again favouring the factory system.",
              "[82] His view of human capital was restricted to minimising the time period for recovery of training costs.",
              "[83] Another aspect of the work was its detailed breakdown of the cost structure of book publishing.",
              "Babbage took the unpopular line, from the publishers' perspective, of exposing the trade's profitability.",
              "[84] He went as far as to name the organisers of the trade's restrictive practices.",
              "[85] Twenty years later he attended a meeting hosted by John Chapman to campaign against the Booksellers Association, still a cartel.",
              "[86] It has been written that \"what Arthur Young was to agriculture, Charles Babbage was to the factory visit and machinery\".",
              "[87] Babbage's theories are said to have influenced the layout of the 1851 Great Exhibition,[88] and his views had a strong effect on his contemporary George Julius Poulett Scrope.",
              "[89] Karl Marx argued that the source of the productivity of the factory system was exactly the combination of the division of labour with machinery, building on Adam Smith, Babbage and Ure.",
              "[90] Where Marx picked up on Babbage and disagreed with Smith was on the motivation for division of labour by the manufacturer: as Babbage did, he wrote that it was for the sake of profitability, rather than productivity, and identified an impact on the concept of a trade.",
              "[91] John Ruskin went further, to oppose completely what manufacturing in Babbage's sense stood for.",
              "[92] Babbage also affected the economic thinking of John Stuart Mill.",
              "[93] George Holyoake saw Babbage's detailed discussion of profit sharing as substantive, in the tradition of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier, if requiring the attentions of a benevolent captain of industry, and ignored at the time.",
              "[94] Works by Babbage and Ure were published in French translation in 1830;",
              "[95] On the Economy of Machinery was translated in 1833 into French by E\u0301douard Biot, and into German the same year by Gottfried Friedenberg.",
              "[96] The French engineer and writer on industrial organisation Le\u0301on Lalanne was influenced by Babbage, but also by the economist Claude Lucien Bergery, in reducing the issues to \"technology\".",
              "[97] William Jevons connected Babbage's \"economy of labour\" with his own labour experiments of 1870.",
              "[98] The Babbage principle is an inherent assumption in Frederick Winslow Taylor's scientific management.",
              "[99] Mary Everest Boole claimed that there was profound influence \u2013 via her uncle George Everest \u2013 of Indian thought in general and Indian logic, in particular, on Babbage and on her husband George Boole, as well as on Augustus De Morgan: Think what must have been the effect of the intense Hinduizing of three such men as Babbage, De Morgan, and George Boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830\u201365.",
              "What share had it in generating the Vector Analysis and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted?",
              "[100] In 1837, responding to the series of eight Bridgewater Treatises, Babbage published his Ninth Bridgewater Treatise, under the title On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation.",
              "In this work Babbage weighed in on the side of uniformitarianism in a current debate.",

              "[102] The book is a work of natural theology, and incorporates extracts from related correspondence of Herschel with Charles Lyell.",
              "[103] Babbage put forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator.",
              "In this book, Babbage dealt with relating interpretations between science and religion;",
              "on the one hand, he insisted that \"there exists no fatal collision between the words of Scripture and the facts of nature;\"",
              "on the other hand, he wrote that the Book of Genesis was not meant to be read literally in relation to scientific terms. Against those who said these were in conflict, he wrote \"that the contradiction they have imagined can have no real existence, and that whilst the testimony of Moses remains unimpeached, we may also be permitted to confide in the testimony of our senses.\"",

              "[107] Mary Everest Boole argues that Babbage was introduced to Indian thought in the 1820s by her uncle George Everest: Some time about 1825, [Everest] came to England for two or three years, and made a fast and lifelong friendship with Herschel and with Babbage, who was then quite young.",
              "I would ask any fair-minded mathematician to read Babbage's Ninth Bridgewater Treatise and compare it with the works of his contemporaries in England;",
              "and then ask himself whence came the peculiar conception of the nature of miracle which underlies Babbage's ideas of Singular Points on Curves (Chap, viii) \u2013 from European Theology or Hindu Metaphysic?",

              "how the English clergy of that day hated Babbage's book!",

              "[108] He explained: My excellent mother taught me the usual forms of my daily and nightly prayer;",
              "and neither in my father nor my mother was there any mixture of bigotry and intolerance on the one hand, nor on the other of that unbecoming and familiar mode of addressing the Almighty which afterwards so much disgusted me in my youthful years.",
              "[109] Rejecting the Athanasian Creed as a \"direct contradiction in terms\", in his youth he looked to Samuel Clarke's works on religion, of which Being and Attributes of God (1704) exerted a particularly strong influence on him.",

              "[110] In his autobiography Passages from the Life of a Philosopher (1864), Babbage wrote a whole chapter on the topic of religion, where he identified three sources of divine knowledge:[111] He stated, on the basis of the design argument, that studying the works of nature had been the more appealing evidence, and the one which led him to actively profess the existence of God.",
              "[112][113] Advocating for natural theology, he wrote: In the works of the Creator ever open to our examination, we possess a firm basis on which to raise the superstructure of an enlightened creed.",
              "The more man inquires into the laws which regulate the material universe, the more he is convinced that all its varied forms arise from the action of a few simple principles .",

              "The testimony of man becomes fainter at every stage of transmission, whilst each new inquiry into the works of the Almighty gives to us more exalted views of his wisdom, his goodness, and his power.",
              "[114] Like Samuel Vince, Babbage also wrote a defence of the belief in divine miracles.",
              "[115] Against objections previously posed by David Hume, Babbage advocated for the belief of divine agency, stating \"we must not measure the credibility or incredibility of an event by the narrow sphere of our own experience, nor forget that there is a Divine energy which overrides what we familiarly call the laws of nature.\"",
              "[116] He alluded to the limits of human experience, expressing: \"all that we see in a miracle is an effect which is new to our observation, and whose cause is concealed.",
              "The cause may be beyond the sphere of our observation, and would be thus beyond the familiar sphere of nature;",
              "but this does not make the event a violation of any law of nature.",
              "The limits of man's observation lie within very narrow boundaries, and it would be arrogance to suppose that the reach of man's power is to form the limits of the natural world.\"",
              "[117] The British Association was consciously modelled on the Deutsche Naturforscher-Versammlung, founded in 1822.",
              "[119] It rejected romantic science as well as metaphysics, and started to entrench the divisions of science from literature, and professionals from amateurs.",
              "[120] Belonging as he did to the \"Wattite\" faction in the BAAS, represented in particular by James Watt the younger, Babbage identified closely with industrialists.",
              "He wanted to go faster in the same directions, and had little time for the more gentlemanly component of its membership.",
              "Indeed, he subscribed to a version of conjectural history that placed industrial society as the culmination of human development (and shared this view with Herschel).",
              "A clash with Roderick Murchison led in 1838 to his withdrawal from further involvement.",
              "[121][122] At the end of the same year he sent in his resignation as Lucasian professor, walking away also from the Cambridge struggle with Whewell.",
              "His interests became more focussed, on computation and metrology, and on international contacts.",
              "[123] A project announced by Babbage was to tabulate all physical constants (referred to as \"constants of nature\", a phrase in itself a neologism), and then to compile an encyclopaedic work of numerical information.",
              "He was a pioneer in the field of \"absolute measurement\".",
              "[124] His ideas followed on from those of Johann Christian Poggendorff, and were mentioned to Brewster in 1832.",
              "There were to be 19 categories of constants, and Ian Hacking sees these as reflecting in part Babbage's \"eccentric enthusiasms\".",
              "[125] Babbage's paper On Tables of the Constants of Nature and Art was reprinted by the Smithsonian Institution in 1856, with an added note that the physical tables of Arnold Henry Guyot \"will form a part of the important work proposed in this article\".",

              "It was through Brunel that Babbage knew of Joseph Clement, and so came to encounter the artisans whom he observed in his work on manufactures.",
              "[128] Babbage provided an introduction for Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1830, for a contact with the proposed Bristol & Birmingham Railway.",
              "[129] He carried out studies, around 1838, to show the superiority of the broad gauge for railways, used by Brunel's Great Western Railway.",
              "[130][131] In 1838, Babbage invented the pilot (also called a cow-catcher), the metal frame attached to the front of locomotives that clears the tracks of obstacles;",
              "[132] he also constructed a dynamometer car.",
              "[130] His eldest son, Benjamin Herschel Babbage, worked as an engineer for Brunel on the railways before emigrating to Australia in the 1850s.",
              "[133] Babbage also invented an ophthalmoscope, which he gave to Thomas Wharton Jones for testing.",
              "Jones, however, ignored it.",
              "The device only came into use after being independently invented by Hermann von Helmholtz.",
              "[134][135] Babbage achieved notable results in cryptography, though this was still not known a century after his death.",
              "Letter frequency was category 18 of Babbage's tabulation project.",
              "Joseph Henry later defended interest in it, in the absence of the facts, as relevant to the management of movable type.",
              "[125] As early as 1845, Babbage had solved a cipher that had been posed as a challenge by his nephew Henry Hollier, and in the process, he made a discovery about ciphers that were based on Vigene\u0300re tables.",
              "Specifically, he realised that enciphering plain text with a keyword rendered the cipher text subject to modular arithmetic.",
              "[136] During the Crimean War of the 1850s, Babbage broke Vigene\u0300re's autokey cipher as well as the much weaker cipher that is called Vigene\u0300re cipher today.",
              "[137] His discovery was kept a military secret, and was not published.",
              "Credit for the result was instead given to Friedrich Kasiski, a Prussian infantry officer, who made the same discovery some years later.",
              "[138] However, in 1854, Babbage published the solution of a Vigene\u0300re cipher, which had been published previously in the Journal of the Society of Arts.",
              "[136][139] In 1855, Babbage also published a short letter, \"Cypher Writing\", in the same journal.",

              "[136][141] Babbage involved himself in well-publicised but unpopular campaigns against public nuisances.",
              "He once counted all the broken panes of glass of a factory, publishing in 1857 a \"Table of the Relative Frequency of the Causes of Breakage of Plate Glass Windows\": Of 464 broken panes, 14 were caused by \"drunken men, women or boys\".",
              "[142][143][144] Babbage's distaste for commoners (the Mob) included writing \"Observations of Street Nuisances\" in 1864, as well as tallying up 165 \"nuisances\" over a period of 80 days.",
              "He especially hated street music, and in particular the music of organ grinders, against whom he railed in various venues.",
              "The following quotation is typical: It is difficult to estimate the misery inflicted upon thousands of persons, and the absolute pecuniary penalty imposed upon multitudes of intellectual workers by the loss of their time, destroyed by organ-grinders and other similar nuisances.",
              "[145] Babbage was not alone in his campaign.",
              "A convert to the cause was the MP Michael Thomas Bass.",
              "[146] In the 1860s, Babbage also took up the anti-hoop-rolling campaign.",
              "He blamed hoop-rolling boys for driving their iron hoops under horses' legs, with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg.",
              "[147] Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter, being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for \"commencing a crusade against the popular game of tip-cat and the trundling of hoops.\"",
              "[148] Babbage's machines were among the first mechanical computers.",
              "That they were not actually completed was largely because of funding problems and clashes of personality, most notably with George Biddell Airy, the Astronomer Royal.",
              "[149] Babbage directed the building of some steam-powered machines that achieved some modest success, suggesting that calculations could be mechanised.",
              "For more than ten years he received government funding for his project, which amounted to \u00a317,000, but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in him.",
              "[150] While Babbage's machines were mechanical and unwieldy, their basic architecture was similar to that of a modern computer.",
              "The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction-based, the control unit could make conditional jumps, and the machine had a separate I/O unit.",

              "[53] At Cambridge, Babbage saw the fallibility of this process, and the opportunity of adding mechanisation into its management.",
              "His own account of his path towards mechanical computation references a particular occasion: In 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery.",
              "The French government had produced several tables by a new method.",
              "Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes.",
              "Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers [people] could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.",
              "[151] There was another period, seven years later, when his interest was aroused by the issues around computation of mathematical tables.",
              "The French official initiative by Gaspard de Prony, and its problems of implementation, were familiar to him.",
              "After the Napoleonic Wars came to a close, scientific contacts were renewed on the level of personal contact: in 1819 Charles Blagden was in Paris looking into the printing of the stalled de Prony project, and lobbying for the support of the Royal Society.",
              "In works of the 1820s and 1830s, Babbage referred in detail to de Prony's project.",
              "[152][153] Babbage began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine, made to compute values of polynomial functions.",
              "It was created to calculate a series of values automatically.",
              "By using the method of finite differences, it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division.",
              "[154] For a prototype difference engine, Babbage brought in Joseph Clement to implement the design, in 1823.",
              "Clement worked to high standards, but his machine tools were particularly elaborate.",
              "Under the standard terms of business of the time, he could charge for their construction, and would also own them.",

              "It is largely on it that Babbage's standing as computer pioneer rests.",
              "[161] The major innovation was that the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards: the Engine was intended to use loops of Jacquard's punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could use as input the results of preceding computations.",
              "[162][163] The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control, branching and looping.",
              "It would have been the first mechanical device to be, in principle, Turing-complete.",
              "The Engine was not a single physical machine, but rather a succession of designs that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871.",
              "[citation needed] Ada Lovelace, who corresponded with Babbage during his development of the Analytical Engine, is credited with developing an algorithm that would enable the Engine to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers.",

              "The Bernoulli numbers are particularly amenable to machine calculation because they are defined recursively: we may use the first to determine the second, the second for the third, and so on.",
              "There are several different ways of calculating these numbers, and Lovelace did not choose the simplest: she noted instead that the \u201cobject is not simplicity or facility of computation, but the illustration of the powers of the engine\u201d.",
              "The paper contained a detailed explanation of how the various quantities involved in the computation of the Bernoulli numbers are fetched from the Store, used in calculation in the Mill, and moved back again, according to the instructions on the cards.",
              "The process is illustrated using a large table, whose columns represent the values of the data, the variables, and the intermediate results, as the engine carried out each stage of the calculation.",
              "This table is often described as \u201cthe first computer program\u201d, though Lovelace wrote, more accurately, that it \u201cpresents a complete simultaneous view of all the successive changes\u201d in the components of the machine, as the calculation progresses.",
              "In other words, the table is what computer scientists would now call an \u201cexecution trace\u201d.",
              "The \u201cprogram\u201d, had the idea existed at the time, would have been the deck of punched cards that caused the machine to make those successive changes.",

              "Such tables were still used as a method for explaining computation 100 years later, when Geoff Toothill drew a similar diagram to illustrate the working of the first stored program computer, the \u201cManchester Baby\u201d.",

              "The paper shows Lovelace\u2019s obsessive attention to mathematical detail \u2013 it also shows her imagination in thinking about the bigger picture.",
              "She observed a fundamental principle of the machine, that the operations, defined by the cards, are separate from the data and the results.",
              "Famously, she observed that the machine might act upon things other than number, if those things satisfied mathematical rules.",

              "She observed a fundamental principle of the machine, that the operations, defined by the cards, are separate from the data and the results.",

              "In 1975, Paul Allen flew out to Albuquerque to demonstrate the BASIC interpreter that he and Bill Gates had written for the Altair microcomputer.",
              "Because neither of them had a working Altair, Allen and Gates tested their interpreter using an emulator that they wrote and ran on Harvard\u2019s computer system.",
              "The emulator was based on nothing more than the published specifications for the Intel 8080 processor.",
              "When Allen finally ran their interpreter on a real Altair\u2014in front of the person he and Gates hoped would buy their software\u2014he had no idea if it would work.",
              "But it did.",
              "The next month, Allen and Gates officially founded their new company.",
              "Over a century before Allen and Gates wrote their BASIC interpreter, Ada Lovelace wrote and published a computer program.",
              "She, too, wrote a program for a computer that had only been described to her.",
              "But her program, unlike the Microsoft BASIC interpreter, was never run, because the computer she was targeting was never built.",
              "Lovelace\u2019s program is often called the world\u2019s first computer program.",
              "Not everyone agrees that it should be called that.",
              "Lovelace\u2019s legacy, it turns out, is one of computing history\u2019s most hotly debated subjects.",
              "Walter Isaacson has written that the dispute about the extent and merit of her contributions constitutes a \u201cminor academic specialty.",
              "\u201d1 Inevitably, the fact that Lovelace was a woman has made this dispute a charged one.",
              "Historians have cited all kinds of primary evidence to argue that the credit given to Lovelace is either appropriate or undeserved.",
              "But they seem to spend less time explaining the technical details of her published writing, which is unfortunate, because the technical details are the most fascinating part of the story.",
              "Who wouldn\u2019t want to know exactly how a program written in 1843 was supposed to work?",
              "In fairness, Lovelace\u2019s program is not easy to explain to the layperson without some hand-waving.",
              "It\u2019s the intricacies of her program, though, that make it so remarkable.",
              "Whether or not she ought to be known as \u201cthe first programmer,\u201d her program was specified with a degree of rigor that far surpassed anything that came before.",
              "She thought carefully about how operations could be organized into groups that could be repeated, thereby inventing the loop.",
              "She realized how important it was to track the state of variables as they changed, introducing a notation to illustrate those changes.",
              "As a programmer myself, I\u2019m startled to see how much of what Lovelace was doing resembles the experience of writing software today.",
              "So let\u2019s take a closer look at Lovelace\u2019s program.",
              "She designed it to calculate the Bernoulli numbers.",
              "To understand what those are, we have to go back a couple millennia to the genesis of one of mathematics\u2019 oldest problems. The Pythagoreans lived on the shores of the Mediterranean and worshiped numbers.",
              "One of their pastimes was making triangles out of pebbles.",
              "One pebble followed by a row of two pebbles makes a triangle containing three pebbles.",
              "Add another row of three pebbles and you get a triangle containing six pebbles.",
              "You can continue like this, each time adding a row with one more pebble in it than the previous row.",
              "A triangle with six rows contains 21 pebbles.",
              "But how many pebbles does a triangle with 423 rows contain?",
              "What the Pythagoreans were looking for was a way to calculate the following without doing all the addition: They eventually realized that, if you place two triangles of the same size up against each other so that they form a rectangle, you can find the area of the rectangle and divide by two to get the number of pebbles in each of the triangles: Archimedes later explored a similar problem.",
              "He was interested in the following series: You might visualize this series by imagining a stack of progressively larger squares (made out of tiny cubes), one on top of the other, forming a pyramid.",
              "Archimedes wanted to know if there was an easy way to tell how many cubes would be needed to construct a pyramid with, say, 423 levels.",
              "He recorded a solution that also permits a geometrical interpretation.",
              "2 Three pyramids can be fit together to form a rectangular prism with a tiny, one-cube-high extrusion at one end.",
              "That little extrusion happens to be a triangle that obeys the same rules that the Pythagoreans used to make their pebble triangles.",
              "(This video might be a more helpful explanation of what I mean.)",
              "So the volume of the whole shape is given by the following equation: By substituting the Pythagorean equation for the sum of the first n integers and doing some algebra, you get this: In 499, the Indian mathematician and astronomer, Aryabhata, published a work known as the Aryabhatiya, which included a formula for calculating the sum of cubes: A formula for the sum of the first n positive integers raised to the fourth power wasn\u2019t published for another 500 years.",
              "3 You might be wondering at this point if there is a general method for finding the sum of the first n integers raised to the kth power.",
              "Mathematicians were wondering too.",
              "Johann Faulhaber, a German mathematician and slightly kooky numerologist, was able to calculate formulas for sums of integers up to the 17th power, which he published in 1631.",
              "But this may have taken him years and he did not state a general solution.",
              "4 Blaise Pascal finally outlined a general method in 1665, though it depended on first knowing how to calculate the sum of integers raised to every lesser power.",
              "5 To calculate the sum of the first n positive integers raised to the sixth power, for example, you would first have to know how to calculate the sum of the first n positive integers raised to the fifth power.",
              "A more practical general solution was stated in the posthumously published work of Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli, who died in 1705.",
              "Bernoulli began by deriving the formulas for calculating the sums of the first n positive integers to the first, second, and third powers.",
              "6 These he gave in polynomial form, so they looked like the below: Using Pascal\u2019s Triangle, Bernoulli realized that these polynomials followed a predictable pattern.",
              "Essentially, Bernoulli broke the coefficients of each term down into two factors, one of which he could determine using Pascal\u2019s Triangle and the other which he could derive from the interesting property that all the coefficients in the polynomial seemed to always add to one.",
              "Figuring out the exponent that should be attached to each term was no problem, because that also followed a predictable pattern.",
              "The factor of each coefficient that had to be calculated using the sums-to-one rule formed a sequence that became known as the Bernoulli numbers.",
              "Bernoulli\u2019s discovery did not mean that it was now trivial to calculate the sum of the first positive n integers to any given power.",
              "In order to calculate the sum of the first positive n integers raised to the kth power, you would need to know every Bernoulli number up to the kth Bernoulli number.",
              "Each Bernoulli number could only be calculated if the previous Bernoulli numbers were known.",
              "But calculating a long series of Bernoulli numbers was significantly easier than deriving each sum of powers formula in turn, so Bernoulli\u2019s discovery was a big advance for mathematics.",
              "Charles Babbage was born in 1791, nearly a century after Bernoulli died.",
              "I\u2019ve always had some vague idea that Babbage designed but did not build a mechanical computer.",
              "But I\u2019ve never entirely understood how that computer was supposed to work.",
              "The basic ideas, as it happens, are not that difficult to grasp, which is good news.",
              "Lovelace\u2019s program was designed to run on one of Babbage\u2019s machines, so we need to take another quick detour here to talk about how those machines worked.",
              "Babbage designed two separate mechanical computing machines.",
              "His first machine was called the Difference Engine.",
              "Before the invention of the pocket calculator, people relied on logarithmic tables to calculate the product of large numbers.",
              "(There is a good Numberphile video on how this was done.)",
              "Large logarithmic tables are not difficult to create, at least conceptually, but the sheer number of calculations that need to be done in order to create them meant that in Babbage\u2019s time they often contained errors.",
              "Babbage, frustrated by this, sought to create a machine that could tabulate logarithms mechanically and therefore without error.",
              "7 The Difference Engine was not a computer, because all it did was add and subtract.",
              "It took advantage of a method devised by the French mathematician Gaspard de Prony that broke the process of tabulating logarithms down into small steps.",
              "8 These small steps involved only addition and subtraction, meaning that a small army of people without any special mathematical aptitude or training could be employed to produce a table.",
              "De Prony\u2019s method, known as the method of divided differences, could be used to tabulate any polynomial.",
              "Polynomials, in turn, could be used to approximate logarithmic and trigonometric functions.",
              "To get a sense of how this process worked, consider the following simple polynomial function: The method of divided differences involves finding the difference between each successive value of y for different values of x.",
              "The differences between these differences are then found, and possibly the differences between those next differences themselves, until a constant difference appears.",
              "These differences can then be used to get the next value of the polynomial simply by adding.",
              "Because the above polynomial is only a second-degree polynomial, we are able to find the constant difference after only two columns of differences: Now, since we know that the constant difference is 2, we can find the value of y when x is 5 through addition only.",
              "If we add 2 to 7, the last entry in the \u201cDiff 1\u201d column, we get 9.",
              "If we add 9 to 17, the last entry in the y column, we get 26, our answer.",
              "Babbage\u2019s Difference Engine had, for each difference column in a table like the one above, a physical column of gears.",
              "Each gear was a decimal digit and one whole column was a decimal number.",
              "The Difference Engine had eight columns of gears, so it could tabulate a polynomial up to the seventh degree.",
              "The columns were initially set with values matching an early row in the difference table, worked out ahead of time.",
              "A human operator would then turn a crank shaft, causing the constant difference to propagate through the machine as the value stored on each column was added to the next.",
              "Babbage was able to build a small section of the Difference Engine and use it to demonstrate his ideas at parties.",
              "9 But even after spending an amount of public money equal to the cost of two large warships, he never built the entire machine.",
              "10 Babbage could not find anyone in the early 1800s that could make the number of gears he needed with sufficient accuracy.",
              "A working Difference Engine would not be built until the 1990s, after the advent of precision machining.",
              "There is a great video on YouTube demonstrating a working Difference Engine on loan to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, which is worth watching even just to listen to the marvelous sounds the machine makes while it runs.",
              "Babbage eventually lost interest in the Difference Engine when he realized that a much more powerful and flexible machine could be built.",
              "His Analytical Engine was the machine that we know today as Babbage\u2019s mechanical computer.",
              "The Analytical Engine was based on the same columns of gears used in the Difference Engine, but whereas the Difference Engine only had eight columns, the Analytical Engine was supposed to have many hundreds more.",
              "The Analytical Engine could be programmed using punched cards like a Jacquard Loom and could multiply and divide as well as add and subtract.",
              "In order to perform one of these operations, a section of the machine called the \u201cmill\u201d would rearrange itself into the appropriate configuration, read the operands off of other columns used for data storage, and then write the result back to another column.",
              "Babbage called his new machine the Analytical Engine because it was powerful enough to do something resembling mathematical analysis.",
              "The Difference Engine could tabulate a polynomial, but the Analytical Engine would be able to calculate, for example, the coefficients of the polynomial expansion of another expression.",
              "It was an amazing machine, but the British government wisely declined to fund its construction.",
              "So Babbage went abroad to Italy to try to drum up support for his idea.",
              "In Turin, Babbage met Italian engineer and future prime minister Luigi Menabrea.",
              "He persuaded Menabrea to write an outline of what the Analytical Engine could accomplish.",
              "In 1842, Menabrea published a paper on the topic in French.",
              "The following year, Lovelace published a translation of Menabrea\u2019s paper into English.",
              "Lovelace, then known as Ada Byron, first met Babbage at a party in 1833, when she was 17 and he was 41.",
              "11 Lovelace was fascinated with Babbage\u2019s Difference Engine.",
              "She could also understand how it worked, because she had been extensively tutored in mathematics throughout her childhood.",
              "Her mother, Annabella Milbanke, had decided that a solid grounding in mathematics would ward off the wild, romantic sensibility that possessed Lovelace\u2019s father, Lord Byron, the famous poet.",
              "After meeting in 1833, Lovelace and Babbage remained a part of the same social circle and wrote to each other frequently.",
              "Ada Byron married William King in 1835.",
              "King later became the Earl of Lovelace, making Ada the Countess of Lovelace.",
              "Even after having three children, she continued her education in mathematics, employing Augustus de Morgan, who discovered De Morgan\u2019s laws, as her tutor.",
              "12 Lovelace saw the potential of Babbage\u2019s Analytical Machine immediately and was eager to work with him to promote the idea.",
              "A friend suggested that she translate Menabrea\u2019s paper for an English audience.",
              "13 Menabrea\u2019s paper gave a brief overview of how the Difference Engine worked, then showed how the Analytical Engine would be a far superior machine.",
              "The Analytical Engine would be so powerful that it could \u201cform the product of two numbers, each containing twenty figures, in three minutes\u201d14 (emphasis in the original).",
              "Menabrea gave further examples of the machine\u2019s capabilities, demonstrating how it could solve a simple system of linear equations and expand the product of two binomial expressions.",
              "In both cases, Menabrea provided what Lovelace called \u201cdiagrams of development,\u201d which listed the sequence of operations that would need to be performed to calculate the correct answer.",
              "15 These were programs in the same sense that Lovelace\u2019s own program was a program and they were originally published the year before.",
              "But as we will see, Menabrea\u2019s programs were only simple examples of what was possible.",
              "All of them were trivial in the sense that they did not require any kind of branching or looping.",
              "Lovelace appended a series of notes to her translation of Menabrea\u2019s paper that together ran much longer than the original work.",
              "It was here that she made her major contributions to computing.",
              "In Note A, which Lovelace attached to Menabrea\u2019s initial description of the Analytical Engine, Lovelace explained at some length and often in lyrical language the promise of a machine that could perform arbitrary mathematical operations.",
              "She foresaw that a machine like the Analytical Engine wasn\u2019t just limited to numbers and could in fact act on any objects \u201cwhose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine.",
              "\u201d16 She added that the machine might one day, for example, compose music.",
              "This insight was all the more remarkable given that Menabrea saw the Analytical Engine primarily as a tool for automating \u201clong and arid computation,\u201d which would free up the intellectual capacities of brilliant scientists for more advanced thinking.",
              "17 The miraculous foresight that Lovelace demonstrated in Note A is one major reason that she is celebrated today.",
              "The other famous note is Note G.",
              "Lovelace begins Note G by arguing that, despite its impressive powers, the Analytical Machine cannot really be said to \u201cthink.",
              "\u201d This part of Note G is what Alan Turing would later refer to as \u201cLady Lovelace\u2019s Objection.",
              "\u201d Nevertheless, Lovelace continues, the machine can do extraordinary things.",
              "To illustrate its ability to handle even more complex problems, Lovelace provides her program calculating the Bernoulli numbers.",
              "The full program, in the expanded \u201cdiagram of development\u201d format that Lovelace explains in Note D, can be seen here.",
              "The program is essentially a list of operations, specified using the usual mathematical symbols.",
              "It doesn\u2019t appear that Babbage or Lovelace got as far as developing anything like a set of op codes for the Analytical Engine.",
              "Though Lovelace was describing a method for computing the entire sequence of Bernoulli numbers up to some limit, the program she provided only illustrated one step of that process.",
              "Her program calculated a number that she called B7, which modern mathematicians know as the eighth Bernoulli number.",
              "Her program thus sought to solve the following equation: In the above, each term represents a coefficient in the polynomial formula for the sum of integers to a particular power.",
              "Here that power is eight, since the eighth Bernoulli number first appears in the formula for the sum of positive integers to the eighth power.",
              "The B and A numbers represent the two kinds of factors that Bernoulli discovered.",
              "B1 through B7 are all different Bernoulli numbers, indexed according to Lovelace\u2019s indexing.",
              "A0 through A5 represent the factors of the coefficients that Bernoulli could calculate using Pascal\u2019s Triangle.",
              "The values of A0, A1, A3, and A5 appear below.",
              "Here n represents the index of the Bernoulli number in the sequence of odd-numbered Bernoulli numbers starting with the first.",
              "Lovelace\u2019s program used n = 4.",
              "I\u2019ve created a translation of Lovelace\u2019s program into C, which may be easier to follow.",
              "Lovelace\u2019s program first calculates A0 and the product B1A1.",
              "It then enters a loop that repeats twice to calculate B3A3 and B5A5, since those are formed according to an identical pattern.",
              "After each product is calculated, it is added with all the previous products, so that by the end of the program the full sum has been obtained.",
              "Obviously the C translation is not an exact recreation of Lovelace\u2019s program.",
              "It declares variables on the stack, for example, whereas Lovelace\u2019s variables were more like registers.",
              "But it makes obvious the parts of Lovelace\u2019s program that were so prescient.",
              "The C program contains two while loops, one nested inside the other.",
              "Lovelace\u2019s program did not have while loops exactly, but she made groups of operations and in the text of her note specified when they should repeat.",
              "The variable v10, in the original program and in the C translation, functions as a counter variable that decrements with each loop, a construct any programmer would be familiar with.",
              "In fact, aside from the profusion of variables with unhelpful names, the C translation of Lovelace\u2019s program doesn\u2019t look that alien at all.",
              "The other thing worth mentioning quickly is that translating Lovelace\u2019s program into C was not that difficult, thanks to the detail present in her diagram.",
              "Unlike Menabrea\u2019s tables, her table includes a column labeled \u201cIndication of change in the value on any Variable,\u201d which makes it much easier to follow the mutation of state throughout the program.",
              "She adds a superscript index here to each variable to indicate the successive values they hold.",
              "A superscript of two, for example, means that the value being used here is the second value that has been assigned to the variable since the beginning of the program.",
              "After I had translated Lovelace\u2019s program into C, I was able to run it on my own computer.",
              "To my frustration, I kept getting the wrong result.",
              "After some debugging, I finally realized that the problem wasn\u2019t the code that I had written.",
              "The bug was in the original!",
              "In her \u201cdiagram of development,\u201d Lovelace gives the fourth operation as v5 / v4.",
              "But the correct ordering here is v4 / v5.",
              "This may well have been a typesetting error and not an error in the program that Lovelace devised.",
              "All the same, this must be the oldest bug in computing.",
              "I marveled that, for ten minutes or so, unknowingly, I had wrestled with this first ever bug.",
              "Jim Randall, another blogger that has translated Lovelace\u2019s program into Python, has noted this division bug and two other issues.",
              "What does it say about Ada Lovelace that her published program contains minor bugs?",
              "Perhaps it shows that she was attempting to write not just a demonstration but a real program.",
              "After all, can you really be writing anything more than toy programs if you aren\u2019t also writing lots of bugs?",
              "One Wikipedia article calls Lovelace the first to publish a \u201ccomplex program.",
              "\u201d18 Maybe that\u2019s the right way to think about Lovelace\u2019 accomplishment.",
              "Menabrea published \u201cdiagrams of development\u201d in his paper a year before Lovelace published her translation.",

              "Because neither of them had a working Altair, Allen and Gates tested their interpreter using an emulator that they wrote and ran on Harvard\u2019s computer system.",
              "The emulator was based on nothing more than the published specifications for the Intel 8080 processor.",

              "But they seem to spend less time explaining the technical details of her published writing, which is unfortunate, because the technical details are the most fascinating part of the story.",
              "Who wouldn\u2019t want to know exactly how a program written in 1843 was supposed to work?",
              "In fairness, Lovelace\u2019s program is not easy to explain to the layperson without some hand-waving.",

              "She thought carefully about how operations could be organized into groups that could be repeated, thereby inventing the loop.",
              "She realized how important it was to track the state of variables as they changed, introducing a notation to illustrate those changes.",
              "As a programmer myself, I\u2019m startled to see how much of what Lovelace was doing resembles the experience of writing software today.",
              "So let\u2019s take a closer look at Lovelace\u2019s program.",
              "She designed it to calculate the Bernoulli numbers.",
              "To understand what those are, we have to go back a couple millennia to the genesis of one of mathematics\u2019 oldest problems. The Pythagoreans lived on the shores of the Mediterranean and worshiped numbers.",
              "One of their pastimes was making triangles out of pebbles.",
              "One pebble followed by a row of two pebbles makes a triangle containing three pebbles.",
              "Add another row of three pebbles and you get a triangle containing six pebbles.",
              "You can continue like this, each time adding a row with one more pebble in it than the previous row.",
              "A triangle with six rows contains 21 pebbles.",
              "But how many pebbles does a triangle with 423 rows contain?",
              "What the Pythagoreans were looking for was a way to calculate the following without doing all the addition: They eventually realized that, if you place two triangles of the same size up against each other so that they form a rectangle, you can find the area of the rectangle and divide by two to get the number of pebbles in each of the triangles: Archimedes later explored a similar problem.",
              "He was interested in the following series: You might visualize this series by imagining a stack of progressively larger squares (made out of tiny cubes), one on top of the other, forming a pyramid.",
              "Archimedes wanted to know if there was an easy way to tell how many cubes would be needed to construct a pyramid with, say, 423 levels.",
              "He recorded a solution that also permits a geometrical interpretation.",
              "2 Three pyramids can be fit together to form a rectangular prism with a tiny, one-cube-high extrusion at one end.",
              "That little extrusion happens to be a triangle that obeys the same rules that the Pythagoreans used to make their pebble triangles.",
              "(This video might be a more helpful explanation of what I mean.)",
              "So the volume of the whole shape is given by the following equation: By substituting the Pythagorean equation for the sum of the first n integers and doing some algebra, you get this: In 499, the Indian mathematician and astronomer, Aryabhata, published a work known as the Aryabhatiya, which included a formula for calculating the sum of cubes: A formula for the sum of the first n positive integers raised to the fourth power wasn\u2019t published for another 500 years.",
              "3 You might be wondering at this point if there is a general method for finding the sum of the first n integers raised to the kth power.",
              "Mathematicians were wondering too.",
              "Johann Faulhaber, a German mathematician and slightly kooky numerologist, was able to calculate formulas for sums of integers up to the 17th power, which he published in 1631.",
              "But this may have taken him years and he did not state a general solution.",
              "4 Blaise Pascal finally outlined a general method in 1665, though it depended on first knowing how to calculate the sum of integers raised to every lesser power.",
              "5 To calculate the sum of the first n positive integers raised to the sixth power, for example, you would first have to know how to calculate the sum of the first n positive integers raised to the fifth power.",
              "A more practical general solution was stated in the posthumously published work of Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli, who died in 1705.",
              "Bernoulli began by deriving the formulas for calculating the sums of the first n positive integers to the first, second, and third powers.",
              "6 These he gave in polynomial form, so they looked like the below: Using Pascal\u2019s Triangle, Bernoulli realized that these polynomials followed a predictable pattern.",
              "Essentially, Bernoulli broke the coefficients of each term down into two factors, one of which he could determine using Pascal\u2019s Triangle and the other which he could derive from the interesting property that all the coefficients in the polynomial seemed to always add to one.",
              "Figuring out the exponent that should be attached to each term was no problem, because that also followed a predictable pattern.",
              "The factor of each coefficient that had to be calculated using the sums-to-one rule formed a sequence that became known as the Bernoulli numbers.",
              "Bernoulli\u2019s discovery did not mean that it was now trivial to calculate the sum of the first positive n integers to any given power.",
              "In order to calculate the sum of the first positive n integers raised to the kth power, you would need to know every Bernoulli number up to the kth Bernoulli number.",
              "Each Bernoulli number could only be calculated if the previous Bernoulli numbers were known.",
              "But calculating a long series of Bernoulli numbers was significantly easier than deriving each sum of powers formula in turn, so Bernoulli\u2019s discovery was a big advance for mathematics.",
              "Charles Babbage was born in 1791, nearly a century after Bernoulli died.",
              "I\u2019ve always had some vague idea that Babbage designed but did not build a mechanical computer.",
              "But I\u2019ve never entirely understood how that computer was supposed to work.",
              "The basic ideas, as it happens, are not that difficult to grasp, which is good news.",
              "Lovelace\u2019s program was designed to run on one of Babbage\u2019s machines, so we need to take another quick detour here to talk about how those machines worked.",
              "Babbage designed two separate mechanical computing machines.",
              "His first machine was called the Difference Engine.",
              "Before the invention of the pocket calculator, people relied on logarithmic tables to calculate the product of large numbers.",
              "(There is a good Numberphile video on how this was done.)",
              "Large logarithmic tables are not difficult to create, at least conceptually, but the sheer number of calculations that need to be done in order to create them meant that in Babbage\u2019s time they often contained errors.",
              "Babbage, frustrated by this, sought to create a machine that could tabulate logarithms mechanically and therefore without error.",
              "7 The Difference Engine was not a computer, because all it did was add and subtract.",
              "It took advantage of a method devised by the French mathematician Gaspard de Prony that broke the process of tabulating logarithms down into small steps.",
              "8 These small steps involved only addition and subtraction, meaning that a small army of people without any special mathematical aptitude or training could be employed to produce a table.",
              "De Prony\u2019s method, known as the method of divided differences, could be used to tabulate any polynomial.",
              "Polynomials, in turn, could be used to approximate logarithmic and trigonometric functions.",
              "To get a sense of how this process worked, consider the following simple polynomial function: The method of divided differences involves finding the difference between each successive value of y for different values of x.",
              "The differences between these differences are then found, and possibly the differences between those next differences themselves, until a constant difference appears.",
              "These differences can then be used to get the next value of the polynomial simply by adding.",
              "Because the above polynomial is only a second-degree polynomial, we are able to find the constant difference after only two columns of differences: Now, since we know that the constant difference is 2, we can find the value of y when x is 5 through addition only.",
              "If we add 2 to 7, the last entry in the \u201cDiff 1\u201d column, we get 9.",
              "If we add 9 to 17, the last entry in the y column, we get 26, our answer.",
              "Babbage\u2019s Difference Engine had, for each difference column in a table like the one above, a physical column of gears.",
              "Each gear was a decimal digit and one whole column was a decimal number.",
              "The Difference Engine had eight columns of gears, so it could tabulate a polynomial up to the seventh degree.",
              "The columns were initially set with values matching an early row in the difference table, worked out ahead of time.",
              "A human operator would then turn a crank shaft, causing the constant difference to propagate through the machine as the value stored on each column was added to the next.",
              "Babbage was able to build a small section of the Difference Engine and use it to demonstrate his ideas at parties.",
              "9 But even after spending an amount of public money equal to the cost of two large warships, he never built the entire machine.",
              "10 Babbage could not find anyone in the early 1800s that could make the number of gears he needed with sufficient accuracy.",
              "A working Difference Engine would not be built until the 1990s, after the advent of precision machining.",
              "There is a great video on YouTube demonstrating a working Difference Engine on loan to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, which is worth watching even just to listen to the marvelous sounds the machine makes while it runs.",
              "Babbage eventually lost interest in the Difference Engine when he realized that a much more powerful and flexible machine could be built.",
              "His Analytical Engine was the machine that we know today as Babbage\u2019s mechanical computer.",
              "The Analytical Engine was based on the same columns of gears used in the Difference Engine, but whereas the Difference Engine only had eight columns, the Analytical Engine was supposed to have many hundreds more.",
              "The Analytical Engine could be programmed using punched cards like a Jacquard Loom and could multiply and divide as well as add and subtract.",
              "In order to perform one of these operations, a section of the machine called the \u201cmill\u201d would rearrange itself into the appropriate configuration, read the operands off of other columns used for data storage, and then write the result back to another column.",
              "Babbage called his new machine the Analytical Engine because it was powerful enough to do something resembling mathematical analysis.",
              "The Difference Engine could tabulate a polynomial, but the Analytical Engine would be able to calculate, for example, the coefficients of the polynomial expansion of another expression.",
              "It was an amazing machine, but the British government wisely declined to fund its construction.",
              "So Babbage went abroad to Italy to try to drum up support for his idea.",
              "In Turin, Babbage met Italian engineer and future prime minister Luigi Menabrea.",
              "He persuaded Menabrea to write an outline of what the Analytical Engine could accomplish.",
              "In 1842, Menabrea published a paper on the topic in French.",
              "The following year, Lovelace published a translation of Menabrea\u2019s paper into English.",
              "Lovelace, then known as Ada Byron, first met Babbage at a party in 1833, when she was 17 and he was 41.",
              "11 Lovelace was fascinated with Babbage\u2019s Difference Engine.",
              "She could also understand how it worked, because she had been extensively tutored in mathematics throughout her childhood.",
              "Her mother, Annabella Milbanke, had decided that a solid grounding in mathematics would ward off the wild, romantic sensibility that possessed Lovelace\u2019s father, Lord Byron, the famous poet.",
              "After meeting in 1833, Lovelace and Babbage remained a part of the same social circle and wrote to each other frequently.",
              "Ada Byron married William King in 1835.",
              "King later became the Earl of Lovelace, making Ada the Countess of Lovelace.",
              "Even after having three children, she continued her education in mathematics, employing Augustus de Morgan, who discovered De Morgan\u2019s laws, as her tutor.",
              "12 Lovelace saw the potential of Babbage\u2019s Analytical Machine immediately and was eager to work with him to promote the idea.",
              "A friend suggested that she translate Menabrea\u2019s paper for an English audience.",
              "13 Menabrea\u2019s paper gave a brief overview of how the Difference Engine worked, then showed how the Analytical Engine would be a far superior machine.",
              "The Analytical Engine would be so powerful that it could \u201cform the product of two numbers, each containing twenty figures, in three minutes\u201d14 (emphasis in the original).",
              "Menabrea gave further examples of the machine\u2019s capabilities, demonstrating how it could solve a simple system of linear equations and expand the product of two binomial expressions.",
              "In both cases, Menabrea provided what Lovelace called \u201cdiagrams of development,\u201d which listed the sequence of operations that would need to be performed to calculate the correct answer.",
              "15 These were programs in the same sense that Lovelace\u2019s own program was a program and they were originally published the year before.",
              "But as we will see, Menabrea\u2019s programs were only simple examples of what was possible.",
              "All of them were trivial in the sense that they did not require any kind of branching or looping.",
              "Lovelace appended a series of notes to her translation of Menabrea\u2019s paper that together ran much longer than the original work.",
              "It was here that she made her major contributions to computing.",
              "In Note A, which Lovelace attached to Menabrea\u2019s initial description of the Analytical Engine, Lovelace explained at some length and often in lyrical language the promise of a machine that could perform arbitrary mathematical operations.",

              "Whilst studying differential calculus, she wrote to De Morgan: I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies.",

              "[54] During a nine-month period in 1842\u201343, Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine.",

              "the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing.",

              "[62] Based on this work, Lovelace is now considered by many to be the first computer programmer[63][failed verification] and her method has been called the world's first computer program.",

              "In the course of her research, which began in February, 1828, according to her biographer Betty Alexandra Toole, Ada wrote and illustrated a guide called \u201cFlyology,\u201d to record her findings.",
              "She toiled away on this project until her mother reprimanded her for neglecting her studies, which were meant to set her on a rational course, not a fanciful one.",

              "A few days later, Lady Byron took Ada to his home at 1 Dorset Street to see him demonstrate the device in his drawing room.",
              "Ada, intrigued by the incomplete prototype, struck up a correspondence with Babbage about its potential, and her own mathematical studies.",

              "\u201d Her translation, along with her notes, was published in 1843, and represent her greatest contribution to computer science: she described with clarity how Babbage\u2019s device would work, illuminating its foundations in the Jacquard loom.",
              "Just as Joseph-Marie Jacquard\u2019s silk-weaving machine could automatically create images using a chain of punched cards, so too could Babbage\u2019s system\u2014the engine, Lovelace explained, weaved algebraic patterns.",
              "She also wrote how it might perform a particular calculation: Note G, as it is known, set out a detailed plan for the punched cards to weave a long sequence of Bernoulli numbers, and is considered to be the first computer program.",
              "\u201cThe science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially, is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value,\u201d Lovelace wrote.",
              "Essinger interprets this line in his biography, writing, \u201cAda is here seeking to do nothing less than invent the science of computing, and separate it from the science of mathematics.",
              "What she calls \u2018the science of operations\u2019 is indeed in effect computing.",
              "\u201d Beyond that, Lovelace articulated, as not even Babbage could, the poetic significance of his machine.",
              "She wrote: This science constitutes the language through which alone we can adequately express the great facts of the natural world, and those unceasing changes of mutual relationship which, visibly or invisibly, consciously or unconsciously to our immediate physical perceptions, are interminably going on in the agencies of the creation we live amidst.",
              "She continues: A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have rendered possible.",
              "Thus not only the mental and the material, but the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are brought into more intimate and effective connection with each other.",
              "Years later, scholars would dispute that Lovelace actually wrote the notes.",
              "The Babbage historian Bruce Collier argued that her contribution had been greatly overstated, and \u201cit is no exaggeration to say that she was a manic depressive with the most amazing delusions about her own talents, and a rather shallow understanding of Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine.",
              "\u201d But Essinger, Toole, and others reject this interpretation.",
              "\u201cAs people realized how important computer programming was, there was a greater backlash and an attempt to reclaim it as a male activity,\u201d Aurora told me.",
              "\u201cIn order to keep that wealth and power in a man\u2019s hands, there\u2019s a backlash to try to redefine it as something a woman didn\u2019t do, and shouldn\u2019t do, and couldn\u2019t do.",

              "Despite Ada\u2019s yearning for a life of the mind, she was essentially directed by her mother to follow a conventional upper middle class upbringing.",
              "By this point Lady Byron was one of the wealthiest women in Britain, and had the influence and power to ensure Ada did exactly as she pleased.",
              "In 1835, with her mother\u2019s approval, Ada married a pleasant but not especially intellectually gifted young aristocrat, Lord William King, who in due course inherited the title of Earl of Lovelace.",
              "William was devoted to Ada and admired her greatly.",
              "He once reportedly remarked to her, \u201cwhat a general you would make\u201d.",
              "Yet by the time Ada had married the man approved of by her mother, she had also met another man who made a huge impression on her, on both a personal and intellectual level.",
              "This was Charles Babbage \u2013 a man 24 years Ada\u2019s elder \u2013 who she met on the evening of 5 June 1833, at a party in London.",
              "Ada was clearly fascinated by Babbage and his plans to build a cogwheel calculating machine, which he called the Difference Engine.",
              "Babbage, in turn, was surely flattered by the attention from a famous young lady;",
              "Ada\u2019s fame stemmed from her father, and she was something of a celebrity in her day.",
              "Babbage invited Lady Byron and Ada to visit his home on Dorset Street, near Manchester Square in London, to see a completed model he had made of his Difference Engine.",
              "This was a working model one-seventh of the full-size machine, the whole of which Babbage never managed to complete.",
              "Ada was deeply impressed by the model.",
              "She and Babbage became firm friends, though due to the disparity in their ages and the fact that Ada was only 17 when they met, in the early days of their friendship, they usually met only when Lady Byron was present.",
              "In 1834, Babbage began working on an even more ambitious machine than the Difference Engine, which he called the Analytical Engine.",
              "This was essentially a general-purpose programmable digital computer that used cogwheels operating in base 10 (our everyday mathematical numbering system that uses decimal numbers), rather than electronic components operating in binary.",
              "Otherwise, it featured most of the logical components of a modern electronic computer.",
              "These included memory, storage and programming, for which Babbage borrowed the idea of using punched cards from the programmable Jacquard Loom (a programmable loom first demonstrated in 1801, which could weave any pattern).",
              "The Analytical Engine even featured security measures to warn the machine\u2019s operator when they made a mistake.",
              "Lovelace was even more fascinated by the Analytical Engine than by the Difference Engine.",
              "Neither machine was ever completed.",
              "Yet while Babbage\u2019s plans for the Analytical Engine never got beyond the design stage, they do include 2,200 notations and about 300 design drawings.",
              "(There is an ongoing modern initiative to build an Analytical Engine, although no machine is likely to be built for about a decade as the project is only being funded slowly and requires extensive work.)",
              "For a long time, many modern commentators \u2013 typically male computer scientists \u2013 were scathing about Lovelace\u2019s contribution to Babbage\u2019s work, regarding her at worse a nuisance, or at best merely someone who proved helpful in publicising his efforts.",
              "Babbage himself called Lovelace his \u2018interpretess\u2019 \u2013 clearly that was the extent to which he regarded her contribution.",
              "However, more recent modern research has made it clear that Lovelace\u2019s contribution to the thinking at the heart of the prehistory of the computer was enormous.",
              "In 1843 she translated a paper on the Analytical Engine from French, written by an Italian scientist and future prime minister of Italy, Luigi Federico Menabrea.",
              "Lovelace went far beyond merely translating this paper \u2013 she wrote around 20,000 words of her own Notes (the word is usually capitalised in Lovelace\u2019s studies) that discussed the Analytical Engine\u2019s potential.",
              "Her translation and Notes were subsequently published under her initials, AAL.",
              "While it is clear that Babbage helped Lovelace with some of the technical material in her Notes, theories that Babbage wrote most of the Notes himself have now been discredited.",
              "This is partly because linguistic analysis shows that the voice the Notes were written in was very much Ada\u2019s, but also because Ada clearly had insights into the Analytical Engine that Babbage seemingly lacked.",
              "Babbage saw the Analytical Engine as a brilliant machine for doing mathematics, which it certainly was.",
              "However, there is no clear evidence that he ever saw it as anything more.",
              "Lovelace\u2019s Notes, on the other hand, reveal that she regarded the machine as something that could not only enact calculations, but could also carry out all kinds of processes that could govern all kinds of applications.",
              "She famously remarked that the \u201cAnalytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard Loom weaves flowers and leaves\u201d.",
              "This brilliant insight into what the Jacquard Loom could do is an important part of Lovelace\u2019s contribution towards the early history of the computer.",
              "She called her own particular brand of thinking about science \u201cpoetical science\u201d, and also recognised that the Analytical Engine could even compose music if properly set up to do so.",
              "As she wrote: \u201cSupposing that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition could be expressed and adapted within the Analytical Engine, it might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.",
              "\u201d On 27 November 1852, Ada died from cancer, most likely of the uterus.",
              "She was only 36 at the time, the same age at which her father had died.",
              "She now lies next to him in the sealed Byron family tomb in St Mary Magdalene Church, Hucknall, in Nottinghamshire.",
              "Lovelace\u2019s reputation today as a pioneer in the thinking of the early history of the computer is unquestionably deserved.",
              "Some have gone so far as to claim that Lovelace was the world\u2019s first computer programmer, though as Charles Babbage biographer and computer science historian Doron Swade MBE points out, Babbage\u2019s programs predate Lovelace\u2019s by seven years.",
              "Lovelace became fascinated by the algorithms that the Analytical Engine might calculate, and one of the great tragedies in the history of computing is that she was not involved in Babbage\u2019s work more.",
              "In August 1843, Ada wrote a long letter to Babbage suggesting that he let her help manage all the aspects of the Analytical Engine build project that required the influencing of important people.",
              "But he rejected her offer.",
              "It is not clear why;",
              "the best guess is that while he greatly approved of her work in publicising his engines, and the Analytical Engine in particular, he felt uncomfortable about letting Ada be involved in the project itself.",
              "What is fascinating is that even after Babbage\u2019s curt rejection of Ada\u2019s offer of help, she and Babbage remained lifelong friends.",
              "While Babbage never completed a Difference Engine or an Analytical Engine himself, in 1991 a team at the London Science Museum - working under Doron Swade\u2019s leadership - completed the fully working full-size calculation element of the Difference Engine.",
              "In 2002, they successfully completed a full-scale working Difference Engine.",
              "The project took 17 years to complete and is a most impressive sight: a magnificent piece of pioneering 19th-century engineering realised in the 20th century.",
              "Today, Ada is quite rightly seen as an icon of feminist scientific achievement, a heroine of the mind, and one of the earliest visionaries in the early history of the computer.",
