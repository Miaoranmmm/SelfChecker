    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. There is no definitive answer to what is the most impactful and successful business model for sustainable and ethical fashion brands, as different brands may have different approaches and goals. However, some common elements that many sustainable and ethical fashion brands share are:\n\n- Using eco-friendly materials, such as organic cotton, hemp, bamboo, recycled polyester, etc. that have lower environmental impacts than conventional fabrics[^1^] [^4^].\n- Adopting circular business models, such as resale, rental, repair and refurbishment, that extend the life cycle of clothing and reduce waste and emissions[^2^] [^7^].\n- Ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions and well-being for the workers who make the clothes, often through third-party certifications or direct partnerships with suppliers[^4^] [^8^].\n- Educating consumers about the environmental and social impacts of their clothing choices, and providing transparent information about their production processes and supply chains[^2^] [^9^].\n- Innovating new ways of designing, producing and delivering clothes that minimize harm to the planet and people, such as using renewable energy, biodegradable packaging, digital technologies, etc.[^2^] [^10^].\n\nAs for how consumers can support these businesses, some possible ways are:\n\n- Buying less but better quality clothes that last longer and can be reused or recycled[^2^] [^4^].\n- Choosing brands that have clear sustainability and ethical policies and practices, and avoiding those that greenwash or exploit workers[^2^] [^8^].\n- Supporting local and independent brands that have more control over their production and distribution[^4^] [^9^].\n- Participating in circular fashion initiatives, such as swapping, donating, renting or reselling clothes that are no longer needed or wanted[^2^] [^7^].\n- Demanding more accountability and transparency from the fashion industry, and advocating for more regulations and incentives to promote sustainability and ethics[^2^] [^8^].\n\nI hope this helps you understand some of the aspects of sustainable and ethical fashion.

              "of what fabrics are sustainable.",
              "At the top of our sustainable fabrics list is organic cotton, one of the most natural fabrics out there.",
              "Unlike conventional cotton production (AKA the \u201cworld\u2019s dirtiest crop\u201d), organic cotton is grown without pesticides and synthetic fertilizers and processed with no chemicals\u2014overall using 62% less energy and 88% less water.",
              "There are several certifications used with sustainable and ethical cotton to tell us that the cotton was A) grown without any chemicals or machine harvesting;",
              "and B) processed without any chemicals leaving the final garment chemical-free.",
              "Organic cotton that\u2019s approved by the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS-certified for short) is most common.",
              "Other pertinent certifications like fair trade ensure fair pay and safe conditions for farmers (though not being exposed to chemicals in the field is already a huge component in that regard).",
              "You\u2019ll find this sustainable fabric in textiles of all kinds, from clothing like organic cotton pajamas to homewares like organic comforters.",
              "What are the best sustainable fabrics?",
              "Those made from natural AND recycled materials are a good bet.",
              "Recycled cotton is produced using either post-industrial or post-consumer waste.",
              "This means that your favorite sustainable underwear or sustainable blue jeans could be made from industry fabric scrap or other recycled cotton garments.",
              "This not only means no demand for cotton farming, but also means textile waste is diverted from landfills.",
              "However, certifications and regulation is difficult because it\u2019s hard to know where the recycled cotton comes from.",
              "It also becomes difficult to know whether recycled cotton is pure cotton (and could thus be composted) because a garment can be recycled into recycled cotton even if it bears 4% or less synthetic fibers.",
              "Looking for the bluesign\u00ae Approved or OEKO-TEX certification logos can reassure you of non-toxicity in cases of fibers of mysterious origin, especially given how chemically-intensive conventional cotton is.",
              "Hemp fabric is one of the most eco-friendly natural fabrics around.",
              "It\u2019s high-yielding, not water or chemical intensive, and provides phytoremediation benefits to soil (AKA restores soil nutrients and cleans impurities like heavy metals and other toxins).",
              "The main reason our hearts are racing for hemp clothing?",
              "It\u2019s considered a carbon negative raw material.",
              "It actually absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere, more so than your average plant.",
              "Because it has so many wearable benefits (like being naturally sun protective and antimicrobial) and is harder to grow, hemp tends to be slightly more expensive than other sustainable organic fabrics, though we can expect to see more of it in the future.",
              "For years, there was no mechanism by which you could certify organic hemp, but that\u2019s changed in recent years and now a number of certifying agencies under the arm of the US Department of Agriculture oversee this organic hemp farming process.",
              "Linen is almost identical to hemp in terms of sustainability, as well as in their super light and breathable final fabrics.",
              "The only difference?",
              "Organic linen is derived from the flax plant, whose growth requires little to no fertilizer, pesticide, and irrigation inputs.",
              "However, unlike hemp, organic linen isn\u2019t as high-yielding and grows in more specific climates (Europe, mainly), which makes it a bit more of a luxury commodity.",
              "But that doesn\u2019t stop this centuries-old eco-friendly fabric becoming a favorite for everything from linen clothing to linen sheets.",
              "When bamboo is harvested, it can be done without killing the plant itself.",
              "That means bamboo can renew super quickly, making it one of the fastest growing plants on the planet.",
              "Like hemp, bamboo consumes more CO2 than most trees and doesn\u2019t require a lot of inputs.",
              "It can also survive on rainfall alone.",
              "When sourced from certified sustainably managed forests, bamboo can be turned into a sustainable material\u2014so long as it\u2019s mechanically-processed, not chemically-processed.",
              "Look for organic bamboo fabric in raw form, as opposed to that which is plasticized into bamboo rayon/viscose using harmful chemicals.",
              "More on this later, as it\u2019s important to know the distinction, given the sustainable form of bamboo makes up only a tiny amount of what we find on the market.",
              "Cork fabric has left the board and the bottle to make it onto our bodies.",
              "Cork is sustainably harvested from a cork oak (yes, it\u2019s from a tree) by simply shaving away the bark.",
              "In fact, Quercus suber can (and should) be harvested to extend its life.",
              "While the tree is regrowing the bark, it consumes more carbon dioxide than most types of trees, meaning cork plantations act as a carbon sink.",
              "Not only that, but cork is a valuable member of a unique ecosystem, supporting a range of plant and animal species.",
              "Once harvested from a mature tree every 9 to 12 years, the cork can be laid out in the sun to dry, and then just requires water to transform it into something suitable for fashion.",
              "As one of the most sustainable vegan leather alternatives, it\u2019s become a popular choice for vegan handbags and vegan shoes.",
              "Synthetic fabrics largely represent the opposite of what we look for in eco-friendly clothing fabrics.",
              "They\u2019re made of petroleum, release thousands of microplastics in waterways with each wash, and will sit in landfills for hundreds of years.",
              "But since synthetics have a function in fashion (such as sustainable swimwear fabrics, where something stretchy and quick-drying is needed), we turn to their recycled alternatives.",
              "While we wouldn\u2019t call regular nylon eco-friendly, its recycled nylon counterpart\u2014usually called ECONYL\u00ae\u2014is another story.",
              "It uses synthetic waste from ocean plastic, abandoned fishing nets, and waste fabric and reforms them into recycled nylon fabric that feels exactly the same.",
              "It\u2019s also made using a closed-loop system and doesn\u2019t require as much water.",
              "While we\u2019re excited about recycled fabrics and all the possibilities for eco-friendly swimwear it\u2019s opened up, it still releases microplastics\u2014meaning it\u2019s up to us as consumers to mitigate that by religiously washing these items in a Guppyfriend washing bag.",
              "Single-use plastics are wreaking havoc on our environment, and many brands have worked out ways to give landfill-bound plastic bags, bottles, and textiles a second life.",
              "Recycled polyester is made from the #1 type of plastic (hence the name rPET), often recycled plastic bottles.",
              "Like virgin polyester (and most synthetic fabrics), rPET is versatile and can take the form of many different feels and functions\u2014from thin and light stretchy sustainable activewear to thick and fluffy fleece.",
              "It\u2019s been the go-to sustainable activewear fabric for brands like Patagonia and Reformation for years.",
              "However, aside from also releasing microplastics, PET can only be recycled so much before it degrades in quality to the point of needing to be discarded.",
              "There are also concerns about some of the toxic substances in PET bottles and the effects upon the wearer (like BPA in sports bras), so non-toxic certifications are important here.",
              "Deadstock fabric rounds out the trifecta of common recycled types of sustainable fabrics.",
              "While both recycled polyester and nylon can be made of other garments, deadstock exclusively is.",
              "It refers to garments created using other garments, whether they be off-cuts and manufacturing scraps, vintage clothing, or unsold clothing (AKA \u201cdeadstock\u201d).",
              "Because it requires no processing (the dyes and patterns simply are what they are), it has a lower manufacturing footprint and keeps valuable materials from landfills.",
              "No wonder it\u2019s a popular choice among zero waste clothing brands and upcycled clothing brands.",
              "As with recycled cotton, additional certifications regarding non-toxicity testing can assure you no toxic residues from the original fabrics remain.",
              "Of all the new sustainable fabrics, lyocell fabric has gained the most traction\u2014and for good reason.",
              "Technically a type of rayon fabric (which is not historically among the most eco-friendly fabrics), lyocell s a semi-synthetic or cellulosic fabric made from the wood pulp of (usually) eucalyptus trees, which don\u2019t require a lot of water and pesticides.",
              "But not all lyocell is created equal.",
              "Trademarked by its Austrian manufacturer Lenzing, TENCELTM lyocell is the most sustainable option.",
              "TENCELTM lyocell means sourcing from sustainably-managed forests and a closed-loop production process that reuses 99.",
              "5% of the water and dissolving agents.",
              "Since others may not use this closed-loop manufacturing process (a critical component to lyocell\u2019s sustainability), how can you tell which are sustainable fabrics?",
              "Seek out TENCELTM clothing brands for those who are transparent about their sourcing and manufacturing practices.",
              "Modal fabric is another semi-synthetic fabric known for comfort and breathability.",
              "As an affordable silk alternative, it\u2019s a popular choice for drapey garments like fair trade dresses.",
              "Just as lyocell is made from eucalyptus wood pulp, modal is made from beech trees.",
              "While less wasteful and chemically-intensive than traditional rayon/ viscose production, its chemicals are more caustic than those used for lyocell manufacturing.",
              "As with lyocell, it\u2019s not always done in a closed-loop system either, meaning again you should seek out transparent users of lyocell or opt for carbon-neutral TENCELTM modal.",
              "Bamboo lyocell is also made in a closed-loop manufacturing process that reuses chemicals and water, but like regular lyocell, bamboo is not always made this way.",
              "All bamboo viscose does inherently mean it\u2019s closed-loop bamboo lyocell.",
              "While both require chemicals to plasticize the wood pulp into silky fibers, a closed-loop process ensures they get recycled.",
              "Bamboo lyocell also utilizes fewer toxic chemicals.",
              "A few brands making bamboo pajamas and bamboo socks use this more sustainable way of processing, but it\u2019s important to do a double-take at transparency whenever bamboo is involved.",
              "Lenzing\u2019s new sustainable fabric joining their line of semi-synthetics is ECOVEROTM.",
              "Responsible for 50% fewer carbon emissions and water use than standard viscose, these fibers come from varied sustainable wood and pulp sources and meet the highest environmental standards.",
              "As with anything TENCELTM, you can rest assured it was made using closed-loop processes.",
              "Cactus leather is not the only prickly plant fibre on this list.",
              "Pin\u0303atex, a creation of the sustainable fabrics supplier Ananas Anam, uses pineapples to create a cruelty-free replacement for leather.",
              "Not only that, but it\u2019s a food industry byproduct, made from scrap pineapple leaves that are otherwise burned.",
              "Pin\u0303atex in its best sustainable fabric form utilizes wood-based PLA resins to add durability (meaning the whole thing can biodegrade), but some brands cover Pin\u0303atex with non-biodegradable resins to be avoided if possible.",
              "An award-winning new kid on the plant pulp fabric block, Bananatex\u00ae has the potential to become one of the best sustainable fabrics if widely adopted.",
              "It starts with byproduct stalks of organically-grown Abaca\u0301 banana plants grown in the Philippine highlands.",
              "They\u2019re not only self-sufficient plants, but are used to reforest and increase biodiversity in areas previously damaged by monoculture palm oil plantations.",
              "Unlike some of the other plant-based vegan leathers that still use plastic coatings to waterproof, Bananatex\u00ae uses only beeswax.",
              "If you doubt its positive end-of-life prospects, its Cradle to Cradle\u00ae Gold certification can allay those fears.",

              "As opposed to our current linear model of fashion production with environmental impacts at every stage, where resources are consumed, turned into a product, then discarded, sustainable fashion minimizes its environmental impact, and even aims to benefit the environment.",

              "One-quarter of respondents to our survey indicated that they are concerned about sustainability-related issues (Exhibit 1).",
              "These consumers go out of their way to buy secondhand items and to look for clothing made with environmentally friendly material, such as recycled polyester.",
              "Our research shows that this group, which is willing to pay 15 percent more for sustainable options, is more likely to consist of urban millennial women with moderate to high incomes (Exhibit 2).",
              "The factors that these sustainability seekers care most about are the lowering of GHG emissions, the preservation of natural habitats for animals, practices that dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t harm animals, and the use of renewable energy (Exhibit 3).",
              "In contrast, about half of our survey respondents were ambivalent about sustainability, while another one-quarter emerged as a strong counterbalancing contingent.",

              "No shared understanding exists among consumers (or brands) about what exactly a\u0302\u0080\u009csustainabilitya\u0302\u0080\u009d means, which features matter most, or where to find information about a particular branda\u0302\u0080\u0099s sustainability commitment.",
              "It can be even harder to find independent sources that help distinguish between authentic sustainability claims and greenwashing.",
              "Fashion brands have a significant opportunity to deliver clear, straightforward information on their practices (both at and before the point of sale), as well as frictionless postpurchase options that consumers can use to mitigate the impact of their fashion choices.",
              "Fashion brands have a significant opportunity to deliver clear, straightforward information on their practices.",
              "Although most consumers in our survey said that sustainability does not actively influence their purchasing decisions, responses were different when we asked about an itema\u0302\u0080\u0099s end of life.",
              "Only 24 percent of respondents said they go out of their way to buy products from sustainable brands, while some 46 percent of consumers said they would want to purchase items that could be easily donated to charity (Exhibit 5).",
              "This finding highlights a fertile landscape for the development of circular business models.",
              "Because fashion will always be driven by a desire to seek novelty, a sustainability paradox is inevitable: in our survey, the consumers most engaged with sustainability are also those most likely to generate waste by renewing their wardrobes every season (Exhibit 6).",
              "To create more value for these shoppers, brands can design their products to be repurposed once a consumer is finished with them.",
              "This sustainable loop, if managed well, would lessen consumersa\u0302\u0080\u0099 dependence on entirely new products, allow companies to do more with less, and reduce the fashion industrya\u0302\u0080\u0099s planetary impact.",
              "As the fashion and textile industries strive to reduce their environmental footprint and consumers grow increasingly aware of our changing climate, we expect consumersa\u0302\u0080\u0099 desires for sustainable fashion to grow.",
              "Brands that help people to understand and mitigate the impact of their fashion choices place themselves in a leadership role on this important issue and in a stronger position to drive sustainable growth."

              "The platform is actively renting 19,000 of the garments it launched with in 2019, in large part thanks to its repair program.",
              "Many mass-market brands, by contrast, churn out garments that are either low-quality, and thus fall apart, or that are so trendy that they quickly look outdated, sending customers back to the store for the latest thing.",
              "This style of production also limits the potential of rental and resale, Lennon notes, because flimsier garments aren\u2019t built to last through multiple cycles of ownership.",
              "A \u201ccombination of physical durability, emotional durability, and designing to be remade and recycled is really critical to develop circular business models,\u201d Lennon says.",

              "There\u2019s probably some reverse psychology at play here: by owning its shortcomings, Patagonia boosts its reputation and becomes a brand people want to support.",
              "Aileen Ottenweller, the company\u2019s head of brand and business impact, acknowledges that buzzy campaigns do sometimes lead to spikes in sales\u2014but she also maintains there\u2019s a genuine recognition within Patagonia that \u201ceverything we make has a footprint [and] we are in an environment where we cannot sustain the amount of things being made.",
