    "query": "What is the most significant breakthrough in gene therapy, and how may it transform the treatment of genetic diseases in the future?",
    "response": "Gene therapy is a promising field of medicine that aims to treat or cure genetic diseases by delivering corrected versions of faulty genes to the affected cells or tissues. There have been many breakthroughs in gene therapy in recent years, but one of the most recent and significant ones is the use of **CRISPR**, a gene-editing technique that allows precise and targeted modifications of DNA[^3^].\n\nCRISPR has been used to treat patients with sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, two inherited blood disorders, by editing their stem cells outside the body and then infusing them back[^3^]. But this approach is limited by the availability and quality of the stem cells, and the risk of immune rejection. A more direct and efficient way of using CRISPR is to deliver it systemically into the bloodstream, where it can reach any cell or tissue that needs fixing.\n\nThis is what a team of researchers did for six patients with **transthyretin amyloidosis**, a rare and fatal disease caused by a mutated protein that accumulates in various organs[^3^]. They used a harmless virus to carry the CRISPR gene-editing tool into the patients' livers, where the faulty protein is produced. The CRISPR tool then cut out the mutated gene, reducing the levels of the toxic protein by up to 87%[^3^]. This is the first time that CRISPR has been used to edit genes inside the body of patients with a systemic disease.\n\nThis breakthrough opens the door to treating a broad array of genetic diseases that affect different tissues and organs, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and Huntington's disease[^3^]. It also demonstrates the safety and efficacy of CRISPR as a gene therapy tool that can be delivered through the bloodstream. However, more research and clinical trials are needed to confirm the long-term benefits and risks of this approach, and to optimize the delivery and dosage of CRISPR for different diseases.",

              "As little as 2\u20135 % of donor chimerism post allogeneic transplantation is adequate to ameliorate SCD-related symptoms in patients with SCD, thus providing the rationale for a gene therapy approach [8,15].",
              "Thus, successful gene addition or correction in relatively few HSCs could translate into a clinically meaningful level of RBC chimerism in the peripheral blood [16].",
              "In the last two decades, gene therapy for SCD using a lentiviral-vector has proven to be curative in preclinical and clinical studies.",
              "The first patient with SCD treated with lentiviral vector\u2013mediated addition of an antisickling HBB into autologous HSCs was successful, demonstrating a high level of therapeutic antisickling \u03b2-globin 15 months after treatment [14].",
              "A self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector encoding the human anti-sickling HBB, LentiGlobin, is currently being evaluated for safety and efficacy in clinical trials [17].",
              "However, the use of lentiviral vectors poses potential risks such as generation of a replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) capable of infecting non-target cells, and insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal dominance and genotoxicity [18].",
              "Although the recent results from the lentiviral gene therapy clinical trials provide the promise of ex vivo engineering of autologous HSPCs, longer follow-up is required to confirm the durability of the safety and efficacy of lentiviral-vector based gene therapy for SCD.",

              "In a healthy adult, the overall hemoglobin composition is 97 % adult hemoglobin (HbA, \u03b12\u03b22), 3 % or less HbA2 (\u03b12\u03b4 2), and up to 1 % HbF (HbF, \u03b12\u03b32).",
              "HPFH is a benign condition caused by mutations within the \u03b2-globin gene cluster, which results in elevated HbF levels in adulthood [37].",

              "With an improved understanding of the globin locus regulation, there is considerable interest in developing approaches to induce HbF expression for therapeutic purposes.",
              "HbF induction can be achieved by silencing transcription factors such as B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) that mediate silencing of HBG after birth [38] or mimicking beneficial HPFH mutations [39].",

              "A gene-editing strategy using engineered nucleases such as TAL-effector nucleases (TALENs), zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 systems, creates a DNA double-strand break (DSB) at a user-defined location.",
              "The technology offers the potential to permanently repair disease-causing mutations through correction, deletion, addition, and disruption of the specific sequences mediated by targeted DSB generation followed by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) [19].",
              "ZFNs and TALENs have distinct DNA binding domains, and both utilize the FokI endonuclease domain for cleaving the DNA [41].",
              "However, the programming of these nucleases is complicated, time-consuming, and requires significant expertise.",
              "The class of programmable nuclease that has proved the most versatile and effective in recent years is the CRISPR/Cas9 system.",
              "CRISPR/Cas9 utilizes single guide RNA sequences (gRNA) that bind to a specific target site in the genome and to the Cas9 endonuclease.",
              "The Cas9 endonuclease is guided to a specific target site by homology between the gRNA and the target DNA sequences.",
              "Although the off-target effect remains a potential issue, it can be significantly reduced by rational gRNA designs or utilizing high-fidelity Cas9 protein [42].",
              "Base editors are created by fusing a nucleotide deaminase with catalytically disabled Cas9 protein.",
              "Base editors directly convert one base into another without inducing DSBs and therefore not relying on HDR, enabling the point mutation correction in non-dividing cells.",
              "Therefore, base editors are a promising DNA editing tool and considered to be preferable to using Cas9 nuclease which may lead to the generation of unwanted small insertions/deletions (indels), translocations, or chromosomal rearrangements [43].",
              "With the advancement of gene-editing technologies, each of the four technologies (ZFNs, TALENs, CRISPR/Cas9, base editor) have been tested in HSPCs for treating SCD.",

              "Similar to insertional mutagenesis associated with integrating vector systems, inadvertent on-target and off-target effects evoked by the genome editing tools represent a major concern when applied in patient cells, particularly in highly proliferating multipotent stem cells.",
              "On the one hand, cleavage by CRISPR-Cas nucleases can trigger undesired effects on the target chromosome (50, 51), such as large deletions and inversions (52\u201354), chromosomal truncations (55), chromothripsis (56), aneuploidy (57), loss of heterozygosity (58), and loss of imprinting (58).",
              "On the other hand, unintentional activity at so-called off-target sites, that is sequences with high homology to the intended target site, triggers NHEJ-mediated insertion/deletion mutations at off-target sites and, potentially, comparable structural aberrations as described for the on-target site.",
              "Moreover, concomitant insertions of DSBs at multiple sites in the genome elicit translocations between those cleaved sites (54, 59).",

Commonly used in vitro methods include CIRCLE-Seq (60), ONE-Seq (61) and NucleaSeq (62), while GUIDE-Seq (63), DISCOVER-Seq (64) and CAST-Seq (54) are prevalently used cell-based approaches.",
              "Noteworthy, CAST-Seq not only nominates off-target sites but also detects chromosomal rearrangements at the on-target site as well as induced chromosomal translocations with off-target sites (54).",
              "The gene-edited products that are currently employed in clinical trials typically underwent several genotoxicity tests as part of the preclinical risk assessment.",
              "For instance, off-target activities of the CRISPR-Cas nucleases used in CTX001 and GPH101 were profiled by GUIDE-Seq, CIRCLE-Seq, and targeted amplicon next-generation sequencing (Amp-Seq) of in silico predicted off-target sites.",
              "Similarly, the safety of EDIT301 was investigated with GUIDE-Seq and Amp-Seq of in silico predicted off-target sites.",
              "Given that translocations are a hallmark of leukemic cells (65, 66) and since they can be rather frequent outcomes of genome editing (54, 59, 67, 68), there is a growing interest in detecting gross structural rearrangements, such as large chromosomal deletions, inversions, truncations, and translocations, too.",
              "To our knowledge, many of the above-mentioned products did not undergo a genome-wide and sensitive analysis of induced chromosomal rearrangements.",
              "Against the backdrop of the high sequence similarities within the \u03b2-globin locus (HBG1 vs. HBG2 or HBB vs. HBD), the potential for off-target editing as well as homology-mediated recombination between two respective paralogous genes is high (69).",
              "Indeed, rearrangements between HBB and HBD were confirmed in HBB-edited cell, in addition to translocations between HBB and an off-target site (54, 70, 71).",
              "In addition, CRISPR-Cas nucleases targeting either HBB, HBD or HBG1/HBG2 can lead to complete loss of the distal chromosome 11p arm in HSCs (58).",
              "Furthermore, the simultaneous disruption of the BCL11 binding sites in HBG1 and HBG2 was reported to result in deletion of the 4.",
              "9 kb region between the two target sites, eliminating HBG2 in 5\u201330% of cells (72\u201374).",
              "To avoid this loss of the HBG2 gene, BEs were employed to introduce HPFH-like mutations in the HBG1/HBG2 promoters (75).",
              "Because single-strand nicks are repaired by the high-fidelity base-excision repair pathway, BEs have been claimed to reduce on-target and off-target effects (36).",
              "However, recent data demonstrated deletion of a 4.",
              "9 kb region after base editing of the HBG1/HBG2 promoters, indicating that also base editing can induce structural variations (76).",
              "Furthermore, bystander editing effects (77) and gRNA-independent off-target activities on both DNA and RNA (78, 79) have been described for both ABEs and CBEs.",
              "Hence, additional efforts are needed to characterize BE-associated off-target effects as well as to identify gross chromosomal rearrangements triggered by editing tools in HSCs of SCD (and TDT) patients.",
              "This also includes the evaluation of the biological long-term effects of genotoxicity in transplanted patients as well as the development of strategies to mitigate the observed off-target effects.",
              "Genotoxic conditioning regimens still pose a major barrier to the adoption of autologous HSC transplantation in SCD (80, 81).",
              "To overcome this problem, Beam Therapeutic, among others, is developing a new approach termed \u201cengineered stem cell antibody paired evasion,\u201d in which a BE-introduced epitope switch in CD117 enables those CD117-edited HSCs to selectively escape CD117-directed antibody-based conditioning.",
              "Such a strategy can be easily applied to BEAM-101 by targeting CD117 and the HBG1/2 promoters simultaneously (82).",
              "Are there additional transcription factors that could be targeted to upregulate \u03b3-globin expression?",
              "MYB is a transcription factor that regulates fetal hemoglobin expression at multiple levels, including upregulation of BCL11A expression (83).",
              "ATF4 is further upstream and regulates the expression of MYB.",
              "It has been recently shown that knockout of ATF4 lowered MYB\u2014and hence BCL11A\u2014expression, and could thus potentially re-activate \u03b3-globin expression (84).",
              "However, it must be noted that MYB and ATF4 have multiple functions outside of HbF regulation in non-erythroid cells (85, 86), highlighting the need to identify erythroid-specific regulation.",
              "Given the constraints of off-target effects associated with all genome editing platforms, the question is whether alternatives to genome editing are available.",
              "Several studies deciphered the epigenetic regulation of the \u03b2-globin locus during development, including the interaction between epigenetic and transcriptional regulation leading to repression of \u03b3-globin expression (87, 88).",
              "This knowledge opened up the idea to modify the epigenome in a targeted fashion for the treatment of SCD.",
              "While epigenetic approaches to promote \u03b3-globin re-expression were described before (89, 90), more specific approaches are needed for clinical translation.",

              "Epigenome modifiers might therefore have less deleterious effects in a cell.",
              "On the other hand, the challenge of maintaining long-lasting effects over several cell cycles and throughout lineage differentiation has not been solved yet and it will be interesting to see whether the potential of designer epigenome modifiers can be harnessed for the treatment of SCD in the near future (93, 94).",

              "This phenomenon is believed to enable immediate diffusion of nitric oxide into the blood vessels to promote vasodilation in contracting muscles, allowing sufficient blood perfusion [19].",
              "The delocalisation of nNOS due to absence of functional dystrophin has been proposed to cause (i) functional ischaemia and (ii) nitrosative stress that damages cells, compromising force production in the muscle [19].",
              "The DAPC consists of multiple transmembrane, cytoplasmic and extracellular proteins and in DMD patients, the absence of functional dystrophin destabilises the DAPC [20, 21].",

              "Many proteins found within the DAPC including alpha-dystrobrevin, sarcoglycan, dystroglycan, and sarcospan are essential components in cellular signalling that maintain healthy muscle function and development [10], and when mutated are associated with distinct muscular dystrophies in their own right.",
              "In the absence of functional dystrophin in skeletal and cardiac muscle, the integrity of muscle cell membrane (also known as sarcolemma) is proposed to be affected, making the muscle fibers more prone to damage induced by contractile activity [23].",
              "The absence of functional dystrophin protein due to mutations in the DMD gene leads to progressive muscle wasting in patients, with loss of myofibers and replacement with fatty and fibrotic tissue [24].",

              "Like DMD, BMD is also caused by mutations in the same X-linked gene, however the disease is much milder than DMD and the age of onset of BMD can be as late as 30 or 40 years [25].",
              "The transcript reading frame flanking mutations is not disturbed in BMD but the aberrant transcripts code for shorter dystrophins forms that are partially and variably functional, and often with reduced expression and/or stability [11].",
              "In patients with deletion mutations, the \u2018reading frame\u2019 hypothesis suggests that semi-functional, internally deleted dystrophin proteins are produced in BMD patients giving rise to a less severe form of dystrophinopathy [26].",
              "One striking case study has revealed a 61-year old BMD patient who was still ambulant even though 46% of the coding information was lost in the deletion in his DMD gene [25].",
              "On the other hand, the \u2018reading frame\u2019 hypothesis suggests that in DMD patients, a truncated protein that is unstable is produced, causing the more severe form of dystrophinopathy [26].",
              "An analysis of 258 independent deletion mutations at the DMD/BMD locus revealed that there was a correlation between phenotype and type of deletion mutations in 92% of cases;",
              "and in fact, many \u201cin-frame\u201d deletions of the DMD gene are not detected as the individuals with such mutations are either asymptomatic or exhibit non-DMD/non-BMD clinical features [26].",
              "This finding was not only intriguing suggesting size of deletions in the DMD gene are not necessarily related to severity of the disease, but also revealed the possibility of manipulating and engineering the large DMD transcript in several gene therapy and antisense strategies to restore muscle function in affected patients.",

              "Nineteen years later in 1984, AAV was vectorised for the purpose of gene transfer [30].",
              "Eleven years following this, the viral vector was first used in a cystic fibrosis human patient in 1995 [31].",
              "Fast forwarding the timeline, the EMA approved the first AAV-based gene therapy drug Glybera for the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in 2012 [32], followed by the approval of Luxturna by the FDA in 2017 for the treatment of an inherited retinal disease [33] and another FDA approval of Zolgensma in 2019 for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy [34].",
              "A further breakthrough in the field came when Samulski and colleagues described a method for the production of recombinant AAV (rAAV) using a so-called two-plasmid system, where the final virus stock contained no wild type AAV (wtAAV) [35].",
              "In this system the rep and cap genes on the wtAAV genome are replaced with genes of interest to produce rAAV [36].",
              "The virus inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), are however required in cis for replication and packaging of rAAV [37] and as such, the ITRs are the only sequences of wtAAV origin that are incorporated into rAAV [29].",
              "The rep, cap and helper virus genes are provided in trans [37].",
              "Importantly, and unlike the wtAAV, recombinant AAVs do not undergo site-specific integration into the human chromosome AAVS1 locus, and the bulk of rAAV genomes exist as extra-chromosomal episomes in transduced cells [38].",
              "This very robust and popular method of rAAV production is via plasmid transfection of adherent human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, where the transgene in between ITRs is delivered in cis and the rep, cap and helper genes are delivered in trans [29].",
              "A modified version of this method is suspension culture of HEK293 that allows rapid production of rAAV and scaling-up the yield which are essential in clinical applications [39].",
              "Following production, rAAVs are purified via either column chromatography or gradient centrifugation;",
              "and it is worth mentioning that the purity differs based on the method used which can impact the outcome of preclinical and clinical studies [40].",

              "Variations between studies pose some difficulties in precisely establishing AAV serotype tissue tropism [42].",
              "The tropism of the viral capsids are largely due to presence of respective viral receptors on target cells, which can vary between species [43, 44].",
              "The difference in receptor expression between species causes variations in potency of different AAV capsids, a fact that is sometimes overlooked in translational studies [44].",
              "The mRNA ORF coding sequence of the DMD gene is some 11.",
              "5 kb long and this large size poses a huge challenge in devising gene transfer therapies [19].",
              "The observations made in BMD patients have however suggested that transfer of full-length dystrophin ORF may not be obligatory in developing a gene therapy and the disease phenotype may be alleviated with a smaller gene construct [25].",
              "Whilst AAVs possess many desirable qualities for use in muscle gene therapy, the small virus is only capable of packaging genomes and transgenes of limited size (respectively \u223c4.",

              "Whilst mouse models have been extremely useful in proof-of-principle studies, they fail to capture the magnitude of potential immune response caused by AAV delivery, often times raising no safety concerns in the studies [19].",
              "The first barrier posed by the immune system is against rAAV capsids, similar to wtAAV, by producing neutralising antibodies (NAbs) that will eventually prevent gene delivery by rAAV [29].",
              "Approximately 80% of the human population are estimated to be seropositive for AAV due to natural exposure to the virus [69], which will enable them to develop NAbs following such exposure [70].",
              "Vector immunogenicity could thus arise from such pre-existing neutralising anti-capsid antibodies and also from cells that have been successfully transduced by rAAV, where the rAAV capsid antigens are displayed on the MHC-I complex, eliciting cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response [40].",
              "While studies involving mouse models have shown promising results, the AAV capsid and transgene product however seem to elicit cytotoxic T cell response in larger animal models such as dogs [71], which are better and more sensitive models to predict potential adverse immune responses against AAV gene therapy [62].",
              "Systemic AAV gene delivery of high doses of \u223c1013 to 1014 vector genomes/kg have also been shown to elicit the activation of the innate immune response in large animal models [19].",
              "In dystrophin-deficient neonatal dog model, in one study, two pups treated at 4-day-old had to be euthanised at 16 weeks of age as toxicity related to innate immune response were observed [72].",
              "Another alert came from studies in juvenile non-human primates (NHPs) and piglets, where all three piglets and one NHP were euthanised due to observed toxicity and the remaining two NHPs demonstrated elevated level of transaminase (liver enzyme) and thrombocytopenia (platelet deficiency in blood) [73].",
              "It is also important to note that none of these studies have clearly demonstrated strong evidence supporting a cellular immune response [19].",
              "The determinants of immunogenicity of AAV vectors are still unclear, but the likelihood of AAV causing an immune response is high and should not be underestimated [74].",
              "If AAV delivery elicits cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune responses, this would cause short-lived gene expression [74, 75].",
              "This CTL-mediated immune response following AAV transduction leading to clearance of transduced cells would pose a problem in the clinical setting as efficient gene therapy requires stable, long-term expression of the therapeutic gene [29, 74].",
              "In the case of AAVs targeted to the skeletal muscles, the effects of CTL-mediated immune responses may not be as detrimental as previously thought due to the role played by regulatory T (Treg) cells in suppressing the effect of CTLs [76].",
              "A study by Mueller et al.",
              ", 2013 [76] also reported persistent, long-term transgene expression for up to 12 months and as such, immunomodulation of T cell populations may not be needed for muscle-directed AAV gene delivery.",
              "In addition, healthy skeletal muscle cells have low expression of MHC I and this could also contribute to the reduced T-lymphocyte mediated immune response [74].",
              "In another clinical case, skeletal muscle samples from a patient with severe haemophilia B, that was injected with human factor IX-encoding AAV tested positive for factor IX 10 years post-treatment [77].",
              "Following AAV administration, the innate immune system can also provoke a deleterious adaptive immune response via the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-MyD88 pathway [78].",
              "The activation of the TLR9-MyD88 pathway can result in a cytokine storm that induces the production of type I interferons [79].",
              "TLR9 is a pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) that binds to unmethylated CpG sequence clusters, and CG content is significantly raised in codon optimised AAV vector genomes [80].",
              "Self-complimentary genomes are shown to cause a stronger TLR9-dependent immune response in a dose-dependent manner [81].",
              "Such dose dependent innate immune response eventually initiated adaptive immune response against the viral capsid and against the transgene [81].",
              "CpG depletion from rAAV vector genomes [82] and improvements in vector production strategy by artificially increasing CpG methylation could alleviate these issues around the innate immune response against AAV [80].",
              "The barrier posed by NAbs can potentially be overcome by some of the strategies currently being developed such as plasmapheresis, capsid engineering and using empty capsids as decoys [29].",
              "Nevertheless, excluding seropositive patients from the trials is currently the only practical strategy in overcoming issues related to NAbs [19].",
              "In the case of DMD, glucocorticosteroids (GCs) that are widely used as standard of care [83] also help in managing some of the immune system complications through the immunomodulatory activities of these drugs [84].",
              "High vector doses in AAV gene therapy could potentially elicit undesirable immune responses, however, such high doses are also effective in rescuing the disease phenotype [72].",
              "AAV gene therapy in a canine model of X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM) showed great improvements in muscle strength and survival of the dogs in a dose-dependent manner, where the highest survival was observed in the group receiving the highest dose of rAAV expressing the therapeutic gene myotubularin (MTM1) [85].",
              "However, high capsid dose could also trigger unwanted immune response;",
              "therefore, a balance needs to be achieved between the capsid dose and therapeutic efficacy for a good clinical outcome [74].",
              "Recent human clinical trial of MTM gene therapy utilising AAV8 reported three deaths in the high dose group further reiterating the need for carefully managing vector dose for safety and therapeutic efficacy [86].",
              "It is also a reminder that both in positive and sadly negative senses the most crucial data in the field of gene therapy are indeed derived from human studies, as pre-clinical studies pose some limitations in capturing the full effects of a treatment.",
              "The choice of appropriate AAV serotype in targeting the respective tissues is also crucial in clinical outcome as they may directly influence the dosage needed in treatment.",
              "Care should also be taken as some AAV serotypes that efficiently transduce tissues in one mouse strain may not show similar transduction profile in another mouse strain, non-human primates or humans potentially due to molecular differences between the strains/ species [87].",
              "In the case of muscle gene transfer, previously, the most commonly utilized route to administer AAV vectors is via direct intramuscular (IM) injection [71].",
              "Multiple studies however have shown that large doses of vectors injected at one site such as the muscle can potentially trigger immune response against the transgene [75].",
              "The route of delivery is changing over the years as human clinical trials are currently being planned and conducted using systemic intravascular (IV) administration to deliver the gene therapy products [9, 62, 72, 88, 89].",
              "The intravenous (IV) route of vector delivery enables in principle body wide transduction that is essential in any comprehensive gene therapy of muscle diseases affecting all or many of the 700 muscles in the human.",
              "However a large vector dose delivered systemically could potentially trigger severe innate and adaptive immune responses towards the viral capsid [75].",
              "Careful planning, selection and safety trial escalation of the vector dose is indicated.",
              "However, conventional dose escalation is problematic since patients treated with sub-clinical doses may become immunised and thus ineligible or refractive to subsequent clinical dosing.",
              "This is a difficult ethical conundrum and careful selection of early phase clinical trial dosing based on preclinical data is necessary to ensure patients are safe but may yet benefit.",
              "Concerns regarding genotoxicity have emerged as in certain circumstances there seems to be a dose-dependent correlation between AAV gene delivery and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), indicating that increasing the AAV dosage could increase genotoxicity [90].",
              "Theoretically, both the wtAAV and rAAV containing transgene could integrate part or all of their genome into the host genomic DNA, perhaps disrupting or activating oncogenic genes and thus predisposing patients to the formation of cancer [91].",
              "This genotoxic phenomenon with AAV vectors however seems more prominent in rodent models and was not very much evident in larger animal models such as dogs and nonhuman primates [40].",
              "Patients in human clinical trials for haemophilia-B that have received AAV gene therapy (>9 years post gene transfer) have not developed any tumors so far [92].",
              "Studies investigating location of integration events that originated from rAAV genome have also reported no genotoxicity of systemically administered rAAV in non-human primates and humans [93].",
              "Although no genotoxic safety concerns have been raised so far in humans, this is a risk that should remain on the radar in AAV gene therapy studies and extended periods of follow-up are still recommended [40].",
              "Stable, long-term transgene expression is a key in achieving therapeutic efficacy following AAV gene therapy and this is even more important in chronic diseases such as DMD that requires continuous expression of modified dystrophin [19].",
              "The biggest challenges in enabling persistent transgene expression are the muscle regeneration characteristic of the illness and immune responses to AAV capsid and transgene.",
              "Immunosuppression may partially resolve the immune responses, and other approaches to evade the immune responses such as tolerance induction may also be beneficial [44].",
              "In post-mitotic and slowly replicating adult tissues, persistence may be achieved and when translating observations from studies in animal models to humans, it is essential to note the difference in turnover rates of different tissues in different species [40].",
              "It has been shown that in healthy muscle AAV-mediated transgene delivery may persist for over a decade.",
              "However, in DMD, if transgene expression is below the threshold necessary for disease prevention then myofibre degeneration and regeneration will result in gradual elimination of episomal transgenes and micro-dystrophin expression.",
              "In addition to these considerations with DMD, there is the requirement for near body-wide muscle and heart transduction, and myoblast-mediated growth of patients treated at an early age.",
              "It is thus very likely that repeat administration of any DMD gene therapy will be needed.",
              "However, the required interval between treatments and the mechanism of managing the presence of circulating AAV NAbs induced by primary treatment remain as yet to be determined [19].",
              "DMD is a lethal paediatric genetic disease and so far, there is no cure for this disease.",
              "Many therapeutic strategies are being tested in clinical trials but AAV gene therapy shows the most promising success so far [94, 95].",
              "AAV gene therapy also has the potential of treating the majority of the DMD patient population regardless of genotype.",
              "As microdystrophin gene transfer using AAV has been proven to be widely effective in preclinical models and to be relatively safe in early clinical trials [55], the focus of the research now is geared towards successfully translating this ATMP from bench to bedside, looking at issues around dose levels, repeat treatment, immune modulation and pharmaceutical scale manufacture and supply.",
              "Of these several issues still remaining to be tackled in AAV gene therapy and one is potency and efficacy [40].",
              "The systemic nature of DMD that requires body-wide dystrophin restoration also means a high AAV dosage may be needed to treat this disease.",
              "Whilst AAV is a safe virus, it can still provoke adverse immune responses at a high dosage [74].",
              "This would then reduce the efficacy of the treatment.",
              "A more potent gene expression cassette would mean in theory that less virus will be needed to achieve therapeutic effect.",
              "One way of enhancing gene expression is via addition of gene regulatory elements such as novel promoters and introns [96] into the gene expression cassette.",
              "Apart from making the therapy safer due to reduced chances of provoking the immune system, a more potent gene expression cassette would also contribute to solving the challenge in AAV manufacturing at a large scale, as less virus will be needed to treat each patient.",
              "This in turn could also bring the cost of therapy down, as currently even the \u2018cheapest\u2019 AAV gene therapy drug carries a six-digit price tag.",
              "Since rAAVs first were mooted to have clinical gene therapy promise more than 20 years ago, there has been a constant pursuit to generate and isolate novel AAV capsids with new properties [29].",
              "As AAV gene therapy is actively moving into human clinical trials, there is a constant need and desire to improve the virus properties in terms of transduction efficiency, tissue tropism and immunogenicity [97].",
              "In the case of DMD, an AAV serotype that is muscle-tropic and preferentially transfers gene into muscle cells would be ideal [98], especially because currently, a high dosage to achieve body-wide transduction is needed to treat DMD.",
              "Delivering therapeutic constructs using muscle-specific AAVs will improve the clinical outcome of the treatments.",
              "In addition, a lower dosage will be required for treatment, reducing potential immune response and also inevitably reducing the cost of treatment.",
              "It should be noted that, poorly understood and even perhaps as yet unidentified;",

              "Currently, GCs are routinely used prophylactically or reactively to control elevated serum levels of liver marker enzymes commonly considered to result from autoimmune reactivity to AAV transduced hepatocytes and appears to be a successful strategy in young patients.",
              "Several alternative immunomodulatory drug regimens are also being evaluated to either suppress existing or dose-reactive AAV immunity which may allow primary dosing in AAV seropositive individuals or re-dosing of gene therapies [101, 102].",
              "The prevention, circumvention or control of adverse immunity is an area of ongoing research both clinically and in animal model systems which is crucial to the future development of the AAV gene therapy field in general.",
              "In addition, despite the fact that the current microdystrophins in clinical trial have been shown to be highly effective in rodent and canine models of DMD [9, 50, 103], and with indications of safety and some clinical benefit in humans (Table 1), it remains a formal possibility that they will prove less effective in the context of human clinical trials.",
              "Only time will tell, but it seems unlikely that current AAV-microdystrophins and current dose administration regimens with lead to a complete disease remission.",
              "The AAV gene therapy field is expanding exponentially, and we are just at the beginning of an important era [29].",
              "Other therapies such as exon skipping, stop codon readthrough, novel steroids, anti-inflammatories and anti-fibrotics may also prove beneficial, although sometimes only to a proportion of DMD patients that carry specific mutations, but there is nevertheless the realistic potential of combinations of therapies to achieve greater clinical efficacy.",

              "Furthermore, the cargo must reach the target tissue and bypass the vascular endothelium, which are often tightly connected by cell-cell junctions (101), preventing accessibility to larger delivery vehicles (>1 nm diameter).",
              "Additionally, once the cargo has reached the target cells, they must be internalized, which is generally facilitated through endocytosis where they can be transported and degraded by lysosomal enzymes (102).",

              "A variety of efficient Cas9 variants and derivatives have been developed to cope with the complex genomic changes that occur during diseases.",
              "However, strategies to effectively deliver the CRISPR system to diseased cells in vivo are currently lacking, and nonviral vectors with target recognition functions may be the focus of future research.",
              "Pathological and physiological changes resulting from disease onset are expected to serve as identifying factors for targeted delivery or targets for gene editing.",
              "Diseases are both varied and complex, and the choice of appropriate gene-editing methods and delivery vectors for different diseases is important.",
              "Meanwhile, there are still many potential challenges identified when targeting delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for disease treatment.",

              "1,2 Many diseases are accompanied by changes in gene expression in vivo, particularly some genetic diseases caused by mutations in a single gene, and gene-editing technology is expected to control the occurrence of diseases at the genetic level.",
              "3 To date, gene-editing technology has undergone three main generations of development: the first generation of gene-editing technology was zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs);",
              "the second generation was transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs);",
              "and the most widely used third generation gene-editing technology is clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas).",
              "4 Unlike ZFNs and TALENs, which use proteins to target DNA strands, CRISPR technology directs Cas proteins to a specified location in the genome by changing the base sequence of a small segment of guide RNA, thus improving the efficiency of gene editing and expanding the applicability of gene-editing technology.",
              "5 CRISPR/ Cas9 is a highly effective gene-editing tool that is widely used in the scientific community.",
              "6 The CRISPR/Cas9 system evolved naturally in bacteria and archaea as a defense mechanism against phage infection and plasmid transfer.",
              "7,8 Bacteria or archaea acquire a segment of their DNA sequence to insert into the CRISPR spacer region when first infiltrated by an exogenous phage or plasmid.",
              "If reinfected with homologous DNA, the bacterium will initiate transcription of the CRISPR region.",
              "After a series of processing and maturation processes to generate a single guide RNA (sgRNA), the sgRNA guides Cas9 to shear the DNA strand that disrupts the homologous spacer region.",
              "The recognition process of the sgRNA requires the involvement of protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs), a short guanine-enriched sequence.",
              "9 The preferred PAM by Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) is NGG, which is common in the genomes of most organisms, thereby facilitating the use of CRISPR technology across the fields of plant and animal science, together with biomedicine.",
              "10,11,12,13,14 By changing the nucleotide sequence of a small segment of guide RNA, CRISPR/Cas9 allows the accurate targeting of almost any desired genomic locus for the purpose of correcting disease-causing mutations or silencing genes associated with disease onset.",
              "5,15 However, some highly chromatinized regions in the genome may not be accessible to CRISPR/Cas9.",
              "Promising applications for this technology include the treatment of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, sickle cell anemia, and neurodegenerative disease.",
              "16,17,18,19 Wild-type Cas9 only cuts double-stranded DNA to form double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are repaired through DNA repair mechanisms, namely, homology-directed repair (HDR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ).",
              "20,21,22 The base sequence of the original gene is damaged, resulting in inactivation, but the inactivation of a single deleterious gene cannot address the complex processes of all disease events.",
              "23 Therefore, researchers searched for possible ways to modify Cas9 by elucidating the physicochemical structure of Cas9, the mechanism of action by which Cas9 cleaves double chains, and other properties.",
              "They endowed Cas9 with new functions by mutating the structural domain of Cas9 and introducing effectors, including transcriptional regulatory tools such as dead Cas9 (dCas9) effectors and single-base substitution tools such as cytosine base editors (CBEs), adenine base editors (ABEs), and prime editors (PEs).",
              "Moreover, RNA recognition and cleavage functions can be performed by Cas13a isolated from Leptotrichia shahii.",
              "24,25,26,27,28 These Cas9 variants and derivatives enrich the gene-editing paradigm and can be adapted to additional types of diseases.",
              "Although several experiments have documented the use of gene-editing technology to modify cells in vitro for return to the body to treat some diseases, this approach is not applicable to most disease types.",
              "Achieving stable, efficient, and safe delivery in vivo is a challenge that must be overcome before CRISPR technology becomes a common treatment modality.",
              "CRISPR systems such as plasmid DNA (pDNA), mRNA and ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) are subject to degradation and immune clearance in vivo after direct delivery and therefore require the help of delivery vectors.",
              "29 Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are not suitable for application in most diseases because of the drawbacks of a limited loading capacity, a lack of specific targeting ability and inability to integrate into the host genome.",
              "30 Nonviral vectors have been a hot topic of research in recent years, where lipid nanoparticles have been used in the clinic for the delivery of CRISPR gene drugs.",
              "31 Polymeric nanoparticles, biomimetic nanomaterials, and exosomes have also shown potential for the delivery of CRISPR systems in animal experiments.",
              "32 Further research and development are needed to apply nonviral vectors to a wide range of clinical applications.",
              "Each disease has different characteristics, and our aim is not to develop a universal delivery vehicle but to develop multiple vehicles applicable to different types of diseases.",
              "Therefore, studying the pathogenesis of diseases and the pathological characteristics of disease cells and tissues and constructing environment-responsive and ligand-recognizing nanoparticles based on these characteristics will further enrich gene-targeting drugs in diseased tissues.",
              "33 In addition, exosomes and cell membranes from immune cells or diseased organs can effectively avoid immune clearance, and the abundant membrane proteins on the surface enable gene-targeting drugs to be delivered to diseased cells.",
              "In this review, we discuss the development of CRISPR technology and summarize the various types of gene-editing tools that have been developed in recent years.",
              "Delivery systems for CRISPR systems in the body are also summarized, with a focus on developing new systems more suitable for different diseases, and finally, the review addresses a collection of problems that may arise when applying CRISPR technology to treat diseases and the corresponding strategies.",

              "(Figure was created with Adobe Illustrator) Like many great discoveries, the discovery of CRISPR technology was born out of an unexpected event.",
              "An unusual sequence identified in the 3\u2032 end structural domain of the iap gene was first reported by Nakata et al.",

              "35,36,37,38,39 In 2002, Janson et al.",
              "provided a generalized summary of the specific repeats that have been identified, naming these repeats as a family and using the acronym CRISPR for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.",
              "40 In addition, multiple CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas)-Cas1 to Cas4- have been revealed in previous studies.",
              "In 2005, researchers discovered that the spacer sequences in CRISPR are not unique to each organism.",
              "8 Mojica et al.",
              "found that most of the spacer sequences were derived from exogenous DNA, with only a small fraction unrelated to the outside world, and they found that viruses were more likely to infect cells without homologous spacer sequences.",
              "8 They conjectured that CRISPR is involved in bacterial resistance to infection by external phages and in plasmid transfer.",
              "11,41 The conjecture was confirmed 2 years later.",
              "42,43,44 When first confronted with phage or plasmid infestation, bacteria containing CRISPR sequences acquire a segment of their DNA sequence, which serves as a spacer region between special repeat sequences.",
              "CRISPR RNA (crRNA) then undergoes a series of transcription and maturation processes to produce a single crRNA containing a protospacer sequence of 20 bases that binds to the invading DNA via complementary base pairing.",
              "45,46 Recognition of the exogenous sequence by crRNA alone does not protect it from the phage;",
              "it also must be inactivated by disrupting the exogenous sequence through the cleavage activity of the Cas protein.",
              "47,48 The CRISPR/Cas family of proteins is divided into two categories based on genomic and protein structure information, and the best-known protein Cas9 is among the Class II CRISPR/Cas systems.49,50 Class I is characterized by a large Cas9 protein complex that shears the DNA strand, while Class II requires only a single shearing protein.",
              "Cas9 is characterized by the presence of two ribonuclease structural domains, a RuvC-like nuclease domain near the amino terminus and the HNH nuclease domain in the middle of the protein, both of which have the function of cleaving the DNA strand.",
              "51 Notably, protospacer sequences are not randomly acquired from exogenous sequences but are always accompanied by a guanine-enriched sequence called protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs).",
              "43 Subsequent studies have shown that PAM sequences play an important role in the acquisition of the spacer region, where Cas proteins perform cleavage.",
              "5,15,52 The functional mechanism of CRISPR/Cas9 has been gradually revealed, and natural CRISPR/Cas9 has been rapidly applied to bacterial transformation.",

              "coli that received the CRISPR gene sequence successfully resisted plasmid transformation, which was the first report that CRISPR/Cas9 functioned in a nonhost bacterium.",
              "54 This finding suggested that CRISPR/Cas systems can be used as a defense mechanism against external infection and that their hosts are not necessary for the CRISPR system to function.",
              "In 2012, Charpentier and Doudna purified Cas9 from S.",
              "thermophilus and Streptococcus pyogenes, enabling the cleavage of prokaryotic DNA in vitro.",
              "47,55 They also elucidated the mechanism by which CRISPR/Cas9 works, noting that the cleavage site of Cas9 is controlled by a seed sequence in the crRNA and requires the involvement of PAM.",
              "Additionally, by altering the nucleotide sequence of a seed sequence, the system can function as a gene silencer in a variety of situations, providing gene targeting and gene editing by changing a nucleotide seed sequence.",
              "Previous research on CRISPR/Cas9 has focused on prokaryotic cells, and CRISPR technology started to be used in medicine, agriculture, and other fields in a paper published by Zhang Feng et al.",

              "58 These studies had significant implications, both confirming that CRISPR motifs function in mammalian cells and simplifying the CRISPR gene-editing system, thereby providing more possibilities for the use of CRISPR.",
              "The DNA strand cleavage function of Cas9 was elucidated by designing a simple sgRNA segment to guide Cas9 to the target site, but many additional studies on genes have been performed to address functions other than DNA strand cleavage.",

              "The relative positions of sgRNAs and target gene promoter sequences also had a significant effect on silencing efficiency.",
              "Importantly, for the sgRNA targeting promoter sequences, gene silencing occurs regardless of whether the target is the template or nontemplate strand.",

              "Nucleic acids of CRISPR can be packaged in AAV vectors for delivery or introduced to target cells via electroporation/nucleofection or microinjection, with the latter methods averting virus-associated risks.",
              "However, microinjection can be technically challenging and is only suited for ex vivo delivery.",
              "Electroporation is also largely used for ex vivo but can be used in vivo for certain target tissues (93).",
              "However, high-voltage shock needed to permeabilize cell membranes via electroporation can be toxic and can lead to permanent permeabilization of treated cells (94).",
              "In addition to viral toxicity, AAV delivery of CRISPR components yields longevity of expression, leading to greater incidence of OTEs.",
              "Alternatively, delivery of the Cas9 protein and gRNA as RNP complexes has reduced OTEs while maintained editing efficacy, owing to its transient expression and rapid clearance in the cell (95).",
              "Once the delivery modality is selected, CRISPR/Cas9 edits can be facilitated either ex vivo where cells are genetically modified outside of the patient and reintroduced back, or in vivo with delivery of the CRISPR components directly into the patient where cells are edited (Figure 4).",
              "Both systems pose their own set of advantages and challenges.",
              "Advantages for ex vivo delivery include greater safety since patients are not exposed to the gene altering tool, technical feasibility, and tighter quality control of the edited cells.",
              "However, challenges to this method include survival and retention of in vivo function of cells outside the patient after genetic manipulation and extensive culture in vitro.",
              "Also, an adequate supply of cells is needed for efficient re-engraftment.",
              "These conditions limit this method to certain cell types that can survive and be expanded in culture, such as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) (96) and T cells (97).",
              "Delivery of CRISPR Therapy.",
              "Nucleic acids encoding CRISPR/Cas9 or its RNP complex can be packaged into delivery vehicles.",
              "Once packaged, edits can be facilitated either ex vivo or in vivo.",
              "Ex vivo editing involves extraction of target cells from the patient, cell culture, and expansion in vitro, delivery of the CRISPR components to yield the desired edits, selection, and expansion of edited cells, and finally reintroduction of therapeutic edited cells into the patient.",
              "In vivo editing can be systemically delivered via intravenous infusions to the patient, where the CRISPR cargo travels through the bloodstream via arteries leading to the target tissue, or locally delivered with injections directly to target tissue.",
              "Once delivered, the edits are facilitated in vivo to provide therapeutic benefit.",
              "While ex vivo gene therapy has provided therapeutic benefit for hematological disorders and cancer immunotherapy, many tissue types are not suited for this method, severely limiting its therapeutic utility for other genetic diseases.",
              "in vivo manipulation is thus needed to expand CRISPR's utility to treat a broader range of genetic diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (98) and hereditary tyrosinemia (99).",
              "CRISPR components can be delivered in vivo systemically through intravenous injections or can be locally injected to specific tissues (Figure 4).",
              "With systemic delivery, the CRISPR components and its vehicle are introduced into the circulatory system where expression of the gene editing toolkit can be controlled to target specific organs via tissue-specific promoters (100).",
              "However, challenges of in vivo delivery include degradation by circulating proteases or nucleases, opsonization by opsonins, or clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS).",
              "Furthermore, the cargo must reach the target tissue and bypass the vascular endothelium, which are often tightly connected by cell-cell junctions (101), preventing accessibility to larger delivery vehicles (>1 nm diameter).",
              "Additionally, once the cargo has reached the target cells, they must be internalized, which is generally facilitated through endocytosis where they can be transported and degraded by lysosomal enzymes (102).",
              "In addition, localization of the editing machinery near the point of injection can result in uneven distribution of the edited cell repertoire within the tissue, which may result in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes (102).",
              "While advancements are continuing to refine delivery techniques, the current systems have allowed CRISPR gene therapy to be used in the clinic.",
              "The first CRISPR Phase 1 clinical trial in the US opened in 2018 with the intent to use CRISPR/Cas9 to edit autologous T cells for cancer immunotherapy against several cancers with relapsed tumors and no further curative treatment options.",
              "These include multiple myeloma, melanoma, synovial sarcoma and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma.",
              "This trial was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after careful consideration of the risk to benefit ratios of this first application of CRISPR gene therapy into the clinic.",
              "During this trial, T lymphocytes were collected from the patients' blood and ex vivo engineered with CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains of the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR), which recognizes a specific antigen to mediate an immune response, and the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) protein, which attenuates immune response.",
              "The cells were then transduced with lentivirus to deliver a gene encoding a TCR specific for a NY-ESO-1 antigen, which has been shown to be highly upregulated in the relapsed tumors and thus can serve as a therapeutic target.",
              "Since then, many trials have opened for CRISPR-mediated cancer immunotherapy and is currently the most employed strategy for CRISPR gene therapy (Table 2).",
              "A trial implementing this strategy using other tools had already been conducted in both pre-clinical and clinical settings, but this was the first time CRISPR/Cas9 was used to generate the genetically modified T cells (97).",
              "The moderate transition of switching only the tool used for an already approved therapeutic strategy may have been key to paving the road for using CRISPR's novel abilities for gene manipulation, such as targeted gene disruption.",
              "Biological intervention of CRISPR gene therapy in clinical trials.",
              "The first clinical trial in the US using CRISPR to catalyze gene disruption for therapeutic benefit were for patients with sickle-cell anemia (SCD) and later \u03b2-thalassemia, by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics.",
              "This therapy, named CTX001, increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels, which can occupy one or two of four hemoglobin binding pockets on erythrocytes and thereby provides clinical benefit for major \u03b2-hemoglobin diseases such as SCD and \u03b2-thalassemia (103).",
              "The trial involved collecting autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from peripheral blood and using CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt the intronic erythroid-specific enhancer for the BCL11A gene (NCT03745287) as disruption of this gene increases HbF expression (104\u2013106).",
              "Genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells with BCL11A disruption are delivered by IV infusion after myeloablative conditioning with busulfan to destroy unedited hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.",

              "Results from the clinical trial that has opened for this therapy (NCT04208529) to assess the long-term risks and benefits of CTX001 will dictate whether this approach can provide a novel therapeutic opportunity for a disease that otherwise has limited treatment options.",

              "The therapy uses an AAV5 vector to deliver nucleic acid instructions for Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 and two guides targeting the ends of the CEP290 locus containing the IVS26 mutation.",
              "The DSB induced by Cas9 and both guides result in either a deletion or inversion of the IVS26 intronic region, thus preventing the aberrant splicing caused by the genetic mutation and enabling subsequent translation of the functional protein (107).",
              "Potential immunotoxicity or OTEs arising from nucleic acid viral delivery will have to be closely monitored.",
              "Nonetheless, a possibly curative medicine for genetic blindness using an in vivo approach marks an important advancement for CRISPR gene therapy.",
              "While somatic editing for CRISPR therapy has been permitted after careful consideration, human germline editing for therapeutic intent remains highly controversial.",
              "With somatic edition, any potential risk would be contained within the individual after informed consent to partake in the therapy.",
              "Embryonic editing not only removes autonomy in the decision-making process of the later born individuals, but also allows unforeseen and permanent side effects to pass down through generations.",
              "This very power warrants proceeding with caution to prevent major setbacks as witnessed by traditional gene therapy.",
              "However, a controversial CRISPR trial in human embryos led by Jiankui He may have already breached the ethical standards set in place for such trials.",
              "This pilot study involved genetic engineering of the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) gene in human embryos, with the intention of conferring HIV-resistance, as seen by a naturally occurring CCR5\u039432 mutation in a few individuals (108).",
              "However, based on the limited evidence, CRISPR/Cas9 was likely used to target this gene, but rather than replicate the naturally observed and beneficial 32-base deletion, the edits merely induced DSBs at one end of the deletion, allowing NHEJ to repair the damaged DNA while introducing random, uncharacterized mutations.",
              "Thus, it is unknown whether the resultant protein will function similarly to the naturally occurring CCR5\u039432 protein and confer HIV resistance.",
              "In addition, only one of the two embryos, termed with the pseudonym Nana, had successful edits in both copies of the CCR5 gene, whereas the other embryo, with pseudonym Lulu, had successful editing in only one copy.",
              "Despite these findings, both embryos were implanted back into their mother, knowing that the HIV-resistance will be questionable in Nana and non-existent in Lulu (109, 110).",
              "Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the mechanism for infection of some variants of the highly mutable HIV virus may heavily rely on the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) co-receptor (108, 111).",
              "With no attempts at editing CXCR4, this adds yet another layer of skepticism toward achieving HIV resistance by this strategy.",
              "In addition, OTEs, particularly over the lifetime of an individual, remain a major concern for applying this technology in humans.",
              "The recent advances in the editing tool to limit OTEs, such as using high fidelity Cas9 variants, has not been exploited.",
              "Furthermore, the rationale for selecting HIV prevention for the first use of CRISPR in implanted human embryos contributes to the poor risk to benefit ratio of this study, considering HIV patients can live long, healthy lives on a drug regimen.",
              "A more appropriate first attempt would have been to employ this technology for a more severe disease.",
              "For example, correction of the MYBPC3 gene is arguably a better target for embryonic gene editing, as mutations in MYBPC3 can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a heart condition responsible for most sudden cardiac deaths in people under the age of 30.",
              "Gene correction for this pathological mutation was achieved recently for the first time in the US in viable human embryos using the HDR-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system.",
              "However, these embryos were edited for basic research purposes and not intended for implantation.",
              "In this study, sperm carrying the pathogenic MYBPC3 mutation and the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery as an RNP complex were microinjected into healthy donor oocytes arrested at MII, achieving 72.",
              "4% homozygous wildtype embryos as opposed to 47.",
              "4% in untreated embryos.",
              "The HDR-mediated gene correction was observed at considerably high frequencies with no detectable OTEs in selected blastomeres, likely owing to the direct microinjection delivery of the RNP complex in the early zygote.",
              "Interestingly, the maternal wildtype DNA was used preferentially for templated repair over the provided exogenous ssODN template (112).",
              "While evidence for gene correction was promising, NHEJ mediated DNA repair was still observed in many embryos, highlighting the need to improve HDR efficiency before clinical application can be considered.",
              "Although strategies have been developed to improve HDR, such as chemical inhibitors of NHEJ (77\u201379), such techniques may have varying outcomes in embryonic cells and side effects that may arise from treatment needs to be investigated.",
              "Germline gene editing will remain to be ethically unfavorable at its current state and its discussions may not be considered until sufficient long-term studies of the ongoing somatic CRISPR therapy clinical trials are evaluated.",

              "However, this assay has a roughly ~30% false negative rate (116, 117) with the turnaround time of several hours to >24 h.",
              "Serological testing methods are much more rapid but lack the ability to detect acute respiratory infection since antibodies used to detect infection can take several days or weeks to develop.",
              "Recently, a CRISPR Cas12-based assay named SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR has been developed for detection of COVID-19 with a short turnaround time of about 40 min and a 95% reported accuracy.",
              "The assay involves RNA extraction followed by reverse transcription and simultaneous isothermal amplification using the RT-LAMP method.",
              "Cas12 and a guide RNA against regions of the N (nucleoprotein) gene and E (envelope) gene of SARS-CoV-2 are then targeted, which can be visualized by cleavage of a fluorescent reporter molecule.",
              "The assay also includes a laminar flow strip for a visual readout, where a single band close to where the sample was applied indicates a negative test and 2 higher bands or a single higher band would indicate cleavage of the fluorescent probe and hence positive for SARS-CoV-2 (118).",
              "In addition to CRISPR's diagnostic utility, CRISPR may provide therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients.",
              "The recently discovered Cas13 is an RNA-guided RNA-targeting endonuclease may serve as a potential therapeutic tool against COVID-19.",
              "PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells) has been developed, which utilizes the Ruminococcus flavefaciens derived VI-D CRISPR-Cas13d variant, selected for its small size facilitating easier packaging in viral vehicles, high specificity, and strong catalytic activity in human cells.",
              "This technique was developed to simultaneously target multiple regions for RNA degradation, opening the door for a much-needed pan-coronavirus targeting strategy, given the evidence suggesting relatively high mutation and recombination rates of SARS-CoV-2 (119).",
              "With these advances, the CRISPR/Cas machinery may again be implemented to serve its original purpose as a virus-battling system to provide aid during this pandemic.",

              "Gene therapy enjoyed an initial phase of excitement, until the recognition of immediate and delayed adverse effects resulted in death and caused a major setback.",
              "More recently, the discovery and development of CRISPR/Cas9 has re-opened a door for gene therapy and changed the way scientists can approach a genetic aberration\u2014by fixing a non-functional gene rather than replacing it entirely, or by disrupting an aberrant pathogenic gene.",
              "CRISPR/Cas9 provides extensive opportunities for programmable gene editing and can become a powerful asset for modern medicine.",
              "However, lessons learned from traditional gene therapy should prompt greater caution in moving forward with CRISPR systems to avoid adverse events and setbacks to the development of what may be a unique clinically beneficial technology.",
              "A failure to take these lessons into account may provoke further backlash against CRISPR/Cas9 development and slow down progression toward attaining potentially curative gene editing technologies.",
              "Although CRISPR editing in humans remains a highly debated and controversial topic, a few Regulatory Affairs Certification (RAC)-reviewed and FDA-approved CRISPR gene therapy trials have opened after thorough consideration of the risk to benefit ratios.",
              "These first few approved trials, currently in Phase I/II, are only for patients with severe diseases, such as cancers or debilitating monogenic diseases.",

              "Less bradykinin means less inflammation and swelling.",
              "The treatment is delivered in a single dose by IV.",
              "As in the hATTR treatment, the aim isn\u2019t to fix a gene, but to break a gene to stop the disease process.",
              "The CRISPR components cut the TTR gene, creating a double-stranded break in the DNA.",
              "As the cell tries to repair the DNA without a corrected template, the repair attempts mutate the gene even more.",
              "And when a gene is too badly damaged, a cell will sometimes stop making the protein it codes for.",
              "The protein prekallikrein is processed into kallikrein, which is crucial to making bradykinin.",
              "In this treatment, the aim is to make the gene that codes for prekallikrein nonfunctional (knock-out), reducing the amount of kallikrein, and ultimately reducing the amount of bradykinin.",
              "CRISPR-Cas9 is used to make a cut in the prekallikrein gene and when the body tries to repair the DNA break, it renders the gene nonfunctional.",
              "If this works as intended, it will reduce the amount of bradykinin, bringing it back into balance with C1 inhibitor protein to prevent inflammation attacks.",
              "Previous research shows how much kallikrein needs to be reduced to prevent attacks.",
              "In Intellia\u2019s work in nonhuman primate models, a single dose of the CRISPR-based treatment can reduce kallikrein protein to this level, and the reduction was sustained for more than a year.",
              "In this trial, the CRISPR-Cas9 reagents are delivered by lipid nanoparticles.",
              "As in hATTR, the aim is to edit cells in the liver.",
              "Lipid nanoparticles have a natural tendency to accumulate in the liver, so researchers are taking advantage of this to get the treatment to where it should be.",

              "This phase 1/2 study is being sponsored by Intellia Therapeutics, enrolling up to 55 patient volunteers in New Zealand.",
              "The first phase will test two different doses of the treatment, looking at safety and side effects.",
              "The second phase will compare the efficacy of the treatment relative to placebo.",
              "This trial uses the same design as Intellia\u2019s trial for hATTR: CRISPR-Cas components packaged in lipid nanoparticles, administered by IV.",
              "The lipid nanoparticles accumulate in the liver, which is where researchers are hoping editing will occur.",
              "This is an example of a platform technology: using the same components, delivery, and administration method for a treatment, while just changing onecomponent to adapt the therapy to a different disease.",
              "For CRISPR-based treatments, the variable component is typically the guide RNA that determines where a DNA cut will be made.",
              "The early success of Intellia\u2019s hATTR treatment at reducing the target protein is a positive indicator for the lipid nanoparticle/IV administration platform for liver editing.",
              "An advantage of both the hATTR trial and this trial (HAE) is that each has a helpful biomarker that can be measured.",
              "A biomarker is a molecule in the blood, urine, or other body fluid that can be measured as a diagnostic to assess how well a treatment is working.",
              "For HAE, researchers will use blood testing to see if the genome-editing components are successfully reducing the levels of proteins that cause inflammation.",
              "This is a real advantage over trials like the LCA10 trial where researchers have no direct way to assess if the successful genome editing is occurring in a living subject.",
              "In the HAE study, researchers will also track the number of inflammation attacks after treatment.",
              "CRISPR genome editing is only 10 years old, but we are already seeing remarkable progress.",
              "Each year, this article gets longer as more trials launch and therapies expand into new disease areas.",
              "Taken together, these CRISPR clinical trials are helping scientists learn about the types of DNA changes CRISPR enzymes make in different cells, (including unwanted off-target changes and problematic on-target changes), the way the immune system reacts to CRISPR-Cas tools, and how well different delivery and administration methods work.",
              "Over the past couple of years, there has been encouraging news: Victoria Gray, Jimi Olaghere, and others seem to be functionally cured of sickle cell disease or beta thalassemia, and the edited cells have taken up residence in the bone marrow, indicating the potential for a long-lasting cure.",
              "Trials for cancer immunotherapies are at early stages, but the safety and tolerability of the treatments looks promising for moving forward with more newer versions of editing technology, off-the-shelf products, for moving towards new cancer targets, and even developing new cell types for immunotherapy.",
              "The initial safety results for treating LCA10 and chronic UTI are positive and we hope to get more efficacy data over the next year.",
              "The preliminary results from the hATTR trial are particularly encouraging for this disease and a wide range of diseases with liver pathology, including the new HAE trial.",
              "New trials started this year also widen the scope of CRISPR applications to include more common diseases: HIV/AIDS and type 1 diabetes.",
              "All of the treatments are relatively new.",
              "Positive results still require long-term follow-up to see if the treatment remains effective, whether patients suffer ill effects from unwanted edits, and whether there are immune reactions in patients with virally delivered Cas proteins.",
              "While the current CRISPR clinical trials are exciting, they focus on the basic capabilities of CRISPR-Cas enzymes and offer only a glimpse of their therapeutic potential.",

              "In the world of developing new medical therapies, 10 years is not a long time, but CRISPR-based therapies have made remarkable strides.",
              "IGI\u2019s Director of Technology and Translation, Fyodor Urnov, is excited about three big shifts in CRISPR-based medicines over the past year.",
              "The first is Intellia\u2019s move from one liver-targeted therapy to another, changing only the guide RNA that dictates where in the genome the DNA edit will be made.",
              "\u201cIn Jennifer and Emmanuelle\u2019s 2012 paper, they said CRISPR is reprogrammable using simple rules,\u201d says Urnov.",
              "\u201cWith Intellia this past year, we got the first formal evidence that this is true in the clinic.",
              "First they went after hATTR amyloidosis.",
              "And then they went after angioedema, using the same lipid nanoparticle, the same Cas9 mRNA, the same method of delivering the treatment with a single-dose IV infusion.",
              "They changed 20 nucleotides of the guideRNA and they got a medicine for a different disease.",
              "This is proving that CRISPR can be used as a therapeutic platform technology in the clinic.",
              "\u201d The second exciting shift is likely to come later this year.",
              "It is anticipated that Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics\u2019s collaboration on the CRISPR-based sickle cell disease treatment given to Victoria Gray and other trial participants in the US and Europe will be approved this year, likely first in Europe.",
              "This will be the first approval of a CRISPR-based therapy for use in humans and is a landmark moment in realizing the potential of CRISPR to improve human health.",
              "\u201cThis is not only the year where we\u2019ve learned that CRISPR is a platform technology thanks to Intellia,\u201d says Urnov, \u201cBut we\u2019re also learning that this platform can be an approved medicine.",
              "\u201d The third shift is the growth of what Urnov calls \u201cthe clinical CRISPR ecosystem,\u201d that is, the variety of different types of CRISPR-based genome editing that are being used in research and in patients.",
              "Recently, an individual was treated with base editing \u2014 a type of CRISPR-based editing that does not cause double-strand breaks in DNA and may be safer for use in humans \u2014 for the first time.",
              "Prime editing, another technique for edits without double-strand breaks, is also being developed for the clinic.",
              "Different types of CRISPR proteins, and CRISPR-based epigenome editors that alter how much protein is made from a given gene rather than changing the DNA sequence, are also being developed towards clinical use.",
              "These new technologies will expand the range of conditions that can potentially be treated using CRISPR tools.",
              "The IGI closely tracks the development of new CRISPR-based therapies and the progress of the growing number of clinical trials.",

              "Please refer to the 2022 CRISPR clinical trials article for disease background and an overview of how the clinical trial process works.",
              "Sickle cell disease (SCD) and another genetic disorder affecting the hemoglobin in red blood cells, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TBT), were among the first targets of CRISPR-based treatments.",
              "A number of groups have open trials using CRISPR-based treatments.",
              "Many of these take the approach of inducing expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), a kind of hemoglobin usually only found in fetuses and in very young infants.",
              "If the gene for fetal hemoglobin is turned \u201con\u201d in adults, it can do the job of the healthy adult hemoglobin that individuals with SCD and beta thalassemia are missing.",
              "The first CRISPR-based trial for SCD and TBT was sponsored by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics.",
              "Their approach uses CRISPR to turn HbF back \u201con\u201d in cells.",

              "They\u2019ve shared results from over 40 individuals with TBT and over 30 with SCD: the results are dramatic and durable.",
              "42 of 44 individuals with TBT were no longer transfusion dependent following the treatment, having been followed for up to three years.",
              "All of the participants with SCD are free of the vaso-occlusive crises that characterize the illness following treatment.",
              "Even without directly repairing the mutations that cause SCD or TBT, this treatment seems to be a functional cure for SCD and TBT.",
              "Hear from Victoria Gray, a participant with SCD who has experienced a remarkable recovery since undergoing treatment.",
              "The treatment has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the FDA for both SCD and TBT, and similar statuses from European Medicines Agency.",
              "Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics have indicated they will seek approval in the US, EU, and UK this year.",
              "A phase 1/2 trial from Novartis and Intellia Therapeutics that takes the same approach should have data forthcoming, though the companies recently decided to discontinue their work on SCD.",
              "Editas Medicine is also conducting a phase 1/2 trial for individuals with severe SCD, but using a CRISPR system with a Cas12a protein rather than the more famous Cas9 protein.",
              "Their approach, like that of the two trials described above, is to create edits that turn \u201con\u201d HbF.",
              "This is the first time Cas12 has been used in a clinical trial, and it appears safe and without serious side effects in the first two trial participants.",
              "Early results for efficacy are positive as well, with neither patient experiencing vaso-occlusive crises as of December 2022, though this represents less than six months of follow-up.",

              "In November 2022, Beam Therapeutics began enrolling participants in their US-based phase 1/2 trial of a base editing therapy for severe SCD, aimed at turning on HbF with single-letter changes to DNA.",
              "Base editing changes single DNA letters, or nucleotides, without creating double-stranded breaks in DNA, reducing certain safety risks.",
              "Beam is not expected to share data until 2024.",
              "Read more: As of 2022, two groups were taking the alternative approach of directly correcting the disease-causing gene variant for SCD to the more common, healthy variant.",
              "In 2022, Graphite Bio dosed one participant in their phase 1/2 trial.",
              "Their approach combines electroporation to get the CRISPR proteins into the cell and a viral vector to get a DNA \u201ctemplate\u201d that the new gene variant can be copied off of into the cell.",
              "In early January 2023, Graphite shared that the first participant is experiencing prolonged low blood cell counts (pancytopenia) requiring ongoing blood transfusions and other treatments.",
              "Graphite reported the event to the FDA and is investigating what happened.",
              "Initially, they decided to voluntarily pause the trial, but recently announced that they are discontinuing development of their SCD treatment.",
              "A second trial, from a UC consortium including UCSF, UCLA, and the IGI, also aims to directly correct the disease-causing variant.",
              "While we don\u2019t yet know what caused the negative outcome in the Graphite trial, one key difference between Graphite\u2019s approach and the UC approach is that the UC approach does not use viral vectors.",
              "Enrollment in the UC trails has been delayed over the past year because of supply chain issues.",
              "The UC team expects to begin enrolling participants later in 2023.",

              "The FDA has approved CAR-T made with traditional gene therapy in 2017, and it\u2019s proven to be an effective approach.",
              "With CRISPR, researchers are hoping to make it even more powerful.",
              "Most CAR-T therapies are autologous: cells are taken from an individual patient, edited, multiplied, and then put back into the same patient.",
              "Though the treatment is completed with a single dose, the process is expensive, time-consuming, and few facilities can do it.",
              "Sometimes the manufacturing process just doesn\u2019t work, produces low potency cells, or individuals die of their disease while waiting for the manufacturing process to be completed.",
              "A central focus for CRISPR researchers is making allogeneic CAR-T cells.",
              "Allogeneic therapies are made from cells from a healthy donor.",
              "These cells are edited to attack cancer cells and avoid being targeted by a recipient\u2019s immune system or triggering graft-versus-host-disease, and then multiplied into huge batches which can be given to large numbers of recipients on demand.",
              "Allogeneic products reduce cost, time until treatment, and have the potential to provide consistently potent, high-quality cells.",
