    "query": "What is the most promising and innovative approach currently being explored to combat the problem of plastic pollution in our oceans, and how can individuals contribute to this effort?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Plastic pollution is one of the greatest threats to ocean health worldwide, affecting marine life, ecosystems, and human health[^2^]. According to a UN report, plastic pollution in oceans could more than double by 2030, with dire consequences for the climate, biodiversity, and economy[^3^].\n\nThere are many solutions being explored to combat this problem, ranging from individual actions to global policies. Some of the most promising and innovative approaches are:\n\n- Reducing our plastic dependency and consumption, especially of single-use plastics such as bags, bottles, straws, cups, and utensils[^1^] [^2^]. This can be done by refusing unnecessary plastics, purchasing reusable alternatives, and encouraging businesses to offer more sustainable options.\n- Supporting legislation that curbs plastic production and waste, such as bans on certain types of plastics, taxes or fees on polluting plastics, extended producer responsibility schemes, improved waste management systems, and zero vision for ocean plastic[^1^] [^3^]. This can be done by contacting policymakers, signing petitions, joining campaigns, and voting for environmental leaders.\n- Increasing mapping, surveillance, and research on the sources, scale, and fate of plastic pollution in the ocean, as well as its impacts on marine life and human health[^1^] [^3^]. This can be done by supporting scientific organizations, participating in citizen science projects, and sharing reliable information with others.\n- Stopping the flow of plastic waste into the sea by preventing littering, improving waste collection and recycling infrastructure, and promoting circular economy principles[^1^] [^3^]. This can be done by disposing of waste properly, segregating recyclable materials, composting organic waste, and choosing products with less packaging or recycled content.\n- Increasing funds for clean-up efforts that remove existing plastic pollution from the ocean and coastlines using innovative technologies or methods[^1^] [^4^] [^5^]. This can be done by donating to or volunteering for organizations that conduct clean-ups, such as Ocean Cleanup or Oceanic Society.\n\nAs you can see, there are many ways that individuals can contribute to solving the ocean's plastic problem. The most important thing is to take action today and inspire others to do the same. Together, we can make a difference for our blue planet.\ud83c\udf0e",

              "Marine plastics negatively impact the ability of myriad ecosystems to provide the basic benefits that humans both enjoy and take for granted, which range from clean water to productive aquaculture and fisheries, pest and disease control, climate regulation, heritage and recreation.",
              "According to the Pollution to Solution Assessment, marine plastics pollution reduces valuable marine ecosystem service by at least US$500 billion to US$2,500 billion each year, and that\u0092s not including other social and economic losses like tourism and shipping.",
              "The Assessment finds that the direct economic losses to coastal and maritime industries, such as fisheries and shipping, are significant.",

              "However, these losses aren\u0092t well reported, and the true costs of marine litter and plastics pollution on human, environmental, and social health are still being discovered.",
              "PLASTICS AND CLIMATE CHANGE Plastics are also a climate problem.",
              "Not everyone knows that plastic is produced from oil, a fossil fuel.",
              "The more plastic we make, the more fossil fuel required, the more we intensify the climate crisis in a continual negative feedback loop.",
              "Also, plastic products create greenhouse gas emissions across their whole lifecycle.",
              "If no action is taken, greenhouse gas emissions from the production, recycling and incineration of plastics could account for 19 per cent of the Paris Agreement's total allowable emissions in 2040 if we're on track to limit warming to 1.",
              "5 degrees Celsius.",
              "In recent years, there has been an increased urgency to protect the ocean and seas to tackle climate change.",
              "The ocean is the planet's largest carbon sink, storing as much as 90 per cent of the additional heat that carbon emissions have trapped in our atmosphere and one-third of the additional carbon dioxide generated since the industrial revolution.",
              "Absorbing large quantities of carbon has slowed the visible impacts of a warming planet \u0096 but also accelerated catastrophic effects below the water's surface \u0096 a warming, acidifying and chemically imbalanced ocean.",
              "Carbon is sequestered in every component of the ocean, especially mangroves, seagrass, corals and salt marshes.",
              "The more damage we do to our ocean and coastal areas, the harder it is for these ecosystems to both offset and remain resilient to climate change.",
              "Interestingly, a recent study on marine plastics pollution by GRID-Arendal, a UNEP partner, indicates that the four coastal ecosystems that store the most carbon and serve as natural barriers against rising seas and storms \u0096 mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes and coral reefs \u0096 are put under pressure from land-based plastic pollution as a consequence of their proximity to rivers.",
              "More than ever, marine litter surveys and research are essential to predict the consequences of pressures, design mitigation approaches, and guide adaptation.",
              "FROM PLASTIC POLLUTION TO SOLUTION Plastic pollution, biodiversity breakdown, and climate instability are the most pressing planetary crises of our time.",
              "The rapid growth of plastic production already poses threats to Earth's natural systems, on which life depends, and it's only projected to get worse.",
              "By 2040, plastic waste is expected to present an annual financial risk of US$100 billion for businesses that would need to bear the costs of waste management at expected volumes.",
              "It is estimated that in Italy alone, between 160,000 and 440,000 tons of additional waste were produced in 2020 due to intensified reliance on medical protective equipment during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
              "If just 1% of the single use masks that contribute to this figure were improperly disposed of, up to 10 million masks might enter and pollute the ocean per month.",
              "While the quantity of marine plastics that we need to tackle is so large it's hard to fathom, science tells us that most of the solutions we need already exist.",
              "Numerous regional, national, and local activities are helping reduce the flow of plastic into the ocean, such as the Regional Seas Conventions, national bans on single-use plastics, business commitments to reduce, redesign and reuse plastics, community clean-ups, curbside initiatives, and municipal bag bans.",
              "\"Breaking the Plastic Wave\", a global analysis of how to change the trajectory of plastic waste, reveals that we can reduce the amount of plastic entering the ocean by about 80 per cent in the next two decades if we utilize existing technologies and solutions.",
              "Continuing with business-as-usual is simply not an option.",
              "The \u0093Pollution to Solution\u0094 assessment explains that the scale of the problem requires urgent commitments and action at the global level, and from source to sea to achieve the necessary long-term reduction of waste produced on land.",

              "The UN Environment Programme\u2019s (UNEP\u2019s) recent report From Pollution to Solution shows there is currently between 75-199 million tons of plastic waste in the ocean, and in 2016 some 9-14 tons of waste entered the aquatic ecosystem.",

              "Here are some recommendations from UNEP and the Life Cycle Initiative\u2019s meta-analyses of life cycle assessment studies on SUPPs: Opt for reusable alternatives Bringing reusable bags when grocery shopping can save costs for businesses and consumers alike.",

              "Photo: Unsplash / Sigmund Consumers should not shoulder the entire burden of decreasing the impacts of SUPP.",
              "Guided by policymaker and retailer action, products should be designed to be both lightweight and durable to maximize reusability.",
              "Production should be sustainable, such as by using renewable energy and recycled materials.",
              "Sourcing locally and avoiding air-freight transported goods is another way to reduce the environmental impact of products over their life cycle.",

              "A new global report shows the severity of plastic flow into the ocean\u2014and the actions needed to reverse course In this Issue: For more than a decade, scientists have warned that humankind is leaving so much plastic in the natural environment that future archaeologists will be able to mark this era by the synthetic waste that was left behind\u2014in short, the Plastic Age.",
              "This is especially true in the ocean, where about 11 million metric tons of plastic are dumped each year\u2014an amount that is projected to nearly triple by 2040 without urgent, large-scale action, according to research by The Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ, a London-based sustainability consultancy.",
              "The two organizations detailed their findings in a 152-page report, released in July and titled \u201cBreaking the Plastic Wave,\u201d and a peer-reviewed study in the journal Science that was published online July 23 and in print Sept.",
              "18 (and that also included data on plastic pollution on land).",
              "Plastic in the ocean comes in myriad familiar forms, from shopping bags and takeout food containers to water bottles, toothbrushes, toys, bubble wrap, household appliances, and much more, the report noted.",
              "Plastic has been found along virtually every coastline on the planet and throughout the seas, including its deepest and most remote regions.",
              "According to the report, if current production, distribution, consumption, and disposal continue at their current pace, 29 million metric tons of plastic would enter the ocean annually by 2040, the equivalent of dumping 110 pounds (50 kilograms) of plastic on every meter of coastline around the world.",
              "But there\u2019s still time to reverse this trend and, encouragingly, the technology and methodologies to do so already exist.",
              "Using first-of-its-kind modeling, Pew and SYSTEMIQ looked at six scenarios to reduce plastics, ranging from worst case\u2014what the report labels \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d\u2014to a best-case \u201csystem change\u201d that would demand a significant revamping of plastics design, production, sale, use, disposal, and recycling.",
              "The research found that the system change scenario would reduce the annual flow of plastic waste into the ocean by about 80% by 2040, with action by government and industry leaders driving much of the change.",
              "\u201cThe scale of this challenge is daunting,\u201d says Winnie Lau, senior manager of Pew\u2019s ocean plastics program and lead author on the Science study.",
              "\u201cUnless we act, by 2040 the amount of plastic going into the ocean would triple annually, and the amount in the ocean would nearly quadruple.",
              "That\u2019s unimaginable and unsustainable.",
              "\u201d Lau adds that governments and businesses already have the tools and resources they need, noting that \u201cwe don\u2019t have to wait for any new invention or new technology to put a big dent in the problem.",
              "\u201d But, she says, \u201cthe work must start now.",
              "Waiting even five years would allow an additional 80 million metric tons of plastic to enter the ocean.",
              "\u201d The report reflects more than two years of work by the Pew ocean plastics initiative.",
              "Plastic, which is made largely from oil, was invented in the 19th century but didn\u2019t go into widespread use until the mid-20th century.",
              "Production soared from 2 million metric tons in 1950 to 348 million metric tons in 2017\u2014an amount that would double by 2040 under the business-as-usual scenario.",

              "View on YouTube As plastic has proliferated, so too has the science showing some of the human health impacts throughout the plastic life cycle, from the effects of raw material extraction and production on neighboring communities to the chemicals in food packaging and the deleterious impacts of mismanaged waste.",
              "Around the world, plastic waste has blocked rivers and drainage systems, causing flooding and trapping stagnant water that exacerbates the spread of disease.",
              "Open burning of plastic waste pollutes air and water, emitting toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases;",
              "in 2016, such burning released an estimated 1 gigaton of equivalent carbon dioxide, a figure that\u2019s expected to more than double\u2014to 2.",
              "1 gigatons\u2014under the business-as-usual scenario, according to the Pew-SYSTEMIQ report.",
              "And in the past 20 years, numerous studies have found plastic compounds in much of the seafood that people eat, adding another potential layer of negative health consequences to the equation.",
              "95% of plastic packaging is used in one-and-done products.",
              "One major issue in solving the problem is that plastic is virtually indestructible.",
              "Pew\u2019s Lau points out that \u201cthere are practically no natural processes that can degrade plastic back into the ecosystem.",
              "Some people say plastic might break down after a few hundred years\u2014but we don\u2019t know, because we haven\u2019t lived with plastic that long.",
              "It will stay with us, maybe forever.",
              "\u201d Another huge part of the problem is that 95% of plastic packaging is used in one-and-done products, including items such as condiment packets, food wrapping, and bubble wrap, which means that their life cycle is linear: They\u2019re produced, sold, used, and discarded with little chance of being recycled.",
              "The ultimate goal, Pew and SYSTEMIQ say, is a circular plastics economy, one in which the need for new plastic production and the waste disposal of existing plastic decline significantly.",
              "Those changes would require dramatic drops in production and use of plastics, as well as substantial increases in reuse and recycling.",
              "Today, although 71% of the plastic produced is formally collected after use\u2014a figure that doesn\u2019t include what\u2019s gathered by informal waste pickers around the world\u2014less than 15% is actually recycled.",
              "This gap is due, in large part, to two factors: the higher cost of recycled versus raw plastic, and the fact that problematic plastic such as sachets, thin bags, and films cannot be economically recycled.",
              "To make a dent in the problem, companies need to make far less plastic than they do today, and recycling needs to ramp up significantly, although neither of those solutions on its own, the report says, would suffice: Improved recycling could reduce the flow of plastic into the seas by 20%, while reducing the production of plastic would yield a 30% drop, numbers that even when combined aren\u2019t enough to stave off severe environmental consequences.",
              "Breaking the plastic wave, Pew and SYSTEMIQ say in the report, requires \u201cimmediate, ambitious, and concerted actions.",
              "\u201d The report calls for eight interventions: During an online launch event for the report, Martin Stuchtey, founder and managing director of SYSTEMIQ, said that the current global predicament shows \u201chow we have departed from the fundamental design principles of nature.",
              "\u201d Prior to the deep research that underpins the report, Stuchtey says, many of the propositions for addressing ocean plastic pollution were very often \u201cunreconciled, untested, and not substantiated.",
              "\u201d But, he noted, the report showed a credible pathway to stemming the flood of plastic pollution in the ocean.",
              "In addition to the environmental argument, financial incentives exist for making systemic change, the report says.",
              "Governments would spend an estimated $670 billion over the next two decades managing plastic waste and recycling under the business-as-usual scenario, a figure that could drop to $600 billion if all of the solutions recommended in the report are implemented.",
              "Likewise, industry\u2019s costs would drop from $10 trillion to $8.",
              "7 trillion over that span, and about 1 million new jobs would be created, including in recycling and in the development and manufacturing of alternative materials.",
              "In addition, greenhouse gas emissions tied to plastic production, recycling, and open burning would be 25% less under the system change scenario than under the business-as-usual scenario.",
              "The report weighed various factors\u2014affordability, costs, performance, technology, convenience, and feasibility\u2014in evaluating available solutions among the eight interventions.",
              "The greatest economic return came from reducing plastic production and use, followed by recycling.",
              "Disposal, Stuchtey notes, will always cost governments money, although that cost would be lower if there were less waste to manage.",
              "And substituting compostable and paper material for plastic will cost industry money in the near term but reduce the long-term business risks associated with the high cost of waste management.",
              "Some governments have made manufacturers responsible for the costs of plastic processing and disposal.",
              "Although, as the report points out, the technology already exists to implement the needed interventions, the report adds that to be successful, governments and industry need new regulatory frameworks, business models, and funding mechanisms. With those in place, projected plastic waste generation could be reduced by nearly one-third through elimination, reuse, and new delivery models, such as refillable containers and product subscription services that collect and reuse containers, and by another 17% by substituting plastic with paper and compostable materials.",
              "Designing products and packaging for recycling\u2014instead of for single use\u2014would expand the share of economically recyclable plastic from an estimated 21% to 54%.",
              "The report also calls for a \u201csubstantial shift of investment away from the production of new plastic to the development of reuse and refill systems and sustainable substitute materials,\u201d something the world\u2019s major lenders may be hesitant to do unless they see a high likelihood that it will pay off.",
              "And the document offers some detailed guidance for countries in different economic strata.",
              "\u201cBreaking the plastic wave will require every nation to do its part, but in different ways,\u201d the report says.",
              "\u201cMiddle- and low-income countries should focus on expanding collection of plastic waste, maximizing reduction and substitution, investing in sorting and recycling infrastructure, and reducing leakage from waste sites.",
              "High-income countries should incentivize reductions in plastic usage, boost recycling rates, end exports of plastic waste, and address microplastic leakage.",
              "\u201d Although communities around the world have already begun banning plastic shopping bags, and restaurants are forgoing plastic straws, these efforts aren\u2019t enough, the report says.",
              "Even if all governments and companies follow through on their current commitments to reduce plastic use and waste, the annual volume of plastic flowing into the ocean would drop only about 7% by 2040.",
              "One reason is that most new regulations\u2014such as the European Union\u2019s 2019 directive to reduce single-use plastics\u2014focus on specific products, such as bags or straws, rather than on systemic change, and do not significantly curb the projected growth in plastic production.",
              "Industry has also made high-profile commitments to fight plastic pollution\u2014Nestle, for example, has vowed to make 100% of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025\u2014but even if fully implemented, these steps will address only a tiny fraction of the problem.",
              "Systemic change, in contrast to relying on product-specific regulations, would require middle- and low-income countries to expand their waste collection rates to 90% in urban areas and 50% in rural areas and to support the informal collection sector.",
              "Achieving that goal would require adding 4 billion people to the world\u2019s waste and recycling collection ranks, or 500,000 people per day, every day from now to 2040.",
              "And globally, mechanical recycling capacity would need to double to 86 million metric tons per year.",
              "Pew\u2019s Lau says both of these targets are ambitious but reachable with existing technology.",
              "Beyond the use of existing technology, industry is also seeking to develop new technology to perform a type of recycling called chemical plastic-to-plastic conversion\u2014which makes new products from plastic that, due to its composition, cannot be economically recycled by other means.",
              "Under full system change, this technology, using clean energy, could reach a global capacity of up to 13 million metric tons per year\u2014only 6% of global plastic waste\u2014by 2040.",
              "And to slow ocean plastic pollution until that capacity is reached, industry would need to build facilities to dispose of the 23% of plastic that cannot be recycled economically with existing technology.",
              "Also, governments would need to reduce by 90% plastic waste exports to countries with low collection and high leakage rates\u2014a significant demand on a system under which more than 15 million metric tons of plastic waste were exported globally in 2016, the latest year for which reliable data are available.",
              "Lastly, the report calls for tackling a particularly vexing component of ocean pollution: microplastics, or particles less than 5 millimeters in size.",
              "Microplastics now account for 11% of the 11 million metric tons of plastic entering the ocean annually, and the report says that applying new technology to the design and production of four major sources of microplastic\u2014tires, textiles, personal care products, and production pellets, which are the small beads that companies melt and mold into their products\u2014would reduce microplastic leakage to the ocean by 1.",
              "8 million metric tons per year (from 3 million metric tons to 1.",
              "2 million metric tons) by 2040.",
              "Pew and SYSTEMIQ see the report as a blueprint for substantially reducing ocean plastic pollution.",
              "\u201cThis was an essential first step to quantify the problem and identify solutions,\u201d says Richard Bailey, the University of Oxford professor of environmental systems who designed the scenario models and the software that simulated the flow of seven types of plastics over one 25-year period with numerous variables\u2014a process that eventually yielded 5.",
              "2 million years\u2019 worth of simulations.",
              "\u201cAn important next step is to see how these solutions can be implemented on a small scale, in individual cities and countries.",
              "\u201d Alan Jope, CEO of Unilever, who also spoke at the virtual launch event in July, said the report could prove to be the defining strategic baseline for tackling ocean plastic pollution.",
              "He decried \u201cour throwaway business models and throwaway culture,\u201d and said Unilever, a manufacturer of many consumer products, has committed to halve its use of virgin (raw, nonrecycled) plastic by 2025, and to collect and recycle more plastic from the environment than the plastic packaging that the company sells.",
              "As for Pew, the next steps involve seeking government, businesses, and civil society signatories to a joint statement on preventing ocean plastic pollution;",
              "working to make the report findings more accessible to policymakers;",
              "and determining how the Trusts can best position itself to help solve this problem.",
              "As difficult as the problem is, the reward for success is enormous: \u201cIt will mean less plastic going into the ocean, less being burned, better air quality, less greenhouse gas emissions, and improved human well-being and health,\u201d Lau says.",
              "\u201cAlso, governments save billions of dollars, and businesses and investors have new opportunities for innovation.",
              "And isn\u2019t that the kind of future we all want, for ourselves, our children, and our ocean?",

              "Because microplastics have been found in all marine life\u2014even in the guts of tiny crustaceans in the ocean\u2019s deepest trenches\u2014they are part of the food chain and are also consumed by humans.",
              "Microplastics have already been found in human blood, feces, and in the placentas of unborn babies, but so far there have been no large definitive studies on how microplastics harm human health.",

              "Yan is also working with Riverkeeper, Philip Orton from Stevens Institute of Technology, and his colleague Joaquim Goes at Lamont to study the sources and environmental fate of microplastics in NYC waterways.",
              "Cleaning up microplastics while also protecting ecosystems will not be easy.",
              "Yan said, \u201cThose tiny microplastics coexist with many other minerals and fine particles, like silt, clay, plant debris, and black carbon\u2014all sorts of other particles, whether natural or anthropogenic.",
              "They have a similar size and density, so it\u2019s difficult to efficiently separate microplastics from other particles.",

              "Wasser 3.",
              "0, a German company, uses a special non-toxic compound which, when circulated in a vortex, pulls microplastics into popcorn-like clumps that can then be collected.",
              "The technique could be used in sewage treatment plants or industrial processes.",
              "It is already being used in a paper processing plant and a wastewater treatment plant in Landau-Mo\u0308rlheim where it has removed 600 pounds of microplastics.",

              "And a chemistry student in the Netherlands invented a device where microplastics attach themselves to a magnetic liquid;",
              "the contents can then be removed with a magnet, leaving only water behind.",
              "Yan contends that the most cost-effective way to deal with plastic pollution, however, is to control its sources.",
              "For example, sewage is one of the primary sources of microplastics, though microplastics originate from the products people use.",
              "Studies show that most of the microplastics in sewage effluent are microfibers that come from laundry\u2014washing machines and driers.",
              "Yan\u2019s study of New York City waters found that more than 90 percent of the microplastics greater than 0.",
              "2 millimeters were microfibers shed from clothing, transported by the wastewater of washing machines.",
              "With more and more people dressing in clothes made from synthetics that shed microfibers, it\u2019s unlikely that the fashion business will stop using these materials, so microfibers must somehow be prevented from getting into the sewage system to begin with.",
              "Yan and researchers from SUNY Stony Brook and North Carolina State University are proposing a study to NOAA to develop advanced filtration techniques that can capture microplastics and fibers from the laundry and repurpose them into new fibers for use in the fashion industry.",
              "In addition to the microplastics accumulating in sediments, larger plastic also sinks to the seafloor.",
              "One study found that 50 percent of the plastic in landfills is denser than seawater, which means these objects may sink on their own.",
              "The other 50 percent can be colonized by barnacles and other organisms over time, making them heavier than seawater, so eventually they sink as well.",

              "According to Yan, the two fundamental questions about plastics on the ocean floor are: where are the macroplastics, and are they causing trouble?",
              "\u201cThe scientific community can use models to figure out where most of these plastics are, because we don\u2019t know right now,\u201d he said.",
              "But cleaning up the plastics on the ocean floor is challenging because they settle so deep, and a cleanup would be very costly.",
              "Another concern is that plastics on the ocean bottom become part of the ecosystem.",
              "\u201cSome of the animals use the plastics and live with them,\u201d Yan said.",

              "\u201d Yan believes that scientists may eventually develop an underwater drone that can identify macroplastics and gather them from the ocean bottom.",
              "However, this would be expensive because of the need to lower the drones, pick up the macroplastics and bring them to shore, and possibly the need for trained pilots to operate the drones.",
              "While cleanup technologies have a role to play in cleaning up ocean plastic, no single solution can effectively reduce ocean plastic.",
              "What is required is fundamental and systemic change that includes the banning of single-use plastics in favor of products designed to be recycled or repaired, and more recycling infrastructure.",
              "Breaking the Plastic Wave, a Pew Report, identified the measures which, if implemented, could cut annual dumping of plastic into the ocean by 80 percent in 20 years.",

              "Pathetically, less than 10 percent of plastics are recycled right now.",
