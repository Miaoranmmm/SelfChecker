    "query": "What is the most effective way to promote and maintain healthy sleep habits, and how do different factors such as age, lifestyle, and genetics impact our sleep patterns and quality?",
    "response": "That's a great question. There are many factors that can affect our sleep patterns and quality, such as age, lifestyle, and genetics. However, there are also some general tips that can help promote and maintain healthy sleep habits for most people. According to the Mayo Clinic[^1^] and the CDC[^2^], some of these tips are:\n\n- Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, including weekends. This helps reinforce your body's natural sleep-wake cycle and makes it easier to fall asleep at night.\n- Pay attention to what you eat and drink. Avoid large meals, caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine before bedtime, as they can interfere with your sleep quality or make it harder to fall asleep. Also, don't go to bed hungry or thirsty, as this can cause discomfort or wakefulness during the night.\n- Create a restful environment. Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing, and at a comfortable temperature. Remove any sources of noise, light, or distraction, such as TVs, computers, smartphones, or clocks. You can also use curtains, blinds, earplugs, fans, or white noise machines to create a more conducive setting for sleep.\n- Get some exercise. Being physically active during the day can help you fall asleep more easily at night and improve your sleep quality. However, avoid exercising too close to bedtime, as this can make you too alert or energized to sleep.\n- Avoid naps if possible. Napping during the day can disrupt your sleep cycle and make it harder to fall asleep at night. If you do need a nap, limit it to about 20 minutes and avoid napping after 3 p.m.\n\nFollowing these tips can help you get a good night's sleep and enjoy the many health benefits of sleep[^3^], such as improved mood, memory, immunity, metabolism, and overall well-being.",

              "For this reason, they likely have greater flexibility in tailoring their day-to-day activities to their energy levels (as opposed to individuals working full time) and are therefore less likely to consider themselves \u2018disrupted\u2019 even in the presence of suboptimal sleep.",
              "Although more detailed, interview-based investigations would be necessary to examine the precise nature of these findings, it stands to reason that certain symptoms change not just in prevalence but also in meaning across the lifespan.",
              "One key strength of our broad phenotypic assessment is that it allows for direct comparison of the different measures of sleep quality and four key health domains.",
              "We found strongest associations between sleep quality and mental health, moderate relations between sleep quality and physical health and cognitive health and sleep, virtually all such that poorer sleep is associated with poorer health outcomes.",

              "Perhaps surprisingly, given the strong relationships in the same sample between sleep and other outcomes (eg, mental health, online supplementary figure 10), we found that self-reported sleep problems in a non-clinical sample are not associated with fractional anisotropy above and beyond old age.",
              "This is despite the fact that previous work within the same cohort observed moderate to strong associations between white matter and various cognitive outcomes.",
              "42 80 81 However, although notable, our finding does not rule out that such associations do exist with other white matter metrics, that they would be observed with objective measures of sleep such as polysomnography, or that the co-occurrence of age-related declines in sleep quality and white matter share an underlying causal association that cannot be teased apart in a cross-sectional sample.",
              "One strength of our study is the assessment of neuroimaging metrics, namely, fractional anisotropy, in a large, community-dwelling healthy population.",
              "Fractional anisotropy is often used in studies of ageing (eg, Madden is relatively reliable82) and is sensitive to clinical anomalies such as WMHs.",
              "However, the relationship between FA and white matter health is indirect40 83 and drawbacks include its inability to distinguish crossing fibres (eg, Jones et al40 and Wandell83) and vulnerability to movement and the fact that it likely reflects a combination of underlying physiological properties.",
              "Various alternative white matter metrics exist, including summary measures of diffusivity (eg, axial/radial/mean diffusivity), volumetric measures of white matter hyperintensity and various innovative measures currently in development, but their physiological validity is ongoing.",
              "83 84 While there are limitations of self-report measures including in older cohorts,19 including the fact that they likely reflect different aspects of sleep health than polysomnography (sleep in the lab), our results suggest that there are considerable advantages in using self-reported sleep measures: first, obtaining sleep quality data in a large and broadly phenotyped sample is feasible and second, our results demonstrated clear and consistent associations across multiple domains for both subjective (eg, self-reported health) and objective measures (eg, memory tests, BMI), which both replicate and extend previous lab-based sleep findings.",
              "Future work should ideally simultaneously measure polysomnography and self-report in longitudinal, large-scale cohorts to fully capture the range of overlapping and complementary relations between different aspects of sleep quality and health outcomes.",
              "19 For both self-report and objective measures of sleep quality, an open question is that of causality: does poor sleep affect health outcomes, do health problems affect sleep, are they both markers of some third problem or do causal influences go both ways?",
              "Most likely, all these patterns occur to varying degrees.",
              "Previous studies have shown that sleep quality causally affects health outcomes such as diabetes43 and memory consolidation,1 while other evidence suggests that depression directly affects sleep quality85 86 and that damage to neural structures may affect sleep regulation.",
              "87 Although our findings are in keeping with previous findings, our cross-sectional sample cannot tease apart the causal direction of the observed associations, more work remains to be done to disentangle these complex causal pathways.",
              "In our paper, we focus on a healthy, age-heterogeneous community-dwelling sample.",
              "This allows us to study the associations between healthy ageing and self-reported sleep quality, but comes with two key limitations of the interpretations of our findings.",
              "First and foremost, our findings are cross-sectional, not longitudinal.",
              "This means that we can make inferences about age-related differences, but not necessarily age-related changes.",
              "88 89 One reason why cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates may diverge is that older adults can be thought of as cohorts that differ from the younger adults in more ways than age alone.",
              "For example, our age range includes individuals born in the twenties and thirties of the 20th century.",
              "Compared with someone born in the 21st century, these individuals will likely have experience various differences during early life development (eg, less broadly accessible education, lower quality of healthcare, poorer nutrition and similar patterns).",
              "For some of our measures, these are inherent limitations\u2014truly longitudinal study of neural ageing is inherently impossible as scanner technology has not been around sufficiently long.",
              "This means our findings likely reflect a combination of effects attributable to age-related changes as well as baseline differences between subpopulations that may affect both mean differences and developmental trajectories.",
              "Second, our sample reflects an atypical population in the sense that they are willing and able to visit the laboratory on multiple occasions for testing sessions.",
              "This subsample is likely a more healthy subset of the full population, which will mean the range of (poor) sleep quality as well as (poorer) health outcomes will likely be less extreme than in the full population.",
              "However, this challenge is not specific to our sample.",
              "In fact, as the Cam-CAN cohort was developed using stratified sampling based on primary healthcare providers, our sample is likely as population representative as is feasible for a cohort of this magnitude and phenotypic breadth (see Shafto et al12 for further details).",
              "Nonetheless, a healthier subsample may lead to restriction of range,90 that is, an attenuation of the strength of the associations observed between sleep quality and health outcomes.",
              "Practically, this means that our results likely generalise to comparable, healthy community-dwelling adults, but not necessarily to populations that include those affected by either clinical sleep deprivation or other serious health conditions.",
              "Taken together, our study allows several conclusions.",
              "First, although we replicate the age-related deterioration in some aspects of sleep quality, other aspects remain stable or even improve.",
              "Second, we show that the profile of sleep quality changes across the lifespan.",
              "This is important methodologically, as it suggests that PSQI sum scores do not capture the full picture, especially in age-heterogeneous samples.",
              "Moreover, it is important from a psychological standpoint: we show that \u2018sleep quality\u2019 is a multidimensional construct and should be treated as such if we wish to understand the complex effects and consequences of sleep quality across the lifespan.",
              "Third, moderate to strong relations exist between sleep quality and cognitive, physical and mental health, and these relations largely remain stable across the lifespan.",
              "In contrast, we show evidence that in non-clinical populations, poorer self-reported sleep is not reliably associated with poorer neural health.",
              "Finally, we find that for absolute sleep duration, we replicate previous findings that both longer and shorter than average amounts of sleep are in association with poorer self-reported general health and higher levels of depression and anxiety.",
              "Together with previous experimental and longitudinal evidence, our findings suggest that at least some age-related decreases in health outcomes may be due to poorer sleep quality.",
              "We show that self-reported sleep quality can be an important indicator of other aspects of healthy functioning throughout the lifespan, especially for mental and general physical health.",
              "Our findings suggest that accurate understanding of sleep quality is essential in understanding and supporting healthy ageing across the lifespan.",

              "Such results suggest that in peripheral and especially in extra-SCN brain tissues the clock gene circuitry may be used to track time spent awake and asleep rather than circadian time, which is compatible with the notion that clock genes integrate environmental and systemic cues such as temperature, corticosterone, light, and metabolic state, a number of which change according to sleep-wake state 96, 98.",

              "The amount of sleep a person needs\u2014as well as his or her preference for waking early or staying up late\u2014varies from individual to individual.",
              "Some of these variations in sleep duration and timing, like many other characteristics, such as eye or hair color, are genetically determined.",
              "In addition to genetic influences, there are cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors that influence when and how much we sleep.",
              "For example, many people living in hot climates have an afternoon siesta to avoid activities in the mid-day sun, and consequently have shorter sleep duration at night.",
              "The amount of sleep that people obtain is also affected by medical disorders and medications.",
              "Determining exactly how much sleep a person requires usually involves having that individual live in a laboratory environment for a number of days and nights, without other commitments, and allowing them to sleep as much as they wish.",
              "Such laboratory studies have revealed that most adults, on average, need between seven and nine hours per night.",
              "However, a given individual may be outside that range: some people need as little as six hours, and others require slightly more than nine.",
              "A rough idea of how much sleep you need can be obtained by going on \"vacation\" for several days, going to sleep when you feel sleepy and waking up spontaneously.",
              "Assuming you are refreshed when you wake up, the hours you slept are your sleep need.",
              "Humans are a diurnal species, meaning that we are generally active during the day and sleep at night.",
              "Some individuals feel more awake, alert, and able to do their best work in the morning.",
              "We typically refer to these people as \"larks,\" or morning-type individuals.",
              "Others have a hard time waking up or feeling alert in the morning and feel that they are most productive in the evening or night.",
              "We refer to these people as \"owls,\" or evening-type people.",
              "What determines our desire to wake with the sun or, conversely, burn the midnight oil, is influenced by the same system that regulates the cycling of many bodily functions.",
              "Our internal biological clock resides in the brain and regulates the timing of functions such as appetite, hormone release, and metabolism.",
              "Of all the cycles controlled by the circadian system, perhaps the most obvious is the sleep-wake cycle\u2014when we go to sleep and when we wake up.",
              "Although our internal clock is set to approximately 24 hours, the exact timing of circadian rhythms varies from one person to the next.",
              "Differences in the speed of the circadian clock may help determine whether you are an \"owl' or a \"lark.\"",
              "For instance, there is some evidence that if your circadian clock runs faster than 24 hours, you may tend to be a \"lark\";",
              "if your clock runs slower than 24 hours, you tend to be an \"owl.\"",
              "Although we often use the term \"morning person\" in fun, being a morning or night person is influenced by the genetics of how fast or slow our internal clocks tick.",
              "Genes influence how fast or slow our internal clock runs and, as a result, how closely it\u2014and our body\u2019s functions\u2014align with the 24-hour day.",
              "Changes in these genes, known as mutations, from one generation to the next can affect the clock's timing.",

              "Because of their family and other social obligations, it may be difficult for these people to go to bed early enough to get sufficient sleep.",
              "And because early awakenings often occur even after late bedtimes, chronic sleep deprivation is common in people with ASPS.",
              "The opposite extreme is called delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), which is characterized by a very late bedtime and wake time.",

              "The research is complex because there are likely to be multiple genes involved.",
              "In addition, sleep apnea may be caused by varied factors in different individuals.",
              "For instance, different genes may be responsible for helping define the shape of the airways, the control of the muscles surrounding the throat, and the overall control of breathing\u2014all of which may cause or worsen sleep apnea.",
              "Furthermore, such genetic factors must be distinguished from others that might underlie conditions commonly associated with apnea, particularly obesity and hypertension.",
              "Researchers have found that some people with a slight genetic variation in one or more genes are much more vulnerable to the adverse effects of sleep loss than the average person.",
              "(Staying awake for 24 consecutive hours is one example of sleep loss.)",
              "Somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of the population have this type of condition.",
              "For example, if a person has a mutation that results in a sleep system that sends out a very strong drive to sleep, he or she may be much less likely to develop insomnia than the average person.",

              "Additionally, using the bed for activities other than sleep loaded on this factor too, which aligns with findings that suggest adult bedtime activities occur consistently and without much thought [36].",
              "This might reflect the performance of other activities in bed like reading, checking emails, or using social media in bed as being habitually performed [37] and therefore belonging to a general routine factor alongside setting a consistent sleep schedule.",
              "Other sleep hygiene behaviours which did not account for unique variance in sleep, but which were independently associated with sleep seemed to share variance in the outcome variable and were also reflected in the factor analysis by loading onto a single factor which we categorised as a physiological factor.",
              "These five sleep hygiene behaviours included going to bed hungry or thirsty, napping during the day, not getting exposure to sunlight or outdoor light during the day, and going to bed in a poorly ventilated environment.",
              "Although each of these sleep hygiene behaviours are proposed to effect sleep in distinctly different ways [38,39,40,41], they share a commonality in that they are all involved in a physiological process.",
              "For example, poor ventilation can reduce oxygen supply [38], hunger and thirst are markers that signal a survival need [42], napping is often a response to a deficiency in sleep needs [41], and sunlight helps entrain the circadian rhythm by regulating melatonin production [39].",
              "As such, the common variance in these items could represent a grouping of behaviours which contribute to sleep through biological or physiological means.",
              "Use of sleep medication was positively associated with PSQI scores which indicate that more frequent use was related to poorer sleep.",
              "This initially seems counterintuitive, since sleep medications ought to improve sleep, not impair it.",
              "However, this association has been demonstrated in previous literature [43].",
              "A potential explanation for this is that those that use sleep medication are often inherently poorer sleepers who turn to sleep medications, which may not always improve their subjective sleep quality.",
              "Furthermore, prolonged use can lead to altered sleep physiology, and built-up tolerance effects may render their ability to improve sleep minimal [44].",
              "Therefore, the observed negative association may reflect poorer sleepers turning to sleep medications, rather than a causative effect of sleep medications decreasing sleep quality.",
              "While there is much to be said about those behaviours that were significantly related to sleep, attention should also be given to those that were not.",
              "For some behaviours, the lack of association with sleep may be explainable by properties of the behaviour itself.",
              "That is, certain thresholds or conditions of performance of the behaviour may be more important to consider than whether there is an overall effect (e.",
              "g., the quantity of alcohol, or the timing of exercise before bed).",
              "To illustrate further, consider the impact of exposure to blue light on sleep as an example, a behaviour which was not significantly related to sleep in the present study.",
              "Although research has demonstrated that blue light can interrupt sleep patterns by suppressing melatonin [45], blue blocking lenses have been shown to have limited efficacy in improving sleep quality [46].",
              "Furthermore, other studies have compared blue light blocking filters on smartphones and tablets compared to unfiltered screens and found no differences in sleep outcomes and melatonin suppression (e.",
              "g., [47]).",
              "However, these studies did not test these effects at exposure times greater than two hours, and since the item in the present study did not ask participants to quantify the source of blue light nor the amount of time exposed, it is possible that effects of blue light may only significantly impact sleep under certain parameters (i.",
              "e., long exposure times).",
              "This effect has been demonstrated by Heo et al.",
              "[48] who assessed exposure at 150 min to observe a significant effect on sleepiness, and may explain the success of blue-light blocking lens during the evening at workplaces [49], where it is presumed that blue-light exposure at workplace is also greater than two hours.",
              "The subjective recall of the behaviour in the present study might also have contributed to the null finding if this effect is indeed true.",
              "A critical lens applied to the remaining non-significant behaviours might elicit other plausible explanations for each behaviour, although the required level of detail to achieve this goes beyond the scope of the present research and might be best suited in a narrative review.",
              "Instead, we reiterate that many of the behaviours which were not related to sleep may be better explained by specific characteristics of the behaviour itself (e.",
              "g., time of performance in relation to sleep, intensity of the behaviour), and deserve appropriate attention to disentangle thresholds or conditions in which they impact sleep.",
              "Although not all of these specific characteristics of behaviour were explored in the present study, the results do suggest that one such characteristic (individual perceptions) may serve as an additional factor to consider when exploring the relationship between sleep hygiene behaviours and sleep.",
              "Four perceptions (checking the time during the night, screen use before bed, waking up at different times each day, and spending different lengths of time asleep each night) were significantly associated with sleep over and above simply performing the respective behaviour.",
              "This indicates that in addition to performing a detrimental sleep hygiene behaviour, believing that this performance was impairing sleep was able to explain additional variance in some of the behaviours examined.",
              "An obvious interpretation of these findings is that having strong negative beliefs about the impact of a behaviour is simply reflective of an inherent underlying tendency to worry or ruminate which in turn is associated with poorer sleep [50].",
              "While this might be the case for some associations observed, the interaction effects demonstrated in the present study suggest that the role of perceptions may go further than this.",
              "For two behaviours (not getting enough exposure to sunlight/outdoor light and checking the time during the night) the results show that the associations of performing the behaviour with sleep were moderated by negative perceptions about the personal impact of the behaviour.",
              "For checking the time, the relationship was exaggerated by negative perceptions, and for no sunlight exposure, the relationship was only present when perceptions were negative.",
              "These findings are novel and although they were not replicated for each behaviour examined in the present population, they do suggest that the role of perceptions about sleep hygiene behaviours on sleep ought to be examined further (e.",
              "g., whether controlling negative perceptions of sleep hygiene behaviours leads to better sleep).",
              "The present research findings have public health implications through several avenues.",
              "Exploratory factor analyses importantly revealed the clustering of several behaviours that were drawn across three commonly used sleep hygiene scales.",
              "Researchers are therefore able to consider choosing one or more domains that tailor to their specific needs.",
              "For instance, schedule-type behaviours may be of particular importance for research with shift workers, whereas behaviours that fall under perseverative cognition could be applied to research in populations that are more likely to reflect this psychopathology.",
              "Furthermore, the use of distinct domains may also provide insight for GPs and clinicians into specific problematic areas and allow for a more targeted approach when developing treatment plans.",
              "Rather than treating poor sleep hygiene as an overall deficit, attempts to target a specific domain with related problematic behaviours may yield more efficacious results while reducing the demand on resources for both patient and clinician.",
              "The present exploratory examination of accepted sleep hygiene behaviours provided more support for the inclusion of some behaviours.",
              "However, one limitation of the present research was the use of subjective measures to account for sleep outcomes.",
              "Differences between subjective and objective measures have been demonstrated previously [51] and a combination of both would be useful to strengthen the certainty from which conclusions can be made.",
              "Similarly, the cross-sectional design limits the extent to which confounding variables could be accounted for.",
              "Experimental studies which manipulate the exposure to different sleep hygiene variables will be important to determine the causal impact of individual behaviours on sleep.",
              "However, the use of a cross-sectional design allowed for the unobtrusive examination of the much more realistic possibility where multiple sleep hygiene behaviours are performed each night, allowing for valuable inferences for many behaviours to be drawn simultaneously from a naturalistic setting.",
              "Future research could however look to adopt repeated measures designs that assess day-to-day fluctuations in sleep outcomes based on variations in the presence/absence of specific sleep hygiene behaviours, particularly for those behaviours which did not relate significantly to sleep.",
              "Adopting such methodologies which draw on the present findings, could progress knowledge within the field to the point where a new sleep hygiene scale could be developed.",
              "There are also some potential limitations associated with recruitment via paid online participant pools [52], the most commonly cited are the potential for limited attention and higher risk of biased responding (e.",
              "g., by demand characteristics of the researcher).",
              "However, the present study included three measures to combat such concerns including use of attention checks, recruitment of only participants with high (> 95%) approval ratings, and recruitment of only participants who had completed more than 100 studies.",
              "When implemented, such measures have been shown to produce high quality data in Prolific, and thus we considered the sample to be a relatively valid representation of a broad cross-section of the general population [53].",
              "However, given the recruitment method, the findings may not be generalisable to other more specific samples of interest (e.",
              "g., shift workers or disordered populations).",
              "In combination, the results provide several directions for future research.",
              "Firstly, additional evidence has been garnered for several sleep hygiene behaviours, which ought to serve as a basis for which behaviours to include for future sleep hygiene scale development in general populations.",
              "Concurrently, the findings also highlight many sleep hygiene behaviours which were not associated with sleep problems in the general population, flagging areas which ought to be examined more critically (e.",
              "g., by further exploring the conditions in which a behaviour is related to sleep) before being considered for inclusion in the refinement and validation of a sleep hygiene scale for non-clinical populations.",
              "Alternatively, techniques for improving sleep in non-clinical populations may benefit from focusing on a smaller number of self-selected behaviours [54], or by targeting discrete sleep hygiene factors, rather than focusing on numerous individual behaviours within existing scales.",
              "This conclusion is supported by the limited effect of non-significant behaviours demonstrated here and in other research, the practical difficulty associated with having to control many behaviours each day to enhance sleep, and the results from the factor analysis which suggest that many behaviours share an underlying mechanism anyway.",
              "Overall, the research further highlights the complexity of the relationship between sleep hygiene behaviours and sleep and draws attention to the need to assess sleep hygiene behaviours more critically.",
              "Routine-based factors such as going to bed and waking up at the same time and spending the same amount of time sleeping each night were important predictors of sleep.",
              "Behaviours that reflected perseverative cognitions (worrying about sleep during the day or at night and checking the time in the middle of the night) were also related to sleep, as were behaviours that elicit emotional arousal (being in a stressed or negative emotional state, having an unpleasant conversation, and not having enough time to relax before bed).",
              "Other behaviours that should be considered as negatively associated with sleep include not getting exposure to sunlight during the day, going to bed hungry or thirsty, using the bed for activities other than sleep, going to bed in a poorly ventilated environment, and sleeping on an uncomfortable mattress and/or pillows.",
              "Non-significant findings for approximately half of the most frequently used sleep hygiene behaviours warrants a closer inspection as to the situational and individual/dispositional characteristics that may influence whether these behaviours impact sleep (if at all).",
              "However, future research in the area should also consider narrowing the focus to shared common mechanisms, as well as incorporating perceptions of sleep hygiene to further establish the role they play in sleep.",

              "This guide will walk you through what you need to know before making a decision, including both critical attributes like volume control and additional functions like alarms and lights.",
              "By considering these eight important factors, it\u2019s easier to decide what features are important to you and what machine might work best for your needs.",
              "Sound Options White noise machines either play recorded sounds or mechanically generate white noise, usually with a fan.",
              "Choosing between these options is largely a matter of personal preference, though people interested in other sounds (such as waves or birdsong) will most likely prefer a machine with recorded sounds for a wider variety of options.",
              "Volume Options The volume of a white noise machine should be loud enough to cover noise pollution but not so loud as to interrupt sleep or damage hearing.",
              "This is particularly important for children, as studies have shown that excessively loud white noise can be especially harmful to them.",
              "Most white noise machines have a wide range of volume options and sensitive controls, though some lower-end or minimalist models may only allow you to choose between two or three volume settings.",
              "Value There are white noise machines available at virtually every price point, though the majority cost less than $100.",
              "Lower-priced models tend to have fewer features, while those at the higher end usually have lights, alarms, and/or other additional functions.",
              "These can offer a good value if you would otherwise buy a separate machine for these functions, but lower-priced white noise machines work well for those who are only interested in soothing sounds.",
              "Smart Features Just like so many other electronics, many white noise machines now offer smart features, like integration with apps or home networks.",
              "These models tend to also have other functions, such as lights or routines, that make app connectivity useful.",
              "For most situations, this is a non-essential feature, but parents may appreciate having this kind of control over their child\u2019s white noise machine.",
              "Display Light from a white noise machine can disrupt sleep, so it\u2019s crucial to choose a model with either minimal light or with lights that can be dimmed or turned off.",
              "Many well-made machines have no lights at all, while others have a clock screen or even function as a night light.",
              "The latter variety usually allows for more in-depth control, allowing owners to change the color and intensity of the light.",
              "Timers Some people prefer to have their white noise machine running all night, while others like to have it turn off automatically at a certain point.",
              "Most white noise machines have some kind of timing function, but this can range from preset automatic shut-offs to programmable on and off timers set through an app.",
              "Portability If you plan to take your white noise machine traveling, or even move it from room to room on a regular basis, it\u2019s worth considering its portability.",
              "While many white noise machines are quite small, particularly those without additional lighting features, they may require a plug-in outlet or weigh more than one might expect.",
              "Travel-friendly models, however, are likely to be lightweight and offer features like USB charging.",
              "Other Features As the white noise machine market is fairly crowded, many models try to set themselves apart with additional features.",
              "Alarms and lighting are both common, as are USB ports for charging your electronics.",
              "Headphone jacks are rarer but highly valued by those who share a room with a partner not interested in white noise or other sleep sounds.",
              "Depending on your needs, these features may be necessary, useful but not essential, or entirely unwanted.",
              "White noise contains all audible frequencies, which coalesce into what we perceive as a humming sound.",
              "Common everyday sources of white noise include fans, television static, and air conditioners.",
              "So-called \u201cwhite\u201d noise machines often produce pink or brown noises, which are like white noise with more intensity at the lower frequencies.",
              "These sounds are usually more calming, and many stereotypically relaxing sounds \u2014 including rain and waves \u2014 tend to be in this range.",
              "Blue, violet, and grey noises also exist but are less useful for relaxation.",
              "White, pink, and brown noises are all suitable for sleep, as are natural sounds that fall into these ranges.",
              "Since these sounds contain all audible frequencies, they \u201cfill in\u201d the gaps between unwanted noises that may otherwise wake us up.",
              "While white noise is generally thought to be safe, there are some risks and considerations to keep in mind.",
              "Any prolonged noise over 70 decibels \u2014 the level of a washing machine when standing next to it \u2014 can damage hearing, so it\u2019s crucial to keep white noise machines at a lower volume than this.",
              "There is also a small amount of evidence that regular white noise as a part of tinnitus therapy may cause long-term issues for those with tinnitus, but this is unlikely to be a concern for most people using white noise machines as part of their sleep routine.",
              "Nonetheless, if you have concerns or underlying health issues, it\u2019s always best to talk with your doctor before starting a new routine.",
              "White noise machines appear to be safe for children, regardless of age, so long as they are operated properly.",
              "One study has shown that many models are capable of being loud enough to damage an infant\u2019s hearing, but the study\u2019s authors were clear that the volume, machine position, and duration were all important factors in reducing this risk.",
              "They recommended placing the white noise machine some distance from the crib, playing it at a comfortable volume, and not using it over extended periods.",
              "White noise aids focus by blocking out noise pollution.",
              "Since it \u201cfills in\u201d the space between outside sounds, it thereby dampens them.",
              "For people who work in loud spaces or are easily distracted, this can make a significant difference in their focus.",
              "There are also some indications that white noise may affect perception and cognition depending on the timing and task at hand.",

              "Core body temperature continues to drop as you sleep, reaching a low point sometime in the early hours of the morning.",
              "This nightly drop in body temperature represents an important signal that tells your body it\u2019s time for sleep.",
              "But if the sleep environment is too hot or too cold, you may have a harder time falling asleep and staying asleep.",
              "High humidity can also have a negative impact on sleep, especially when combined with higher temperatures.",
              "For general comfort, most health experts recommend keeping indoor relative humidity levels somewhere between 30% and 50%.",

              "High levels of relative humidity can make the air feel hotter than the reading on the thermometer might suggest.",
              "For example, high humidity can make 85 degrees Fahrenheit feel more like 95 degrees Fahrenheit.",
              "When there\u2019s a lot of moisture in the air, sweat evaporates more slowly.",
              "As a result, your body has a harder time cooling itself down.",
              "This interferes with the normal nightly drop in core body temperature that helps to promote sleep.",

              "Low humidity levels can occur during the colder winter months, in dry climates, and when using a heater.",
              "This lack of moisture in the air may also lead to uncomfortable symptoms like dry itchy skin and eyes.",
              "In areas where the humidity is very low, a humidifier can help add moisture back into the air.",
              "Anyone who has been jolted awake by a sudden, loud sound understands the disrupting effect noise can have on sleep.",

              "Whatever the source, the effect of loud noise breaching the bedroom is typically the same.",
              "People exposed to noise at night tend to have lower quality sleep.",
              "When a person sleeps, they cycle through three stages of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and one stage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.",

              "The role sleep plays in physical activity levels has not been studied as thoroughly, and much of the research has focused on differences in physical activity between people with sleep disorders and people with healthier sleep.",
              "However, most of these studies have concluded that those who experience poor sleep are less active than those with healthy sleep cycles.",

              "People who are early risers or \u201cmorning people\u201d are more likely to engage in physical activity than those who sleep in or are more active in the evening.",
              "In fact, some studies have suggested that exercise can possibly alter one\u2019s diurnal preference over time, and may even shift their circadian rhythms. Although many studies to date have established a relationship between high-quality sleep and healthy physical activity levels, current research has not conclusively proven that better sleep leads to an increase in physical activity levels.",

              "One of the most eminent stressors in students\u2019 lives is academic stress (AS).",
              "1 Students report experiencing AS at predictable times each semester with the greatest extent at the end of a semester, resulting from taking and studying for exams, grade competition and the large amount of time invested in studying.",

              "6 It has been shown that AS has negative implications on physiological health variables, such as immune functions (suppresses cellular immunity while preserving humoral immunity)7 and neuroendocrine functions (increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels and cortisol levels, when perceiving high stress).",
              "8 Furthermore, in AS periods, different effects on psychological parameters can be detected, such as increased anxiety,9 poor sleep quality,10 a negative effect on well-being,11 increased negative affectivity12 and increases in the prevalence of depressive symptoms.13 Based on these findings, it can be assumed that times of high AS (ie, examination periods) have a negative impact on health-related physiological and psychological outcomes.",
              "Evidence suggests the relationship between stress and sleep quality to be bidirectional: 1) high stress levels have negative effects on sleep quality14 and 2) poor sleep quality affects subsequent stress levels.",
              "15 Regarding the effect of stress on sleep quality, a growing body of research suggests that high stress levels negatively influence sleep quality.",
              "16 Taking AS as the stress-evoking situation, a study conducted by Lund et al10 found that students with higher stress levels also report poorer sleep quality and more negative mood and illness.",
              "Regarding the reverse effect of sleep quality on stress, studies have shown that sleep deprivation (ie, poor sleep quality) potentiated stress responses of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis (ie, cortisol secretion) in a similar way as real stress does17 and that reactivity to a psychosocial laboratory stressor after sleep deprivation was increased compared to that in normal sleeping participants.",
              "These effects have also been shown for psychological stress outcomes, as participants with poor sleep quality showed significantly more fatigue and lower behavioral alertness.",
              "17,18 These results were also confirmed in a longitudinal approach with student\u2019s sleep quality and duration predicting mood and self-esteem, showing direct and indirect effects on academic performance.",
              "19 Well-being is commonly defined as the optimal functioning that enables an individual to live an effective life and to accomplish satisfaction in life and genuine happiness.",
              "20 It has been found to be inversely related to perceived stress in students,21 meaning that students show decreased well-being in high stress periods, whereby poor well-being also has a negative effect on health.",
              "22 Sugiura et al21 have shown that well-being has a protective role in the relationship between stress and health.",
              "To avoid any stress-induced health complaints in AS periods, well-being can be seen as a resource of mental health, which should be obtained even in phases of high stress.",
              "The impact of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA;",
              "or mood in common) is an important aspect of health behavior changes (ie, to change or maintain the healthy behavior even in times of high stress).",
              "23 Therefore, in an AS situation, changes in health behavior are often coupled with changes in affectivity, with a progression from positive affectivity to a negative one.",
              "Studies have shown that high levels of PA are positively correlated to desirable health behaviors such as nutrition or drug avoidance in low stress situations and therefore should be maintained in high stress periods.",
              "24 As opposed to this, this pattern changes in phases with high stress, showing significant increases in NA as well as decreases in PA and health-related outcomes (ie, depression, psychosomatic symptoms and chronic difficulties).",
              "25 Therefore, a temporally stable PA disposition may be related to adaptive health behaviors in AS periods.",
              "26 Taken together, it is well known that sleep quality, wellbeing and affectivity are negatively affected by stress and that their deterioration has negative impacts on general health.",
              "It needs to be asked, however, how healthy students in AS periods can counteract these negative effects of stress on health.",
              "Although there is evidence that physical activity and exercise (as part of behavioral activation interventions) can alleviate symptoms of depression,26 bipolar spectrum symptomatology27 or mood disorders28 in clinical student samples, less is known about their influence in healthy student populations.",
              "A meta-analysis conducted by Regehr et al29 found several interventions to counteract these negative implications.",
              "These authors stated that interventions can be divided into three subgroups, cognitive, behavioral and/or mindfulness-based techniques.",
              "Most of the studies found a positive effect of interventions on physiological and psychological stress parameters (eg, anxiety, depressive symptoms and well-being).",
              "However, it is surprising that physical activity does not appear as an intervention method in this review, as it is commonly known to positively affect physiological (ie, the cardiovascular system)30 and psychological health (ie, cognitive functions).",
              "31 Moreover, its positive effect on health-related outcomes in stressful situations is commonly known.",
              "The stress-buffering hypothesis, which was derived from the assumption of Cohen and Willis,32 who found social support to protect individuals from potentially pathogenetic effects of stress, is one of the most discussed assumptions on how physical activity might influence the stress-coping system.",
              "This hypothesis postulates that physical activity (which is hereafter used as a hypernym, including all exercise activities and activities with exercise character such as bicycling) might act as a moderator of the stress\u2013health relationship by reducing the detrimental effects of stress on physical and mental health and therefore can buffer the negative effects of stress on health.",
              "33,34 This hypothesis has been verified in many studies for acute activity35 as well as for habitual, regular activity.",
              "33 Based on these findings, the present study was conducted to shed light on the question whether those students, who are regularly physically active, have higher sleep quality, higher well-being and higher PA in AS periods than those who do not.",
              "In the present study, the regular examination period at the end of each semester therefore serves as a naturalistic stressor for studying the effects of stress on health outcomes.",
              "In particular, it is hypothesized that 1) sleep quality, well-being and PA decrease (NA increases) over time from baseline to AS period in all subjects.",
              "Moreover, it is assumed that 2) physically active students \u2013 while progressing from baseline to AS period \u2013 show better sleep quality, higher well-being and more positive and less negative affectivity than their inactive counterparts.",

              "Whereas NA is accepted to predict increased risk of illness and mortality, PA is associated with lower morbidity and decreased symptoms.57,58 It is known that AS periods have a negative impact on affective state with NA increased and PA decreased during times of high academic demands,24 which was replicated in the present findings.",
              "However, there is extensive evidence for the proposition that physical activity or exercise is associated with enhanced affect and mood59 and therefore can buffer the negative effects of stress on affectivity.",

              "62 However, there is a lack of evidence for this relationship in university students.",
              "Therefore, future research should aim at examining whether these positive effects do also emerge in AS periods and whether they are a direct effect of physical activity, or whether they are mediated by an increase in positive affectivity or other health-related variables.",
              "The major strengths of this study include the longitudinal design and the usage of AS as a naturalistic stressor.",
              "However, the inclusion of only one baseline measure may have been inadequate.",
              "For future studies, it may be of interest to include more than one baseline measure in times of little stress to determine if there is any variability in the dependent variables outside of high stress times.",

              "Results of the present study point to the importance of physical activity in AS periods.",
              "Therefore, it can be assumed that the results can provide the basis for activity interventions, which can be offered to students in AS periods to help them maintain their activity levels to buffer the negative effects of stress on health.",
              "Another limitation of the present study is that only self-report measures were used.",
              "In terms of the activity measure, this might have led to an erroneous assessment of the actual amount of physical activity due to social desirable responding.",
              "In this vein, a study conducted by Dyrstad et al revealed that people tend to overestimate their activity time ascertained via self-report measures when compared to accelerometer data.",
              "63 However, participants of the present study reported decreasing amounts of activity during the AS phase.",
              "Therefore, the potential overestimation of physical activity time might only be present as an additive shift that might not lead to a distorted representation of the process modeled within the AS period.",
              "However, future studies might use more objective measures, such as accelerometers, for effective activity time and the intensity of the given activity.",
              "In this regard, intensity levels or metabolic equivalents (METs) of physical activity could play an important role.",
              "It might be that either the intensity of activities per se or the kind of activity moderates the described effects.",
              "Moreover, there are still significant variance components for every conditional model, within both the intercepts and the slopes, that call for additional moderating variables to explain this variability.",
              "Owing to personality factors of participants or organizational or cultural conditions, it may be that students have the same amount of stress but cope differently and therefore differ in their perceived amount of stress, as proposed in the transactional theory.",
              "64 Therefore, future studies should examine time-invariant variables, such as organizational skills, coping style, year in college, difficulty of classes, number of credits taken in the semester, other academic pursuits, outside academic responsibilities and personality or organizational culture within different faculties, which can then be integrated on level 2 in the described model.",
              "Moreover, additional health-related variables should be included in the following examinations, such as diet, smoking status and drug abuse.",
              "Taken together, the results of the present study suggest a positive effect of physical activity on sleep quality, wellbeing and affect in AS periods.",
              "This effect, however, seems to depend on the total amount of activity made within the stress period.",
              "Therefore, it should be students\u2019 goal to maintain their physical activity levels (or even to start exercising) in times with high (academic) stress.",
              "Moderate intensity activity of 150 minutes/week seems to be enough to profit from the stress-buffering and health-promoting effects.",
              "It needs to be asked, however, if an amount of 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week is really reconcilable with the imminent work load within the AS phase.",
              "If an average student gets lectures for 6\u20138 hours a day, studies for another 6\u20138 hours for exams and may need to go to work to fund his studying, it is hardly surprising that students save time by decreasing their activity times.",
