    "query": "What is the most innovative and sustainable solution currently being developed to address the issue of water scarcity, and how does it compare to traditional methods of water conservation and management?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. There are many innovative and sustainable solutions being developed to address the issue of water scarcity, but one of them is **fog water harvesting**[^1^]. This is a method of collecting water from fog using a vertical mesh that intercepts the droplet stream. This water then runs down into a water collection, storage and distribution system. Fog water harvesting is a low-maintenance option and a green technology to supply drinking water in dry areas where fog is intense and happens regularly, such as dry mountainous and coastal regions[^1^].\n\nFog water harvesting is different from traditional methods of water conservation and management, such as rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge, desalination, wastewater reuse and demand management. These methods rely on conventional sources of water, such as rainfall, river runoff and groundwater, which are being affected by climate change and increasing demand. Fog water harvesting, on the other hand, taps into an unconventional source of water that is not dependent on precipitation or aquifer levels. Fog water harvesting also has lower energy requirements and environmental impacts than some of the traditional methods, such as desalination and wastewater reuse[^1^].\n\nHowever, fog water harvesting is not a panacea for water scarcity. It has some limitations, such as the variability of fog occurrence and intensity, the need for suitable geography and topography for optimal fog interception, the potential for contamination by pollutants or microorganisms in the fog, and the challenges of scaling up and maintaining the systems[^1^]. Therefore, fog water harvesting needs to be used in conjunction with other methods of water conservation and management, and in accordance with the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda for the benefit of our planet[^1^].",

              "A key element would be greater awareness among potential donors and the private sector's active engagement to fast-track and sustain fog water collection systems. As our typical practices relying on conventional water supplies are not enough when facing today's water shortages, it is time to think beyond rivers, pipes, wells, and pumps.",
              "As concerns over water scarcity continue to grow, the \u201cbright spots\u201d of fog water harvesting systems shed light on how creative responses to resource stresses can alleviate tensions and support water-related sustainable development.",
              "This is crucially important in an era when achieving water-related sustainable development is a grand challenge for countries where communities suffer water shortages [United Nations (UN), 2018] while the potential to recover water from air remains under-explored (UN-Water, 2020).",
              "The international research community needs to continue to explore these systems and other unconventional approaches to water collection to best address water scarcity while supporting equity around our planet's most precise resource.",

              "By definition, fog is a cloud that touches the ground containing water particles from 1 to 40 microns.",
              "In the context of harvesting moisture from fog as a resource, three types are relevant: advection, orographic and radiation fog [5].",
              "Advection fog is formed through warm, humid air masses moving horizontally over a cooler surface, such as the sea.",
              "Orographic fog is formed by humid air masses that move upward along the land acting as an orographic obstacle.",
              "At a certain height, the air expands.",
              "Both are characterized by relatively strong winds, whereas radiation fog, which is an accumulation of a large stable cold air mass formed during a cold period mostly situated inland, is characterized by a low wind speed making it the least interesting for harvest.",
              "[11] Aside from wind speed, which typically ranges from 2 to 12 m/s, the LWC (Liquid Water Content) is an important factor for fog collecting and is the amount and size of droplets in a cloud [5].",
              "Along the coasts of South America, Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, various fog oases are found.",
              "These are characterized by aridity, but organisms survive through the presence of (seasonal) low stratocumulus [12, 13].",
              "Moreover, tropical highlands that experience seasonal droughts, such as the Chiapas region in Mexico and the Philippines, can benefit from fog collection [14].",
              "Organisms living in places where water is scarce rely mostly on fog and have developed efficient ways to capture water out of the air.",
              "Natural fog collection occurs in trees, for example, in coniferous redwoods.",
              "The quantity of harvested water depends on the tree\u2019s structure and the leaf\u2019s wettability properties in relation to the present foggy wind.",
              "In advantageous conditions, little droplets coalesce on the leaves and fall on the ground through which the roots can absorb the droplets [10].",
              "Ancient communities captured this fresh water by digging wells under the trees [15].",
              "The Tillandsia landbeckii is known for being one of the sole organisms that thrives in the arid Atacama Desert by intercepting fog.",
              "The plant absorbs water through its fibre-like leaves, or trichomes, whereafter it is stored efficiently through its thick layer resulting in water losses close to zero [16, 17].",
              "A cactus native to the Mexican desert has developed barbs on its spines facilitating the interception of droplets, whereafter they grow and move towards the base of the tip due to the Laplace pressure gradient and where they are absorbed by the cactus\u2019 thick flesh [18].",
              "Animals also have developed efficient ways to harvest moisture such as the fog basking ability of the Namib Desert beetle.",
              "Its back skin is made of alternating hydrophilic areas, whereon droplets congregate, and hydrophobic areas, allowing the droplets to funnel down to the beetle\u2019s mouth [19].",

              "Aside from the LWC and the wind speed, the mesh\u2019s geometrical aspects and physical properties such as the surface wettability determine the collection rate [20, 21].",
              "Thus, the thickness of the fibres and the percentage of the covered surface have a direct effect on the harvest efficiency.",
              "A smaller fibre size results in a better efficiency than one of 10 mm whereas the coverage of the surface cannot obstruct the wind completely to assure that the fog-loaded wind passes through [10].",
              "The efficiency of the mesh is usually measured by the ratio of the amount of water that reached the gutter and the total amount of droplets that passed through the mesh over a defined period [22].",

              "The frame is attached to two poles, anchored 2 m above the ground.",
              "These poles are strengthened by cables with turnbuckles that need to be strengthened or loosened depending on the climatic situation.",

              "The current and past LFC installations demonstrate the high potential to supply rural communities with adequate amounts of water but show significant problems due to their lack of engineering and high-maintenance needs compromising the sustainability.",
              "Climatic issues refer mostly to breakage due to harsh weather conditions.",

              "Afterwards, the collector was built, with a strongly engaged community resulting in a request for additional LFCs [29].",
              "In spite of fog being difficult to predict, this is an economic and ecologic resource from which enterprises and organizations can benefit.",
              "Moreover, when the water supply for the local population is delivered by conventional means, their domestic water supply is not affected during fog-scarce periods, generally resulting in a strong involvement of the employees for managing and maintaining the collectors.",
              "In the rural village Falda Verde (Chile), 11 LFCs supplied the irrigation of commercial aloe vera from 2001.",
              "An annual average of 1.",

              "A research project in the 1980s led to the first large-scale fog collection project worldwide in a small Chilean fisher village, Chungungo, using 100 LFCs of 48 m2 overlooking the village.",
              "The collectors harvested an average of 15 000 l/day (\u223c3 l/m2/day) over a 10-year period flowing directly into the village and supplying 300 inhabitants [5, 10].",
              "This generated a visible increase in economic resources [20].",
              "The community managed the system, but after administrative problems, growth of the permanent population pressuring the water system, absent funds, storms destroying the LFC\u2019s rigid 2D structure and the mesh if not regulated properly, and a pending request for a connection to a conventional pipeline, the system was slowly neglected.",
              "During the project, the unreliability of fog water in some period led to the supplementation with truck-delivered water, as it was done before and soon enough it switched back to this expensive resource [34, 35].",
              "A reforestation project to rehabilitate the Lomas\u2019 ecosystem in Meija (Peru) was established in 1995 with 20 LFCs.",

              "In Lepelfontein, one collector with a mesh surface of 70 m2 supplied a local community from 1999 to 2001, and in Soutpansberg, seven collectors supplied a local school from 2001 to 2008 [10, 39].",

              "After 3 years, strong winds destroyed the midscale project [41].",
              "The sustainability of a project mostly depends on the beneficiaries\u2019 commitment to maintaining and monitoring the collectors [10].",
              "The communities\u2019 commitment decreases when climatic-related problems occur, especially when they were not motivated nor prepared for this alternative.",
              "Experience revealed that individually owned and/or self-bought collectors accomplish a higher degree of commitment [42], because generally, a community consists of different families.",
              "This suggests that there is no direct ownership and no feeling of responsibility on an individual level causing conflicts, abandonment or both.",
              "Besides, some locals do not possess economic and technical resources nor spare time whereas the collectors demand daily surveillance [25].",
              "The role of a local NGO is therefore crucial to introduce and inform the beneficiaries about the fog harvesting mechanism through a public programme with great sensitivity to local traditions.",
              "After the collectors are handed over to the community, NGOs are expected to assist and conduct routine evaluations, but these are often irregular or obsolete [43].",
              "In most cases, governmental aid is required for subsidies and leadership [14].",
              "However, multiple fog-loaded arid regions are prone to governmental restrictions because they do not consider fog collection to be a national water policy, ergo, do not provide action plans [44].",

              "All collectors described operate with a mesh and are passive, using merely natural driven forces without requiring external energy.",
              "Additionally, a common innovative design aspect is that they all use a three-dimensional design whereas the LFC has a two-dimensional set-up catching water from one direction, while the wind direction can be variable [45].",
              "Only \u223c2% of the total moisture passing the RM is harvested and the efficiency decreases remarkably due to factors such as clogging, coalescence of droplets and loss of droplets re-joining the wind [46].",
              "Experimental research by Rajaram et al.",
              "[47] illustrates the great potential for improvement of the RM by applying coatings and changing geometrical features.",

              "The results revealed that, under similar conditions, the meshes showed inconsistent results.",
              "Nonetheless, compared to the RM, the FogHa-Tin produced better results at lower wind speeds and the MIT-14 produced better results at all wind speeds [48].",

Although there is still some funding available to run the project, the economic trade-offs continue to be a concern as the new CloudFisher technology's cost is high.",
              "Overall, the project has been a big success, sustainably supplying potable water in enough quantities to about 1,000 villagers.",
              "While not a problem-free initiative, this is the most extensive fog-harvesting system representing truly a \u201cbright spot\u201d in both unconventional water supply techniques and locally led development interventions.",
              "Amid increasing water scarcity, fog water harvesting has gained attention in academic research and community-based applications on the ground in the past three decades.",
              "Over 350 publications have addressed fog water collection from the atmosphere.",
              "The literature review reveals that most of the studies focused on technical features, with a few studies addressing the importance of gender mainstreaming and community-led development and addressing the critical role of relevant policies and supportive institutions to promote and support fog water collection systems. Although no adverse environmental effects of fog water harvesting have been reported on local vegetation, insects, and the ecosystem at large, there is a need to undertake studies on the governance and transboundary implications of fog water collection systems. As localized water scarcity is worsening in many regions, the operational examples of fog water collection highlight the importance of harvested fog water for the associated people's benefits.",
              "The beneficial effects can be enhanced by engaging the communities and their leadership, addressing local water needs, ensuring water security, mainstreaming gender roles and responsibilities, and accessing and using appropriate technologies.",
              "Such benefits warrant community-based work, multi-stakeholder participation, private-sector engagement, and government support, particularly local government, and its related institutions.",
              "Even though the number of fog water collection projects has grown over time, there remains a tremendous potential for further development.",
              "Several of these projects could not continue operations over the long run due to specific social, economic, and political challenges.",
              "Also, weak local institutions, limited or no private-sector engagement, unclear stakeholder responsibilities, funding uncertainties, and lack of support from local government have had a severe negative impact on fog water collection projects.",
              "If not addressed under specific situations, such factors result in disruptions and, in extreme cases, failures.",
              "With a comprehensive approach to addressing water scarcity, there is an opportunity to explore and harness fog water collection potential in dry areas with frequent fog events throughout the year.",
              "This can be achieved by incorporating fog water collection as one of the water resources management strategies in the national water policies and implementing action plans in countries where biophysical conditions are conducive for fog water collection.",
              "Such adjustments to the national water policies supported by pertinent investment and financing action plans should be backed by comparing the value proposition of fog water collection systems to other possible water sources in terms of economic, societal, social, educational, environmental, and health trade-offs.",
              "Capacity needs assessments and need-focused capacity building would be crucial in planning and executing sustainable community-based fog collection systems. Although technological developments in fog collection systems have received continued attention, it is essential to keep this momentum up and enhance interest within the relevant research community.",
              "For example, organizations like FogQuest (http://www.",
              "fogquest.",
              "org/) and FogNet Alliance (https://www.",
              "fognetalliance.",
              "org/) have demonstrated the importance of fog harvesting knowledge and best practices by identifying pertinent innovations and their implementation through functional networks of researchers, water professionals, communities, local institutions, and governmental and non-governmental organizations.",
              "A key element would be greater awareness among potential donors and the private sector's active engagement to fast-track and sustain fog water collection systems. As our typical practices relying on conventional water supplies are not enough when facing today's water shortages, it is time to think beyond rivers, pipes, wells, and pumps.",
              "As concerns over water scarcity continue to grow, the \u201cbright spots\u201d of fog water harvesting systems shed light on how creative responses to resource stresses can alleviate tensions and support water-related sustainable development.",
              "This is crucially important in an era when achieving water-related sustainable development is a grand challenge for countries where communities suffer water shortages [United Nations (UN), 2018] while the potential to recover water from air remains under-explored (UN-Water, 2020).",
              "The international research community needs to continue to explore these systems and other unconventional approaches to water collection to best address water scarcity while supporting equity around our planet's most precise resource.",

              "In the context of harvesting moisture from fog as a resource, three types are relevant: advection, orographic and radiation fog [5].",
              "Advection fog is formed through warm, humid air masses moving horizontally over a cooler surface, such as the sea.",
              "Orographic fog is formed by humid air masses that move upward along the land acting as an orographic obstacle.",
              "At a certain height, the air expands.",
              "Both are characterized by relatively strong winds, whereas radiation fog, which is an accumulation of a large stable cold air mass formed during a cold period mostly situated inland, is characterized by a low wind speed making it the least interesting for harvest.",
              "[11] Aside from wind speed, which typically ranges from 2 to 12 m/s, the LWC (Liquid Water Content) is an important factor for fog collecting and is the amount and size of droplets in a cloud [5].",
              "Along the coasts of South America, Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, various fog oases are found.",
              "These are characterized by aridity, but organisms survive through the presence of (seasonal) low stratocumulus [12, 13].",
              "Moreover, tropical highlands that experience seasonal droughts, such as the Chiapas region in Mexico and the Philippines, can benefit from fog collection [14].",
              "Organisms living in places where water is scarce rely mostly on fog and have developed efficient ways to capture water out of the air.",
              "Natural fog collection occurs in trees, for example, in coniferous redwoods.",
              "The quantity of harvested water depends on the tree\u2019s structure and the leaf\u2019s wettability properties in relation to the present foggy wind.",
              "In advantageous conditions, little droplets coalesce on the leaves and fall on the ground through which the roots can absorb the droplets [10].",
              "Ancient communities captured this fresh water by digging wells under the trees [15].",
              "The Tillandsia landbeckii is known for being one of the sole organisms that thrives in the arid Atacama Desert by intercepting fog.",
              "The plant absorbs water through its fibre-like leaves, or trichomes, whereafter it is stored efficiently through its thick layer resulting in water losses close to zero [16, 17].",
              "A cactus native to the Mexican desert has developed barbs on its spines facilitating the interception of droplets, whereafter they grow and move towards the base of the tip due to the Laplace pressure gradient and where they are absorbed by the cactus\u2019 thick flesh [18].",

              "Its back skin is made of alternating hydrophilic areas, whereon droplets congregate, and hydrophobic areas, allowing the droplets to funnel down to the beetle\u2019s mouth [19].",

              "To ease runoff and obtain a shading coefficient of \u223c70%, a double layer able to move against each other is used.",
              "Aside from the LWC and the wind speed, the mesh\u2019s geometrical aspects and physical properties such as the surface wettability determine the collection rate [20, 21].",
              "Thus, the thickness of the fibres and the percentage of the covered surface have a direct effect on the harvest efficiency.",
              "A smaller fibre size results in a better efficiency than one of 10 mm whereas the coverage of the surface cannot obstruct the wind completely to assure that the fog-loaded wind passes through [10].",
              "The efficiency of the mesh is usually measured by the ratio of the amount of water that reached the gutter and the total amount of droplets that passed through the mesh over a defined period [22].",
              "An LFC (Figure 3) is a two-dimensional water harvesting mechanism with a flat frame of 4 \u00d7 10 m wherein a double RM is stretched.",

              "According to Garay, through an expert interview, the communication with the community was challenging, and he spent years gaining trust and introducing the fog harvesting mechanism to them.",
              "The structure is based on tensegrity, which is an architectural principle of components under tension.",
              "The collector is easy to transport and construct and requires a minimum of maintenance owing to its flexible structure.",
              "To keep it low-cost and low-tech, material that is easy to find is used such as PVC tubes for the structure and metal cables to keep the structure in place.",
              "Instead of using the Chilean RM, a more robust mesh of monofilaments is used.",
              "A total of 27-m2 mesh is loosely attached through multiple holders within the tensed network, allowing the mesh to fluctuate and reducing the tendency of breakage under harsh weather conditions.",
              "In Caldera, an average of 20 l/day is accumulated by one collector during the winter fog season.",
              "A unique feature of this design is that the fluctuating mesh allows intercepted droplets blown off by winds to be recovered.",
              "Coalesced droplets can also roll down the mesh as typically observed.",
              "A plastic slab catches all the mesh-intercepted droplets, covering an area greater than the ground surface of the collector, and is directed to a gutter connected to a cistern.",

              "While the collector is currently in exploratory phase collecting water to supply one person, Garay intends to build NIEBLAs for domestic and agricultural use for rural families.",
              "With national funding, the collector could also serve as a refuge for people and animals seeking shade in the Atacama Desert on routes that are used by the rural population moving daily with their animals, enhancing the quality of their trips, and providing potable water [69, 70].",
              "The Warka Water Tower is a freestanding cylindrical wooden collector developed by architect Arturo Vittori to harvest fog, rain, and dew using a polyester mesh similar to the RM.",
              "The prototype is in exploratory phase intending to obtain a daily average of 40\u201380 l.",
              "The innovation of the 9-m-high tower lays in the fact that it is prefabricated, lightweight (80 kg), quickly built and easy to maintain through a minimal knowledge of tools.",
              "Moreover, it uses recyclable and local materials such as bamboo and is designed to be operated and owned by the locals [56, 71].",
              "The fog-collecting mechanism and materials of the tower are inspired by organisms\u2019 hydrophobic or hydrophilic surfaces, or both, such as the Namib beetle\u2019s back, lotus flower leaves, spider webs and cacti.",
              "A promising first and second of 12 designs have already been constructed in Ethiopia and Cameroon, respectively.",
              "The price of the collector is unknown because of its large dependence on local materials, workforces and remoteness of the area [71].",
              "A large canopy can be added around the structure for community gathering events [72], implicating that one Warka Tower is aimed for placement within and for the entire community living in fog-loaded areas, excluding the need for extensive pipelines, whereas the LFCs are mostly placed uphill near beneficiary villages.",
              "Water is a vital resource for all living creatures.",
              "Fog is essential for natural organisms to survive in arid climates, and researchers have learned a lot about this evolutionary phenomenon.",
              "Fog harvesting, being relatively new, clearly has great potential with an exciting interdisciplinarity blending biomimicry, indigenous knowledge, sociology, engineering and sciences.",

              "Most of these projects are intended for placement in specific rural fog-loaded areas where the population needs to rely on unreliable expensive truck-delivered water or where they need to spend full days walking to open wells or river basins.",
              "Besides, collecting possible contaminated water results in a high number of water-borne diseases and other health issues, hence the large benefits of fog collection for underprivileged communities.",
              "To conclude, some suggestions for future research are discussed.",
              "First, various factors need to be considered before implementing collectors within a community.",
              "The absent participation of communities, and obsolete local NGOs has a great influence on the failure of a project, calling for focused research to develop an adapted approach to communicate and educate rural people in need.",
              "Second, although the conceptual designs are more flexible and constructed with lightweight materials, studies show that strong winds require more robust structures, exposing the need for more extensive experiments in remote areas.",
              "Third, due to climate change and urbanization, water scarcity is becoming a bigger problem in arid metropolitan areas.",
              "One-third of the urban population, or 993 million, already experiences water stress [73].",
              "Therefore, research towards urban-integrated fog collectors is highly recommended, especially in vulnerable urban areas.",
              "Lastly, collecting rainwater is a common practice for people living in rainy areas, regardless of their status.",
              "The average or wealthier population that are connected to a conventional water network living in fog-loaded arid regions do not profit from atmospheric moisture, which is a lost opportunity, mostly because they do not feel nor consider water scarcity to be a problem.",
              "Integrating this alternative as a (complementary) water resource into moderate households, with the help of governmental regulations, creates a sustainable freshwater supply and ultimately a sustainable future, and could positively change the opinion of the less fortunate.",
