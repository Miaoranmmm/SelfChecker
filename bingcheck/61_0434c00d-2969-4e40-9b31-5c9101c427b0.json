    "response": "The first camera was invented in **1816** by French inventor **Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce**[^1^] [^4^]. He was inspired by the **camera obscura**, a natural optical phenomenon that projects an inverted image of a scene through a small hole onto a surface[^2^]. He used a **paper coated with silver chloride**, which would produce a negative of the image[^4^]. However, these images were not permanent and would fade over time. In **1826**, he used a different process called **heliography**, which involved exposing a pewter plate coated with bitumen to light. This produced the first permanent photograph ever, which captured the view out of his window at his home in France[^1^] [^5^]. He called his device a **heliograph** or a **sun drawing**[^5^].",

              "Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce, (born March 7, 1765, Chalon-sur-Sao\u0302ne, France\u2014died July 5, 1833, Chalon-sur-Sao\u0302ne), French inventor who was the first to make a permanent photographic image.",
              "The son of a wealthy family suspected of royalist sympathies, Nie\u0301pce fled the French Revolution but returned to serve in the French army under Napoleon Bonaparte.",
              "Dismissed because of ill health, he settled near his native town of Chalon-sur-Sao\u0302ne, where he remained engaged in research for the rest of his life.",
              "In 1807 Nie\u0301pce and his brother Claude invented an internal-combustion engine, which they called the Pyre\u0301olophore, explaining that the word was derived from a combination of the Greek words for \u201cfire,\u201d \u201cwind,\u201d and \u201cI produce.",
              "\u201d Working on a piston-and-cylinder system similar to 20th-century gasoline-powered engines, the Pyre\u0301olophore initially used lycopodium powder for fuel, and Nie\u0301pce claimed to have used it to power a boat.",
              "When lithography became a fashionable hobby in France in 1813, Nie\u0301pce began to experiment with the then-novel printing technique.",
              "Unskilled in drawing, and unable to obtain proper lithographic stone locally, he sought a way to provide images automatically.",
              "He coated pewter with various light-sensitive substances in an effort to copy superimposed engravings in sunlight.",
              "From this he progressed in April 1816 to attempts at photography, which he called heliography (sundrawing), with a camera.",
              "He recorded a view from his workroom window on paper sensitized with silver chloride but was only partially able to fix the image.",
              "Next he tried various types of supports for the light-sensitive material bitumen of Judea, a kind of asphalt, which hardens on exposure to light.",
              "Using this material he succeeded in 1822 in obtaining a photographic copy of an engraving superimposed on glass.",
              "In 1826/27, using a camera, he made a view from his workroom on a pewter plate, this being the first permanently fixed image from nature.",
              "Metal had the advantage of being unbreakable and was better suited to the subsequent etching process to produce a printing plate, which was Nie\u0301pce\u2019s final aim.",
              "In 1826, he had produced another heliograph, a reproduction of an engraved portrait, which was etched by the Parisian engraver Augustin-Franc\u0327ois Lemai\u0302tre, who pulled two prints.",
              "Thus Nie\u0301pce not only solved the problem of reproducing nature by light, but he invented the first photomechanical reproduction process.",
              "While on a visit to England in 1827, Nie\u0301pce addressed a memorandum on his invention to the Royal Society, London, but his insistence on keeping the method secret prevented the matter from being investigated.",
              "Unable to reduce the very long exposure times by either chemical or optical means, Nie\u0301pce in 1829 finally gave in to the repeated overtures of Louis-Jacques-Mande\u0301 Daguerre, a Parisian painter, for a partnership to perfect and exploit heliography.",
              "Nie\u0301pce died without seeing any further advance, but, building on his knowledge, and working with his materials, Daguerre eventually succeeded in greatly reducing the exposure time through his discovery of a chemical process for development of (making visible) the latent (invisible) image formed upon brief exposure.",
              "These experiments eventually led him to invent the daguerreotype, the first successful form of photography."

              "The First Photographer When posed with the question as to who it was who actually took the very first photograph, there is little argument today that it was Joseph Nicephor Nie\u0301pce.",
              "Nie\u0301pce was born in France on March 7, 1765.",
              "He was one of three children with a father who was a wealthy attorney.",
              "The family was forced to flee the area when the French revolution began.",
              "Nie\u0301pce was named Joseph, but while studying at the Oratorian College in Angers, he decided to adopt the name Nice\u0301phore in honor of Saint Nicephorus the ninth-century Patriarch of Constantinople.",
              "His studies taught him experimental methods in science and he graduated to become a professor at the college.",
              "Nie\u0301pce served as a staff officer in the French army under Napoleon.",
              "During his years in the service, the majority of his time was spent in Italy and on the island of Sardinia.",
              "He resigned his post due to illness.",
              "After leaving the service he married Agnes Romero and became Administrator of the district of Nice.",
              "He left this position to further pursue scientific research with his older brother Claude at their families estate in Chalon.",
              "He was reunited at the family home with his mom, sister and younger brother Bernard.",
              "Not only did he pursue his scientific research, but he also managed the family estate.",
              "The brothers served as wealthy gentlemen-farmers, raising beets and producing sugar.",
              "Nie\u0301pce is believed to have taken the world\u2019s first photographic etching in 1822.",
              "Using a camera obscura, a box with a hole in one side which utilizes light from an external scene, he took an engraving of Pope Pius VII.",
              "This image was later destroyed by the scientist when he attempted to duplicate it.",
              "Two of his attempts did however survive.",
              "One was a man and his horse, and the other a woman sitting at a spinning wheel.",
              "Nie\u0301pce\u2019s main problem was an unsteady hand and weak drawing skills, which led him to attempt to find a way to capture images permanently without relying on his poor drawing skills.",
              "Nie\u0301pce experimented with the use of silver chloride, which darkened when exposed to light, but found it was not sufficient to produce the results he desired.",
              "He then moved on to bitumen, which led him to his first successful attempt at capturing a nature image.",
              "His process involved dissolving bitumen in lavender oil, which is a solvent often used in varnish.",
              "He then coated a sheet of pewter with this mixture and placed it inside a camera obscura.",
              "Eight hours later he removed it and washed it with lavender oil to remove any unexposed bitumen.",
              "The picture itself was not very memorable as it was a building, a barn, and a tree.",
              "It was believed to be the courtyard outside his house.",
              "However, since the process was such a slow one, taking over 8 hours, the sun moved from one side of the image to the other making it appear as if the sun was coming from two sides of the photo.",
              "This process would later inspire Louis Daguerre\u2019s highly successful mercury vapor development process.",
              "It had taken him over twenty years of experimenting with optical images before he had this success.",
              "The earlier problem had been that although he was able to set optical images, they would fade quickly.",
              "The earliest surviving photo from Nie\u0301pce is from 1825.",
              "He named his new process a Heliograph, after the Greek word for \u201cof the sun.",
              "\u201d Once Nie\u0301pce had the success he desired he decided to travel to England to try to promote his new invention to the Royal Society.",
              "Unfortunately, he was met with total failure.",
              "The Society has a rule stating that it would not promote any discovery with an undisclosed secret.",
              "Certainly, Nie\u0301pce was not prepared to share his secrets with the world, so he returned to France disappointed that he was unable to make a success of his new invention.",
              "In France, Nie\u0301pce formed an alliance with Louis Daguerre.",
              "In 1829 they began collaborating to improve the process.",
              "They remained partners for the next four years until Nie\u0301pce\u2019s death from a stroke in 1833 at the age of 69.",
              "Daguerre continued working on the process after Nie\u0301pce\u2019s death eventually developing a process that, although based on their original findings, was much different than what Nie\u0301pce had created.",
              "He named it the Daguerreotype, after himself.",
              "He managed to get the government of France to purchase his invention on behalf of the people of France.",
              "In 1939 the French government agreed to pay Daguerre a yearly stipend of 6,000 Francs for the rest of his life, and to pay the estate of Nie\u0301pce 4,000 Francs yearly.",
              "Nie\u0301pce\u2019s son was not happy with this arrangement, claiming that Daguerre was receiving benefits for what his father had created.",
              "Nie\u0301pce actually received little credit for anything to do with this creation until 1952 when historians Alison and Helmut Gernsheim rediscovered Nie\u0301pce\u2019s original images.",
              "It was this discovery that allowed the world to learn about Nie\u0301pce\u2019s \"heliographic\" process and allow the world to realize that this was the first successful example of what we now call photography: an image created on a light-sensitive surface, by the action of light.",
              "Although Nie\u0301pce is most noted for his invention in the photographic area, he also had several previous successes as an inventor.",
              "Among Nie\u0301pce's other inventions was the Pyreolophore, the world\u2019s first internal combustion engine, which he conceived and created with his brother Claude.",

              "Joseph Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce (French: [nisef\u0254\u0281 nj\u025bps];",
              "7 March 1765 \u2013 5 July 1833)[1] was a French inventor and one of the earliest pioneers of photography.",
              "[2] Nie\u0301pce developed heliography, a technique he used to create the world's oldest surviving product of a photographic process: a print made from a photoengraved printing plate in 1825 (see View from the Window at Le Gras).",
              "[3] In 1826 or 1827, he used a primitive camera to produce the oldest surviving photograph of a real-world scene.",
              "Among Nie\u0301pce's other inventions was the Pyre\u0301olophore, one of the world's first internal combustion engines, which he conceived, created, and developed with his older brother Claude Nie\u0301pce.",
              "[4] Nie\u0301pce was born in Chalon-sur-Sao\u0302ne, Sao\u0302ne-et-Loire, where his father was a wealthy lawyer.",
              "His older brother Claude (1763\u20131828) was also his collaborator in research and invention, but died half-mad and destitute in England, having squandered the family wealth in pursuit of non-opportunities for the Pyre\u0301olophore.",
              "Nie\u0301pce also had a sister and a younger brother, Bernard.",
              "[5][6][7] Nice\u0301phore was baptized Joseph but adopted the name Nice\u0301phore, in honour of Saint Nicephorus the ninth-century Patriarch of Constantinople, while studying at the Oratorian college in Angers.",
              "At the college he learned science and the experimental method, rapidly achieving success and graduating to work as a professor of the college.",
              "Nie\u0301pce served as a staff officer in the French army under Napoleon, spending a number of years in Italy and on the island of Sardinia, but ill health forced him to resign, whereupon he married Agnes Romero and became the Administrator of the district of Nice in post-revolutionary France.",
              "In 1795, he resigned as administrator of Nice to pursue scientific research with his brother Claude.",
              "One source reports his resignation to have been forced due to his unpopularity.",
              "[5][6][7] In 1801 the brothers returned to the family's estates in Chalon to continue their scientific research, and where they were united with their mother, their sister and their younger brother Bernard.",
              "Here they managed the family estate as independently wealthy gentlemen-farmers, raising beets and producing sugar.",
              "[5][6][7] In 1827 Nie\u0301pce journeyed to England to visit his seriously ill elder brother Claude Nie\u0301pce, who was now living in Kew, near London.",
              "Claude had descended into delirium and squandered much of the family fortune chasing inappropriate business opportunities for the Pyre\u0301olophore.",
              "[5] Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce died of a stroke on 5 July 1833, financially ruined such that his grave in the cemetery of Saint-Loup de Varennes was financed by the municipality.",
              "The cemetery is near the family house where he had experimented and had made the world's oldest surviving photographic image.",
              "[6] His son Isidore (1805\u20131868) formed a partnership with Daguerre after his father's death and was granted a government pension in 1839 in return for disclosing the technical details of Nice\u0301phore's heliogravure process.",
              "[5][6] A cousin, Claude Fe\u0301lix Abel Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor (1805\u20131870), was a chemist and was the first to use albumen in photography.",
              "He also produced photographic engravings on steel.",
              "During 1857\u20131861, he discovered that uranium salts emit a form of radiation that is invisible to the human eye.",
              "[8] The date of Nie\u0301pce's first photographic experiments is uncertain.",
              "He was led to them by his interest in the new art of lithography,[9] for which he realized he lacked the necessary skill and artistic ability, and by his acquaintance with the camera obscura, a drawing aid which was popular among affluent dilettantes in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.",
              "The camera obscura's beautiful but fleeting little \"light paintings\" inspired a number of people, including Thomas Wedgwood and Henry Fox Talbot, to seek some way of capturing them more easily and effectively than could be done by tracing over them with a pencil.",
              "Letters to his sister-in-law around 1816 indicate that Nie\u0301pce had managed to capture small camera images on paper coated with silver chloride,[10] making him apparently the first to have any success at all in such an attempt, but the results were negatives, dark where they should be light and vice versa, and he could find no way to stop them from darkening all over when brought into the light for viewing.",
              "Nie\u0301pce turned his attention to other substances that were affected by light, eventually concentrating on Bitumen of Judea, a naturally occurring asphalt that had been used for various purposes since ancient times.",
              "In Nie\u0301pce's time, it was used by artists as an acid-resistant coating on copper plates for making etchings.",
              "The artist scratched a drawing through the coating, then bathed the plate in acid to etch the exposed areas, then removed the coating with a solvent and used the plate to print ink copies of the drawing onto paper.",
              "What interested Nie\u0301pce was the fact that the bitumen coating became less soluble after it had been left exposed to light.",
              "Nie\u0301pce dissolved bitumen in lavender oil, a solvent often used in varnishes,[11] and thinly coated it onto a lithographic stone or a sheet of metal or glass.",
              "After the coating had dried, a test subject, typically an engraving printed on paper, was laid over the surface in close contact and the two were put out in direct sunlight.",
              "After sufficient exposure, the solvent could be used to rinse away only the unhardened bitumen that had been shielded from light by lines or dark areas in the test subject.",
              "The parts of the surface thus laid bare could then be etched with acid, or the remaining bitumen could serve as the water-repellent material in lithographic printing.",
              "Nie\u0301pce called his process heliography, which literally means \"sun drawing\".",
              "[12] In 1822, he used it to create what is believed to have been the world's first permanent photographic image,[13] a contact-exposed copy of an engraving of Pope Pius VII, but it was later destroyed when Nie\u0301pce attempted to make prints from it.",
              "[13] The earliest surviving photographic artifacts by Nie\u0301pce, made in 1825,[3] are copies of a 17th-century engraving of a man with a horse and of what may be an etching or engraving of a woman with a spinning wheel.",
              "They are simply sheets of plain paper printed with ink in a printing press, like ordinary etchings, engravings, or lithographs, but the plates used to print them were created photographically by Nie\u0301pce's process rather than by laborious and inexact hand-engraving or drawing on lithographic stones.",
              "They are, in essence, the oldest photocopies.",
              "One example of the print of the man with a horse and two examples of the print of the woman with the spinning wheel are known to have survived.",
              "The former is in the collection of the Bibliothe\u0300que nationale de France in Paris and the latter two are in a private collection in the United States.",
              "Nie\u0301pce's correspondence with his brother Claude has preserved the fact that his first real success in using bitumen to create a permanent photograph of the image in a camera obscura came in 1824.",
              "That photograph, made on the surface of a lithographic stone, was later effaced.",
              "In 1826 or 1827 he again photographed the same scene, the view from a window in his house, on a sheet of bitumen-coated pewter.",
              "The result has survived and is now the oldest known camera photograph still in existence.",
              "The historic image had seemingly been lost early in the 20th century, but photography historians Helmut and Alison Gernsheim succeeded in tracking it down in 1952.",
              "The exposure time required to make it is usually said to have been eight or nine hours, but that is a mid-20th century assumption based largely on the fact that the sun lights the buildings on opposite sides, as if from an arc across the sky, indicating an essentially day-long exposure.",
              "A later researcher who used Nie\u0301pce's notes and historically correct materials to recreate his processes found that in fact several days of exposure in the camera were needed to adequately capture such an image on a bitumen-coated plate.",
              "[14][15] In 1829,[16] Nie\u0301pce entered into a partnership with Louis Daguerre, who was also seeking a means of creating permanent photographic images with a camera.",
              "Together, they developed the physautotype, an improved process that used lavender oil distillate as the photosensitive substance.",
              "The partnership lasted until Nie\u0301pce's death in 1833, after which Daguerre continued to experiment, eventually working out a process that only superficially resembled Nie\u0301pce's.",
              "[17] He named it the \"daguerre\u0301otype\", after himself.",
              "In 1839 he managed to get the government of France to purchase his invention on behalf of the people of France.",
              "The French government agreed to award Daguerre a yearly stipend of 6,000 francs for the rest of his life, and to give the estate of Nie\u0301pce 4,000 francs yearly.",
              "This arrangement rankled Nie\u0301pce's son, who claimed Daguerre was reaping all the benefits of his father's work.",
              "In some ways, he was right\u2014for many years, Nie\u0301pce received little credit for his contribution.",
              "Later historians have reclaimed Nie\u0301pce from relative obscurity, and it is now generally recognized that his \"heliography\" was the first successful example of what we now call \"photography\":[11] the creation of a reasonably light-fast and permanent image by the action of light on a light-sensitive surface and subsequent processing.",
              "Although initially ignored amid the excitement caused by the introduction of the daguerreotype, and far too insensitive to be practical for making photographs with a camera, the utility of Nie\u0301pce's original process for its primary purpose was eventually realized.",
              "From the 1850s until well into the 20th century, a thin coating of bitumen was widely used as a slow but very effective and economical photoresist for making printing plates.",
              "The Pyre\u0301olophore, one of the world's first internal combustion engines that was actually built, was invented and patented by the Nie\u0301pce brothers in 1807.",
              "This engine ran on controlled dust explosions of lycopodium powder and was installed on a boat that ran on the river Sao\u0302ne.",
              "Ten years later, the brothers were the first in the world to make an engine work with a fuel injection system.",
              "[18] In 1807 the imperial government opened a competition for a hydraulic machine to replace the original Marly machine (located in Marly-le-Roi) that delivered water to the Palace of Versailles from the Seine river.",
              "The machine was built in Bougival in 1684, from where it pumped water a distance of one kilometer and raised it 150 meters.",
              "The Nie\u0301pce brothers conceived a new hydrostatic principle for the machine and improved it once more in 1809.",
              "The machine had undergone changes in many of its parts, including more precise pistons, creating far less resistance.",
              "They tested it many times, and the result was that with a stream drop of 4 feet 4 inches, it lifted water 11 feet.",
              "But in December 1809 they got a message that they had waited too long and the Emperor had taken on himself the decision to ask the engineer Pe\u0301rier (1742\u20131818) to build a steam engine to operate the pumps at Marly.",
              "[19] In 1818 Nie\u0301pce became interested in the ancestor of the bicycle, a Laufmaschine invented by Karl von Drais in 1817.",
              "He built himself a model and called it the ve\u0301locipe\u0300de (fast foot) and caused quite a sensation on the local country roads.",
              "Nie\u0301pce improved his machine with an adjustable saddle and it is now exhibited at the Nie\u0301pce Museum.",
              "In a letter to his brother Nice\u0301phore contemplated motorizing his machine.",
              "[20] The lunar crater Nie\u0301pce is named after him.",
              "The Nie\u0301pce Heliograph is on permanent display at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.",
              "The object was located by historians Alison and Helmut Gernsheim in 1952 and sold to the Humanities Research Center (later renamed the Harry Ransom Center) in 1963.",
              "[21] The Nie\u0301pce Prize has been awarded annually since 1955 to a professional photographer who has lived and worked in France for over 3 years.",
              "It was introduced in honour of Nie\u0301pce by Albert Ple\u0301cy of the l'Association Gens d'Images."

              "In 1816, a year before the pyreolophore patent runs out, Claude goes to Paris, then to England in 1817, trying to make work the engine invention .",
              "Nicephore starts by himself new research on an idea that has obsessed him for many years : making permanent on a support through a compound the images seen at the back of camerae obscurae .",
              "Until then , these boxes with a lens adapted on a hole , projecting on the back an inverted image of the outside view , had only been used as a drawing aid.",
              "For his first experiments , Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce positioned at the back of a camera obscura sheets of silver salts coated paper, known to blacken with daylight .",
              "In may 1816 he produced the first image of nature : a view from a window .",
              "It was a negative and the image vanished because in broad daylight the coated paper becomes completely black .",
              "He calls these images \u201cretinas\u201d.",
              "Seeking to obtain positive images, Nie\u0301pce turned towards compounds that are bleached by light instead of blackened.",
              "He then tried with salts and iron oxide, as well as manganese black oxide.",
              "Even though he got some results, he stumbled over the fixing problem, which arises when he tried eliminate the initial chemical that had not been transformed by light yet.",
              "To solve this problem, Nie\u0301pce tried to find a method that would make him obtain images etched on a base.",
              "To do this, he researched the effects of light on acids in the hope to observe their decomposition.",
              "Based on these results, he thought he could simply spread acids on calcareous stones, whose strength would vary with light intensity and etch the stone more or less, according to the hues of the image projected.",
              "However, acids are not decomposed by light, so this attempt was yet another failure.",
              "Nevertheless, it allowed Nie\u0301pce to understand that it is not necessary to use a coumpound whose photo-chemical transformation is visible to the naked eye, and that even an invisible change of chemical properties under light action may induce the appearance of an image during a reaction, either with the base or another compound.",
              "As a consequence, Nie\u0301pce got interested by all substances that interact with light.",
              "Nie\u0301pce stopped his studies on light for almost a year.",
              "Following a competion started in France, he tried to find deposits of calcareous stones for lithography (limestone).",
              "In September 1816, the two Nie\u0301pce brothers, communicating by mail, tried out a new fuel for their engine.",
              "Using kerosene, they discovered the fuel injection principle, as we know it in today\u2019s engines.",
              "In March 1817, Nie\u0301pce decidedly took up his research on making images again.",
              "While reading chemistry treatises, he focused his attention on the resin of Gai\u0308acum extracted from a coniferous tree.",
              "This yellow resin becomes green when exposed to day-light.",
              "What made it particularly interesting is that it loses its solubility in alcohol.",
              "Nie\u0301pce understood that thanks to this property it was easy to see the difference between the modified and the intact resin, thus fix the image.",
              "At first he got rather good results experimenting directly with sun-light, but failed when using a camera obscura.",
              "He did not know that only U-V rays were active on this resin and that they were filtered by his camera obscura lens.",
              "In 1818, next to fixing images, he also developed a keen interest for the dandy horse (ancestor of the bicycle without pedals) and got a lot of attention riding the roads of Saint-Loup-de-Varennes on his \u201cvelocipede\u201d.",
              "After the Gai\u0308acum resin, Nie\u0301pce used another resin, consisting of mineral: asphalt or bitumen of Judea.",
              "He demonstrated that under light action this resin became non-soluble with his usual solvent.",
              "From 1822 on, he succeeded in reproducing drawings put in contact with bitumen coated bases (glass plates, calcareous stones, then copper or tin plates).",
              "Afterwards, he used the aqua fortis process to etch the images made with acid, which were then printed on paper.",
              "This process was to remain for quite a while the base of photoengraving used to print photos and graphical documents.",
              "In order to reproduce drawings, around 1822-1823, Nie\u0301pce conceived what we now call the contact print.",
              "He explains clearly how he applied varnish to the verso of an etching to make the paper translucid, and once dry, he applied this etching directly in contact with the copper or tin plate coated with bitumen varnish.",
              "He exposed the lot in full daylight during three to four hours, then rinced the plate in lavender oil diluted with white kerosene.",
              "The bitumen that had been protected from the effect of light under the lines of the drawing then dissolved and let appear the raw metal.",
              "On the other hand, the light transmitted through the translucid paper had made the bitumen non-soluble and remained on the plate after the lavender oil rinse.",
              "The bitumen image was the drawing\u2019s negative: the back is colored in the dark bitumen brown and the lines are represented by the raw metal.",
              "Then, Nie\u0301pce invented a process that would allow to get the drawing etched in the metal.",
              "It was by means of the well known and simple principle of aqua fortis.",
              "The plate carrying the bitumen of Judea is dipped in an acid bath that bites the metal where it is not protected, meaning the places corresponding to the lines of the drawing.",
              "Because the bitumen varnish is acid resistant, the acid can penetrate down to the metal.",
              "Once the lines are etched in the plate, Nie\u0301pce eliminated the bitumen varnish from the metal base to keep only the etched drawing on it.",
              "The first successful results of this method can be dated to 1822, as far as contact reproductions are concerned, because this year Nie\u0301pce made a copy the portrait of Pope Pius VII on a glass plate.",
              "This was not yet an acid etched engraving.",
              "The earliest attempts of etching in 1823 are not on metal but on lithographic stones.",
              "A Dijon-based printer produced paper prints from those stones.",
              "Thus, Nie\u0301pce got the proof that his process \u2014 by means of contact reproduction \u2014 allowed for the multiplication of originals through printing.",
              "In 1825, he etched his images on copper, from 1826 onwards on tin.",
              "The acid process is perfectly appropriate to reproductions of line drawings, in which gradations are represented by hatchings.",
              "In the case of images with continuous tones, these are reproduced by various thicknesses of bitumen that acid etching cannot render, as the acid solution cannot permeate the varnish.",
              "Nie\u0301pce understood this phenomenon and worked continuously to reproduce etchings.",
              "Many museums throughout the world preserve metal plates etched by the inventor with this process.",
              "The Nie\u0301pce Museum owns ten of those metal plates on which Nice\u0301phore reproduced engravings.",
              "Other Nie\u0301pce etched metal plates are preserved at \u201cLa Societe franc\u0327aise de Photographie\u201d, at \u201cThe Royal Photographic Society\u201d or in Janine Nie\u0301pce\u2019s collection.",
              "Yet, after his numerous failures to etch continuous tones images obtained with a camera obscura, Nie\u0301pce gradually gave up acid etching and stopped completely after July 1827.",
              "In 1824, he put lithographic stones, coated with bitumen, at the back of a camera obscura and obtained for the first time ever a fixed image of a landscape.",
              "This required an extremely long exposure time, in broad daylight, for a few days.",
              "Starting in 1825, he regularly used copper as a base, then tin in 1826, while also realising etched images.",
              "In 1827, Nie\u0301pce went to England, where he found his brother dying, without any improvements to the engine at hand.",

              "The First Photographer When posed with the question as to who it was who actually took the very first photograph, there is little argument today that it was Joseph Nicephor Nie\u0301pce.",
              "Nie\u0301pce was born in France on March 7, 1765.",
              "He was one of three children with a father who was a wealthy attorney.",
              "The family was forced to flee the area when the French revolution began.",
              "Nie\u0301pce was named Joseph, but while studying at the Oratorian College in Angers, he decided to adopt the name Nice\u0301phore in honor of Saint Nicephorus the ninth-century Patriarch of Constantinople.",
              "His studies taught him experimental methods in science and he graduated to become a professor at the college.",
              "Nie\u0301pce served as a staff officer in the French army under Napoleon.",
              "During his years in the service, the majority of his time was spent in Italy and on the island of Sardinia.",
              "He resigned his post due to illness.",
              "After leaving the service he married Agnes Romero and became Administrator of the district of Nice.",
              "He left this position to further pursue scientific research with his older brother Claude at their families estate in Chalon.",
              "He was reunited at the family home with his mom, sister and younger brother Bernard.",
              "Not only did he pursue his scientific research, but he also managed the family estate.",
              "The brothers served as wealthy gentlemen-farmers, raising beets and producing sugar.",
              "Nie\u0301pce is believed to have taken the world\u2019s first photographic etching in 1822.",
              "Using a camera obscura, a box with a hole in one side which utilizes light from an external scene, he took an engraving of Pope Pius VII.",
              "This image was later destroyed by the scientist when he attempted to duplicate it.",
              "Two of his attempts did however survive.",
              "One was a man and his horse, and the other a woman sitting at a spinning wheel.",
              "Nie\u0301pce\u2019s main problem was an unsteady hand and weak drawing skills, which led him to attempt to find a way to capture images permanently without relying on his poor drawing skills.",
              "Nie\u0301pce experimented with the use of silver chloride, which darkened when exposed to light, but found it was not sufficient to produce the results he desired.",
              "He then moved on to bitumen, which led him to his first successful attempt at capturing a nature image.",
              "His process involved dissolving bitumen in lavender oil, which is a solvent often used in varnish.",
              "He then coated a sheet of pewter with this mixture and placed it inside a camera obscura.",
              "Eight hours later he removed it and washed it with lavender oil to remove any unexposed bitumen.",
              "The picture itself was not very memorable as it was a building, a barn, and a tree.",
              "It was believed to be the courtyard outside his house.",
              "However, since the process was such a slow one, taking over 8 hours, the sun moved from one side of the image to the other making it appear as if the sun was coming from two sides of the photo.",
              "This process would later inspire Louis Daguerre\u2019s highly successful mercury vapor development process.",
              "It had taken him over twenty years of experimenting with optical images before he had this success.",
              "The earlier problem had been that although he was able to set optical images, they would fade quickly.",
              "The earliest surviving photo from Nie\u0301pce is from 1825.",
              "He named his new process a Heliograph, after the Greek word for \u201cof the sun.",
              "\u201d Once Nie\u0301pce had the success he desired he decided to travel to England to try to promote his new invention to the Royal Society.",
              "Unfortunately, he was met with total failure.",
              "The Society has a rule stating that it would not promote any discovery with an undisclosed secret.",
              "Certainly, Nie\u0301pce was not prepared to share his secrets with the world, so he returned to France disappointed that he was unable to make a success of his new invention.",
              "In France, Nie\u0301pce formed an alliance with Louis Daguerre.",
              "In 1829 they began collaborating to improve the process.",
              "They remained partners for the next four years until Nie\u0301pce\u2019s death from a stroke in 1833 at the age of 69.",
              "Daguerre continued working on the process after Nie\u0301pce\u2019s death eventually developing a process that, although based on their original findings, was much different than what Nie\u0301pce had created.",
              "He named it the Daguerreotype, after himself.",
              "He managed to get the government of France to purchase his invention on behalf of the people of France.",
              "In 1939 the French government agreed to pay Daguerre a yearly stipend of 6,000 Francs for the rest of his life, and to pay the estate of Nie\u0301pce 4,000 Francs yearly.",
              "Nie\u0301pce\u2019s son was not happy with this arrangement, claiming that Daguerre was receiving benefits for what his father had created.",
              "Nie\u0301pce actually received little credit for anything to do with this creation until 1952 when historians Alison and Helmut Gernsheim rediscovered Nie\u0301pce\u2019s original images.",
              "It was this discovery that allowed the world to learn about Nie\u0301pce\u2019s \"heliographic\" process and allow the world to realize that this was the first successful example of what we now call photography: an image created on a light-sensitive surface, by the action of light.",
              "Although Nie\u0301pce is most noted for his invention in the photographic area, he also had several previous successes as an inventor.",
              "Among Nie\u0301pce's other inventions was the Pyreolophore, the world\u2019s first internal combustion engine, which he conceived and created with his brother Claude.",
              "Emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte, granted his patent in 1807 after he was shown its ability to power a boat upstream on a river in France.",
              "In honor of this photographer, The Nie\u0301pce Prize Nie\u0301pce was created and has been awarded annually since 1955 to a professional photographer who has lived and worked in France for over 3 years.",

              "The son of a wealthy family suspected of royalist sympathies, Nie\u0301pce fled the French Revolution but returned to serve in the French army under Napoleon Bonaparte.",
              "Dismissed because of ill health, he settled near his native town of Chalon-sur-Sao\u0302ne, where he remained engaged in research for the rest of his life.",
              "In 1807 Nie\u0301pce and his brother Claude invented an internal-combustion engine, which they called the Pyre\u0301olophore, explaining that the word was derived from a combination of the Greek words for \u201cfire,\u201d \u201cwind,\u201d and \u201cI produce.",
              "\u201d Working on a piston-and-cylinder system similar to 20th-century gasoline-powered engines, the Pyre\u0301olophore initially used lycopodium powder for fuel, and Nie\u0301pce claimed to have used it to power a boat.",
              "When lithography became a fashionable hobby in France in 1813, Nie\u0301pce began to experiment with the then-novel printing technique.",
              "Unskilled in drawing, and unable to obtain proper lithographic stone locally, he sought a way to provide images automatically.",
              "He coated pewter with various light-sensitive substances in an effort to copy superimposed engravings in sunlight.",
              "From this he progressed in April 1816 to attempts at photography, which he called heliography (sundrawing), with a camera.",
              "He recorded a view from his workroom window on paper sensitized with silver chloride but was only partially able to fix the image.",
              "Next he tried various types of supports for the light-sensitive material bitumen of Judea, a kind of asphalt, which hardens on exposure to light.",
              "Using this material he succeeded in 1822 in obtaining a photographic copy of an engraving superimposed on glass.",
              "In 1826/27, using a camera, he made a view from his workroom on a pewter plate, this being the first permanently fixed image from nature.",
              "Metal had the advantage of being unbreakable and was better suited to the subsequent etching process to produce a printing plate, which was Nie\u0301pce\u2019s final aim.",
              "In 1826, he had produced another heliograph, a reproduction of an engraved portrait, which was etched by the Parisian engraver Augustin-Franc\u0327ois Lemai\u0302tre, who pulled two prints.",
              "Thus Nie\u0301pce not only solved the problem of reproducing nature by light, but he invented the first photomechanical reproduction process.",
              "While on a visit to England in 1827, Nie\u0301pce addressed a memorandum on his invention to the Royal Society, London, but his insistence on keeping the method secret prevented the matter from being investigated.",
              "Unable to reduce the very long exposure times by either chemical or optical means, Nie\u0301pce in 1829 finally gave in to the repeated overtures of Louis-Jacques-Mande\u0301 Daguerre, a Parisian painter, for a partnership to perfect and exploit heliography.",
              "Nie\u0301pce died without seeing any further advance, but, building on his knowledge, and working with his materials, Daguerre eventually succeeded in greatly reducing the exposure time through his discovery of a chemical process for development of (making visible) the latent (invisible) image formed upon brief exposure.",
              "These experiments eventually led him to invent the daguerreotype, the first successful form of photography."

              "Nicephore starts by himself new research on an idea that has obsessed him for many years : making permanent on a support through a compound the images seen at the back of camerae obscurae .",
              "Until then , these boxes with a lens adapted on a hole , projecting on the back an inverted image of the outside view , had only been used as a drawing aid.",
              "For his first experiments , Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce positioned at the back of a camera obscura sheets of silver salts coated paper, known to blacken with daylight .",
              "In may 1816 he produced the first image of nature : a view from a window .",

              "Seeking to obtain positive images, Nie\u0301pce turned towards compounds that are bleached by light instead of blackened.",

              "Even though he got some results, he stumbled over the fixing problem, which arises when he tried eliminate the initial chemical that had not been transformed by light yet.",
              "To solve this problem, Nie\u0301pce tried to find a method that would make him obtain images etched on a base.",
              "To do this, he researched the effects of light on acids in the hope to observe their decomposition.",
              "Based on these results, he thought he could simply spread acids on calcareous stones, whose strength would vary with light intensity and etch the stone more or less, according to the hues of the image projected.",
              "However, acids are not decomposed by light, so this attempt was yet another failure.",
              "Nevertheless, it allowed Nie\u0301pce to understand that it is not necessary to use a coumpound whose photo-chemical transformation is visible to the naked eye, and that even an invisible change of chemical properties under light action may induce the appearance of an image during a reaction, either with the base or another compound.",
              "As a consequence, Nie\u0301pce got interested by all substances that interact with light.",
              "Nie\u0301pce stopped his studies on light for almost a year.",
              "Following a competion started in France, he tried to find deposits of calcareous stones for lithography (limestone).",
              "In September 1816, the two Nie\u0301pce brothers, communicating by mail, tried out a new fuel for their engine.",
              "Using kerosene, they discovered the fuel injection principle, as we know it in today\u2019s engines.",
              "In March 1817, Nie\u0301pce decidedly took up his research on making images again.",
              "While reading chemistry treatises, he focused his attention on the resin of Gai\u0308acum extracted from a coniferous tree.",
              "This yellow resin becomes green when exposed to day-light.",
              "What made it particularly interesting is that it loses its solubility in alcohol.",
              "Nie\u0301pce understood that thanks to this property it was easy to see the difference between the modified and the intact resin, thus fix the image.",
              "At first he got rather good results experimenting directly with sun-light, but failed when using a camera obscura.",
              "He did not know that only U-V rays were active on this resin and that they were filtered by his camera obscura lens.",
              "In 1818, next to fixing images, he also developed a keen interest for the dandy horse (ancestor of the bicycle without pedals) and got a lot of attention riding the roads of Saint-Loup-de-Varennes on his \u201cvelocipede\u201d.",
              "After the Gai\u0308acum resin, Nie\u0301pce used another resin, consisting of mineral: asphalt or bitumen of Judea.",
              "He demonstrated that under light action this resin became non-soluble with his usual solvent.",
              "From 1822 on, he succeeded in reproducing drawings put in contact with bitumen coated bases (glass plates, calcareous stones, then copper or tin plates).",
              "Afterwards, he used the aqua fortis process to etch the images made with acid, which were then printed on paper.",
              "This process was to remain for quite a while the base of photoengraving used to print photos and graphical documents.",
              "In order to reproduce drawings, around 1822-1823, Nie\u0301pce conceived what we now call the contact print.",
              "He explains clearly how he applied varnish to the verso of an etching to make the paper translucid, and once dry, he applied this etching directly in contact with the copper or tin plate coated with bitumen varnish.",
              "He exposed the lot in full daylight during three to four hours, then rinced the plate in lavender oil diluted with white kerosene.",
              "The bitumen that had been protected from the effect of light under the lines of the drawing then dissolved and let appear the raw metal.",
              "On the other hand, the light transmitted through the translucid paper had made the bitumen non-soluble and remained on the plate after the lavender oil rinse.",
              "The bitumen image was the drawing\u2019s negative: the back is colored in the dark bitumen brown and the lines are represented by the raw metal.",
              "Then, Nie\u0301pce invented a process that would allow to get the drawing etched in the metal.",
              "It was by means of the well known and simple principle of aqua fortis.",
              "The plate carrying the bitumen of Judea is dipped in an acid bath that bites the metal where it is not protected, meaning the places corresponding to the lines of the drawing.",
              "Because the bitumen varnish is acid resistant, the acid can penetrate down to the metal.",
              "Once the lines are etched in the plate, Nie\u0301pce eliminated the bitumen varnish from the metal base to keep only the etched drawing on it.",
              "The first successful results of this method can be dated to 1822, as far as contact reproductions are concerned, because this year Nie\u0301pce made a copy the portrait of Pope Pius VII on a glass plate.",
              "This was not yet an acid etched engraving.",
              "The earliest attempts of etching in 1823 are not on metal but on lithographic stones.",
              "A Dijon-based printer produced paper prints from those stones.",
              "Thus, Nie\u0301pce got the proof that his process \u2014 by means of contact reproduction \u2014 allowed for the multiplication of originals through printing.",
              "In 1825, he etched his images on copper, from 1826 onwards on tin.",
              "The acid process is perfectly appropriate to reproductions of line drawings, in which gradations are represented by hatchings.",
              "In the case of images with continuous tones, these are reproduced by various thicknesses of bitumen that acid etching cannot render, as the acid solution cannot permeate the varnish.",
              "Nie\u0301pce understood this phenomenon and worked continuously to reproduce etchings.",
              "Many museums throughout the world preserve metal plates etched by the inventor with this process.",

              "This development was in fact such an amplification of the effect of light that the exposure time was hardly more than 30 minutes.",
              "Fixing was done by immersing the plate in sea salted water.",

              "A sheet of paper covered with silver chloride was blackened by light, then exposed in a camera obscura after having been sensitized in silver iodide.",
              "The exposure time was from 30 minutes to 2 hours.",
              "Still in 1839 , the announcement of the daguerreotype invention incited an Englishman, William Henry Fox Talbot, to resume interrupted research, the beginning of which was in 1834.",

              "The black and white images obtained with this process reached a quality unknown until then.",
              "The only drawbacks were that the picture had to be taken while the collodion on the plate was still humid and the developement had to happen immediatly after the exposure.",
              "In 1871, another Englishman, Richard Meaddox, resolved this problem by replacing collodion by gelatin, a process perfected by Charles Bennet, who demonstrated that gelatinized plates acquired a high sensitivity when they were kept for a few days at 32\u00b0 Celsius.",
              "Not only could the gelatino-bromide plates be stored before use, but their sensitivity was such that the exposure time could not exceed a fraction of a second.",
              "The story of the shutter started shortly before 1880, because the high sensitivity of these plates made it necessary to conceive mecanisms able to let light enter the camera for 1/100th and even 1/1000th of a second.",

              "The details were introduced to the world in 1839, a date generally accepted as the birth year of practical photography.",
              "[2][3] The metal-based daguerreotype process soon had some competition from the paper-based calotype negative and salt print processes invented by William Henry Fox Talbot and demonstrated in 1839 soon after news about the daguerreotype reached Talbot.",

              "[15] The early science fiction novel Giphantie[16] (1760) by the Frenchman Tiphaigne de la Roche described something quite similar to (color) photography, a process that fixes fleeting images formed by rays of light: \"They coat a piece of canvas with this material, and place it in front of the object to capture.",

              "[2] It was made on a polished sheet of pewter and the light-sensitive substance was a thin coating of bitumen, a naturally occurring petroleum tar, which was dissolved in lavender oil, applied to the surface of the pewter and allowed to dry before use.",
              "[27] After a very long exposure in the camera (traditionally said to be eight hours, but now believed to be several days),[28] the bitumen was sufficiently hardened in proportion to its exposure to light that the unhardened part could be removed with a solvent, leaving a positive image with the light areas represented by hardened bitumen and the dark areas by bare pewter.",
              "[27] To see the image plainly, the plate had to be lit and viewed in such a way that the bare metal appeared dark and the bitumen relatively light.",
              "[26] In partnership, Nie\u0301pce in Chalon-sur-Sao\u0302ne and Louis Daguerre in Paris refined the bitumen process,[29] substituting a more sensitive resin and a very different post-exposure treatment that yielded higher-quality and more easily viewed images.",
              "Exposure times in the camera, although substantially reduced, were still measured in hours.",
              "[26] Nie\u0301pce died suddenly in 1833, leaving his notes to Daguerre.",
              "More interested in silver-based processes than Nie\u0301pce had been, Daguerre experimented with photographing camera images directly onto a mirror-like silver-surfaced plate that had been fumed with iodine vapor, which reacted with the silver to form a coating of silver iodide.",
              "As with the bitumen process, the result appeared as a positive when it was suitably lit and viewed.",
              "Exposure times were still impractically long until Daguerre made the pivotal discovery that an invisibly slight or \"latent\" image produced on such a plate by a much shorter exposure could be \"developed\" to full visibility by mercury fumes.",
              "This brought the required exposure time down to a few minutes under optimum conditions.",
              "A strong hot solution of common salt served to stabilize or fix the image by removing the remaining silver iodide.",
              "On 7 January 1839, this first complete practical photographic process was announced at a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences,[30] and the news quickly spread.",
              "[31] At first, all details of the process were withheld and specimens were shown only at Daguerre's studio, under his close supervision, to Academy members and other distinguished guests.",

              "[33] Complete instructions were made public on 19 August 1839.",
              "[34] Known as the daguerreotype process, it was the most common commercial process until the late 1850s when it was superseded by the collodion process.",

              "Henry Fox Talbot had already succeeded in creating stabilized photographic negatives on paper in 1835, but worked on perfecting his own process after reading early reports of Daguerre's invention.",
              "In early 1839, he acquired a key improvement, an effective fixer, from his friend John Herschel, a polymath scientist who had previously shown that hyposulfite of soda (commonly called \"hypo\" and now known formally as sodium thiosulfate) would dissolve silver salts.",
              "[37] News of this solvent also benefited Daguerre, who soon adopted it as a more efficient alternative to his original hot salt water method.",
              "[38] Talbot's early silver chloride \"sensitive paper\" experiments required camera exposures of an hour or more.",
              "In 1841, Talbot invented the calotype process, which, like Daguerre's process, used the principle of chemical development of a faint or invisible \"latent\" image to reduce the exposure time to a few minutes.",
              "Paper with a coating of silver iodide was exposed in the camera and developed into a translucent negative image.",
              "Unlike a daguerreotype, which could only be copied by photographing it with a camera, a calotype negative could be used to make a large number of positive prints by simple contact printing.",
              "The calotype had yet another distinction compared to other early photographic processes, in that the finished product lacked fine clarity due to its translucent paper negative.",
              "This was seen as a positive attribute for portraits because it softened the appearance of the human face[citation needed].",
              "Talbot patented this process,[39] which greatly limited its adoption, and spent many years pressing lawsuits against alleged infringers.",
              "He attempted to enforce a very broad interpretation of his patent, earning himself the ill will of photographers who were using the related glass-based processes later introduced by other inventors, but he was eventually defeated.",

              "[55] It was based on one of Louis Duclos du Haroun's ideas: instead of taking three separate photographs through color filters, take one through a mosaic of tiny color filters overlaid on the emulsion and view the results through an identical mosaic.",
              "If the individual filter elements were small enough, the three primary colors of red, blue, and green would blend together in the eye and produce the same additive color synthesis as the filtered projection of three separate photographs.",

              "Then through the use of a rolling press, five tons of pressure were used to flatten the grains, enabling every one of them to capture and absorb color and their microscopic size allowing the illusion that the colors are merged.",

              "An indoor portrait required several minutes with the subject stationary.",
              "This was because the grains absorbed color fairly slowly, and a filter of a yellowish-orange color was required to keep the photograph from coming out excessively blue.",
              "Although necessary, the filter had the effect of reducing the amount of light that was absorbed.",
              "Another drawback was that the image could only be enlarged so much before the many dots that made up the image would become apparent.",

              "When lithography became a fashionable hobby in France in 1813, Nie\u0301pce began to experiment with the then-novel printing technique.",
              "Unskilled in drawing, and unable to obtain proper lithographic stone locally, he sought a way to provide images automatically.",
              "He coated pewter with various light-sensitive substances in an effort to copy superimposed engravings in sunlight.",
              "From this he progressed in April 1816 to attempts at photography, which he called heliography (sundrawing), with a camera.",
              "He recorded a view from his workroom window on paper sensitized with silver chloride but was only partially able to fix the image.",
              "Next he tried various types of supports for the light-sensitive material bitumen of Judea, a kind of asphalt, which hardens on exposure to light.",
              "Using this material he succeeded in 1822 in obtaining a photographic copy of an engraving superimposed on glass.",
              "In 1826/27, using a camera, he made a view from his workroom on a pewter plate, this being the first permanently fixed image from nature.",
              "Metal had the advantage of being unbreakable and was better suited to the subsequent etching process to produce a printing plate, which was Nie\u0301pce\u2019s final aim.",
              "In 1826, he had produced another heliograph, a reproduction of an engraved portrait, which was etched by the Parisian engraver Augustin-Franc\u0327ois Lemai\u0302tre, who pulled two prints.",
              "Thus Nie\u0301pce not only solved the problem of reproducing nature by light, but he invented the first photomechanical reproduction process.",
              "While on a visit to England in 1827, Nie\u0301pce addressed a memorandum on his invention to the Royal Society, London, but his insistence on keeping the method secret prevented the matter from being investigated.",
              "Unable to reduce the very long exposure times by either chemical or optical means, Nie\u0301pce in 1829 finally gave in to the repeated overtures of Louis-Jacques-Mande\u0301 Daguerre, a Parisian painter, for a partnership to perfect and exploit heliography.",
              "Nie\u0301pce died without seeing any further advance, but, building on his knowledge, and working with his materials, Daguerre eventually succeeded in greatly reducing the exposure time through his discovery of a chemical process for development of (making visible) the latent (invisible) image formed upon brief exposure.",
              "These experiments eventually led him to invent the daguerreotype, the first successful form of photography."

              "Practiced by amateurs and professionals (male and female alike), the new form of picture making combined art and science, optics and chemistry, and handcraft and industry in unexpected and unprecedented ways.",
              "Like the railroad and the telegraph, photography was a modern technological innovation, a product of the Industrial Revolution.",
              "But it also had an aura of wonder and mystery: the chemical activity that made an amazingly detailed image appear on a metal plate or a piece of paper seemed almost magical.",
              "How could silver and sunlight alone produce such \u201cdivine perfection,\u201d as one critic described it?",
              "The optical basis for photography is relatively simple.",
              "Since ancient times people have observed that light passing through a small hole or lens into a darkened room projects an upside-down image on the opposite wall, just as it does on the retina of the eye.",
              "By the 17th century this phenomenon became the basis of a portable artist\u2019s tool known as the camera obscura (Latin for \u201cdark room\u201d).",
              "A wooden box was fitted with a lens for gathering light and sharpening the image, which was reflected onto frosted glass on top of the box and traced by an artist.",
              "The camera lucida, or \u201clight room,\u201d was a related apparatus\u2014a multisided prism mounted on a vertical rod attached to a drawing board.",
              "When an artist peered through the prism, the image appeared to be projected on the paper, where it could be traced.",
              "Such mechanical aids were no substitute for artistic skill.",
              "William Henry Fox Talbot, an English gentleman-scholar vacationing near Lake Como in Italy in 1833, attempted to use a camera lucida to draw the scenery but met with little success.",
              "As he later recalled, \u201cWhen the eye was removed from the prism\u2014in which all looked beautiful\u2014I found that the faithless pencil had only left traces on the paper melancholy to behold.",
              "\u201d He mused, \u201cHow charming it would be if it were possible to cause these natural images to imprint themselves durably, and remain fixed upon the paper!",
              "\u201d Chemistry, it seemed, could provide an answer to this dilemma.",
              "Scholars had known for centuries that certain compounds, most notably natural silver salts, darkened when exposed to the sun.",
              "In the 1720s German physicist and medical professor Johann Heinrich Schulze baked silver nitrate in an oven to show that light, not heat, caused this discoloration.",
              "Schulze also put stencils of texts on glass jars filled with a mixture of chalk and silver nitrate.",
              "As he explained, \u201cThe sun\u2019s rays, where they hit the glass through the cut-out parts of the paper, wrote each word or sentence on the chalk precipitate so exactly and distinctly that many who were curious about the experiment but ignorant of its nature took occasion to attribute the thing to some sort of trick.",
              "\u201d As the study of chemistry developed throughout the 18th century, more pieces of the puzzle came together.",
              "Swedish pharmaceutical chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, now well-known as one of the codiscoverers of oxygen, examined the properties of silver chloride in the 1770s, recognizing that the reaction taking place in sunlight was a reduction to metallic silver.",
              "He also noted that ammonia stabilized darkened silver chloride\u2014an important step toward solving the problem of \u201cfixing\u201d the camera-obscura image.",
              "At roughly the same time, Jean Senebier, a Swiss pastor and botanist, experimented widely with the effects of light on living plants, plant products, and other materials.",
              "One of these substances was fused silver chloride, called lune corne\u0301e, or horn silver.",
              "Senebier found that focusing sunlight through a lens sped up the darkening reaction, while filtering it through various materials slowed it down, and that different colored rays of the spectrum worked at different rates.",
              "Schulze had made silver nitrate \u201cwrite\u201d messages, but decades passed before anyone tried to create an actual picture using light-sensitive chemicals.",
              "The English physicist Thomas Wedgwood of the famed ceramics family and the rising young chemist Humphry Davy moved in the same advanced scientific circles.",
              "Wedgwood experimented with silver nitrate in the 1790s and perhaps even earlier;",
              "Davy published his friend\u2019s results in 1802, adding some of his own observations.",
              "As he reported, the first attempts with a camera obscura failed, for the images were too faint to affect the silver nitrate.",
              "The two then took another approach, covering a white surface with the compound and placing it behind a painting on glass.",
              "Sunlight passing through the glass produced \u201cdistinct tints of brown or black, sensibly differing in intensity according to the shades of the picture, and where the light is unaltered, the colour of the nitrate becomes deepest.",
              "\u201d Such contact printing of pictures or silhouettes on treated leather or paper was, however, only partially successful.",
              "Though an image did form, Wedgwood and Davy were unable to arrest the process, and the surface soon turned dark all over.",
              "Varnishing the picture did not help, nor did \u201crepeated washings.",
              "\u201d Davy concluded with the hope that further chemical experimentation could make the image permanent, but it would be another quarter-century before this dream was realized.",
              "In 1807 Frenchman Joseph Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce, a modest amateur scientist and inventor from an old aristocratic family, devised an early combustion engine called the Pyre\u0301olophore with his brother Claude.",
              "Around 1816 Nie\u0301pce began experimenting with printmaking techniques, and by the 1820s he was creating reproductions of prints with a contact printing process he called heliography, or sun writing.",
              "Through trial and error Nie\u0301pce determined that bitumen of Judea, a resinous substance that hardened upon exposure to light, worked best: the bitumen not affected by light was washed away with oil of lavender, and the metal thus exposed was then etched to form a new printing plate.",
              "He also used this bitumen on pewter plates, sensitized with iodine gas, to take images using a camera obscura.",
              "The world\u2019s first surviving photograph, an indistinct eight-hour exposure of the view from the window of Nie\u0301pce\u2019s attic workroom, is a heliograph from 1826.",
              "Nie\u0301pce soon acquired an unlikely collaborator.",
              "Louis-Jacques-Mande\u0301 Daguerre, born near Paris, was a theatrical artist and relentless self-promoter.",
              "In the 1820s he had devised the Diorama, a popular form of entertainment in which the scenery itself became the show.",
              "With clever lighting, large-scale backdrops painted on semitransparent gauze seemed to merge into each other, presenting a convincing illusion of day changing into night or of people moving through the scene.",
              "Familiar with the camera obscura from his work on these perspective paintings, Daguerre also dreamed of capturing the fleeting images within the box.",
              "Like some previous experimenters, he used silver chloride but didn\u2019t have much to show for it.",
              "He often visited the Paris shop of Vincent and Charles Chevalier, father and son instrument makers and opticians, to examine new apparatus and lenses.",
              "Here, in 1826, he first learned of Nie\u0301pce, whom the Chevaliers also supplied with optical instruments.",
              "Ever the enthusiast, Daguerre wrote Nie\u0301pce to ask how far his work had progressed, announcing that \u201cfor a long time, I, too, have been seeking the impossible.",
              "\u201d Startled by this bold approach from a total stranger, Nie\u0301pce remained wary for some time.",
              "In 1829, however, after prolonged negotiations, the two men entered into a partnership, agreeing to share any profits from the new invention once it had been perfected.",
              "Nie\u0301pce supplied most of the knowledge;",
              "Daguerre provided energy and imagination.",
              "The two met only once but corresponded frequently, sharing research results.",
              "They were experimenting with silver-coated plates treated with iodine when Nie\u0301pce died of a sudden stroke in July 1833 at age 69.",
              "Daguerre continued the work, painstakingly trying different lenses, chemicals, and processes to improve and fix the heliographic image.",
              "From Nie\u0301pce\u2019s research Daguerre knew that exposure to light sometimes created a latent image: one that did not become visible until treated with more chemicals.",
              "Sometime in 1835 he discovered that mercury vapor made this latent image appear strongly on a copper plate coated with a thin silver layer, but it took him two more years to fix such images permanently with a salt solution.",
              "Despite its permanence, the resulting picture had drawbacks.",
              "It required a long exposure (several minutes or more), had a fragile surface (needing to be covered with glass and encased), lacked color, and was difficult to see except at certain angles.",
              "The image, however, had a remarkable richness of tone and was incredibly sharp and detailed.",
              "A magnifying glass revealed wonders that an artist\u2019s pencil could never capture.",
              "Daguerre, building on Nie\u0301pce\u2019s work, had finally created a practical picture-making technique, which he named after himself\u2014much to the surprise of Nie\u0301pce\u2019s son and heir, Isidore.",
              "Daguerre planned to profit from the daguerreotype, but events soon took a different turn, thanks to an unusual man.",
              "Franc\u0327ois-Jean-Dominique Arago began his career as a geographical surveyor but then became involved in scientific studies of magnetism and light.",
              "Elected to the Acade\u0301mie des Sciences at the young age of 23, Arago brought his scientific interests into politics when in 1830 he became a member of France\u2019s main legislative body, the Chambre des De\u0301pute\u0301s.",
              "When Daguerre approached a group of prominent scientists in late 1838, seeking subscribers for his invention, Arago quickly realized the potential of the new technique.",
              "Such an important innovation, he believed, should not remain in the hands of a few individuals.",
              "Instead, Arago planned to persuade the French government to buy the invention from Daguerre and Isidore Nie\u0301pce, thus making it available to the world.",
              "He began his campaign with an announcement to the Acade\u0301mie des Sciences in January 1839, praising the \u201cplates on which the [camera obscura] image is reproduced down to the most minute details with unbelievable exactitude and finesse.",
              "\u201d News of the miraculous pictures spread rapidly, and several people came forward to announce that they had independently developed similar techniques.",

              "Placing lace or botanical specimens against the paper, he exposed it to the sun.",

              "Using tiny cameras with large lenses nicknamed \u201cmouse traps,\u201d he succeeded in capturing miniature, negative images of parts of his house.",
              "Talbot had abandoned these researches, thinking to perfect them at a later date, but the news of Daguerre\u2019s invention galvanized him.",
              "He sent specimens of his work to the Royal Institution in London, wrote to Arago and other French scientists, and had papers read at the Royal Academy describing his process.",
              "By early February 1839 Talbot was corresponding with a friend, noted astronomer Sir John Herschel, who had just begun his own work with camera-obscura images.",
              "Herschel coined the term photography, meaning \u201cwriting with light,\u201d for the new process.",
              "His other major contribution was an improved fixing method, immediately adopted by both Talbot and Daguerre.",

              "\u201d That compound is now known as sodium thiosulfate, widely called \u201chypo,\u201d which was used as a fixing agent for many years.",
              "By the fall of 1840 Talbot had devised a successful negative-positive paper process, which he dubbed calotype, from the Greek and Latin words for \u201cbeautiful image.",
              "\u201d Meanwhile, back in Paris, Arago used his political and scientific influence to press forward with the purchase of Daguerre and Nie\u0301pce\u2019s process.",
              "A fire in March 1839 destroyed the Diorama, Daguerre\u2019s main source of income, and provided a further justification for a financial reward.",
              "On or around 1 August, a bill proposing pensions for Daguerre and Isidore Nie\u0301pce passed into law.",
              "The details of the method, however, remained secret until 19 August, when all was revealed to the overflow crowd at the momentous meeting at the Institut de France.",
              "Marc-Antoine Gaudin, a partner in an optical instrument-making firm, was present that day.",

              "Nie\u0301pce died without seeing any further advance, but, building on his knowledge, and working with his materials, Daguerre eventually succeeded in greatly reducing the exposure time through his discovery of a chemical process for development of (making visible) the latent (invisible) image formed upon brief exposure.",

              "Georges Poitonnie\u0301e asserts, based on the Nie\u0301pce brothers correspondence, that the first such image was produced as early as 1822.",
              "[12][13] The process used was low in sensistivity;",

              "In this regard it was not unlike the daguerreotype which itself was based on Nie\u0301pce's discoveries taken up by Daguerre who in 1826 had heard through the Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier that Nie\u0301pce, who purchased sophisticated lenses from them, had been using bitumen of Judea to print images on pewter.",
              "By then, Nie\u0301pce had begun using iodine vapors to darken the light parts of camera images produced on silver plates, rendering a positive image.",
              "Daguerre and Nie\u0301pce corresponded, each hesitant to divulge the extent of his progress to the other.",
              "After both felt they could develop their work more quickly in collaboration, they formed a company on 14 December 1829.",
              "Daguerre preferred the \u201cnegative\u201d image obtained on bitumen, and together they invented a new process that rendered a single, unique image, the physautotype,[17] which exploited the photosensitivity of the residue from oil of lavender dissolved in alcohol, resulting in an image that, like the daguerreotype, appeared either positive or negative depending on the angle of reflected light.",
              "Daguerre continued to perfect the process to render a unique image using iodine, not to intensify the image, but because of its photosensitivity when applied to silver plates as a vapor.",
              "This led Daguerre to the daguerreotype process, in which mercury fumes brought out the latent image in the silver iodide on plates exposed to light in a camera.",
              "Daguerre probably produced his first successful daguerreotypes as early as 1834 and after Nie\u0301pce\u2019s death entered a new partnership with Nie\u0301pce\u2019s son, Isidore on 9 May 1835, changing the name from \u201cNie\u0301pce-Daguerre\u201d to \u201cDaguerre and Isidore Nie\u0301pce.",

              "its hardening in proportion to its exposure to light is understood to be due to further cross-linking of the rings, as is the hardening of tree resins (colophony, or abietic acid) by light, first noted by Jean Senebier in 1782.",
              "The photochemistry of these processes, which has been studied by Jean-Louis Marignier of Universite\u0301 Paris-Sud since the 1990s,[18][19][20] is still to be fully understood.",

              "The way in which he presented Nie\u0301pce\u2019s method was done in terms so negative that nobody accorded any importance to asphalt-based heliography.",
              "Everybody was infatuated with the daguerreotype, a technique that made the portrait available to everyone.",
              "Nevertheless, although the daguerreotype was universally praised, it was reproached for being a technique that produced a single image.",
              "Certain people tried to transform the daguerreotype into an engraved plate that could be used for making printed reproductions of the image.",
              "A number of techniques were developed, but they were never applied on any extensive scale since they were very complicated and unreliable.",
              "When the daguerreotype was replaced by Talbot\u2019s calotype, it was believed that this technique could easily be used to illustrate books.",
              "The images were obtained on paper and by simply making copies from the negative by contact printing.",
              "There was no need for intermediate optical procedures.",
              "The method used by Talbot and by Blanquart-Evrard consisted of hand gluing the photographs into the books.",
              "It was slow work and what is worse, the photographs aged badly and slowly deteriorated.",
              "It became clear that a way to print photographs permanently had to be found.",
              "It was at that point that Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce\u2019s technique for obtaining engraved plates was resuscitated.",
              "There was an attempt to use it to reproduce not only drawings but photographs on translucent paper or on glass.",

              "The various techniques developed after Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce\u2019s death resolved the problem in one fashion or another.",
              "In what follows, we will limit ourselves to citing only the principal photomechanical methods developed after his death that used asphalt as photosensitive product.",
              "We will intentionally not touch upon those procedures that use the same principle as Nie\u0301pce\u2019s but depend on the use of bichromate colloids (albumin, gelatine gum).",
              ".",
              "After Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce, the second application using asphalt for making photogravures dates from 3 July 1852 when Barreswill, Davanne, Lemercier and Lerebours obtained a patent for \u201can application of photography to lithography and, by extension, to zincography and even to engraving\u201d.",
              "This technique is rather similar to Nie\u0301pee\u2019s early work in 1824.",
              "However, the powdered asphalt is dissolved in an ether solution that was much more diluted than Nie\u0301pce\u2019s.",
              "The layer that was spread on the stone was very thin and because of the granularity of the stone does not form \u201ca glaze, but what engravers call a grain.",
              "When one looks at the stone through a magnifying glass, one sees that the whole surface of the layer of varnish has regular cracks and furrows at the points where the stone was laid bar\u201d\u2018.",
              "This figure shows the profile of the layer around one of these grainy points : When exposing a negative, the more transparent it is the more light the asphalt layer will receive and consequently will harden more deeply.",
              "Around each grain the thickness of the insoluble part of the asphalt layer is a function of the amount of light received.",
              "During revealing, the area of asphalt that will be dissolved in the hollow spaces between the grains decreases as a function of the light received.",
              "When there is a great deal of light the asphalt points are larger than in areas where there was less light.",
              "When the stone is engraved with acid around these points, consequently cleaned of their asphalt, one obtains large points where the negative received a great deal of light (the black parts in the original).",
              "The surface of these points will receive the printer\u2019s ink transferred from the press to paper with a darker hue than for those zones where the points were small.",

              "P.",
              "Clerc stated that this technique \u201cwas used until only recently in various colour lithography plants\u201d.",
              "What is unusual about this technique is that it works with a dull discontinuous layer of very tightly packed granules rather than with a varnish.",
              "This method facilitates the reproduction of continuous shading which correctly apportions the spread of ink as a result of the fineness of the granulation.",
              "Claude Fe\u0301lix Abel Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor was the son of the first cousin of Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce.",
              "He became famous in photography for having developed the first photographic technique on glass, where all previous techniques on paper, the calotype for example, produced an intermediate negative.",
              "He did all kinds of research, on producing colour photographs, on reproducing engravings and drawings via iodine vapours, and on heliographic engravings based on Bitumen of Judea.",
              "Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor was only interested in making images engraved on metal and did not work with Nice\u0301phore\u2019s iodine inversion technique.",
              "The changes he introduced to heliography had to do with the composition of the varnish, the solvent used to make the image appear, the technique used to spread the solvent and the techniques used to engrave.",
              "The varnish that he used was composed of 90 parts of benzene, 10 parts of essential oil of lemon and two parts of asphalt.",
              "The solvent he used was composed of five parts of oil of naphtha to one part benzene.",
              "The varnish was very diluted in a very volatile solvent.",
              "The layer of asphalt obtained was consequently so thin that it displayed iridescence like a film of oil on the surface of water.",
              "As a result exposure time was decreased because the thickness of the asphalt that was to become insoluble was slight.",
              "Another consequence was the capacity of the acid to etch the metal across the layer of asphalt, which had increased compactness the more light it received.",
              "With such a fine layer of varnish, it becomes difficult to reproduce a large range of shades, contrary to the procedure that Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce used.",
              "For the procedure we are describing here, this inability to reproduce shades through varying the thickness of the varnish was not considered a difficulty.",
              "This is due to the fact that, in photoengraving, gradation in shading is accomplished by varying the density of the grains, each of which can have the same thickness of varnish.",
              "The sensitivity of a varnish is a function of its thickness.",
              "The thinner it is the better.",
              "Using the varnish of Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor, only 10 minutes of exposition of a glass plate to direct sunlight were needed to obtain a result, whereas 2 to 3 hours of exposure were necessary for an engraving made with translucent paper.",
              "Both these times were much lower than those for Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce\u2019s heliographs.",
              "Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor also discovered how to presensitize asphalt.",
              "By exposing asphalt in powdered or dissolved form to sunlight and air for a few hours, he increased its sensitivity.",
              "In Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce\u2019s method, presensitizing was done when heat was applied to dry the varnish, a process that Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor did not use.",
              "He seemed not to have observed the ageing of asphalt solutions in the absence of light, which, after a few days or even a few weeks, makes them more and more sensitive.",
              "We have a few printed documents that reproduce drawings or photographs made using the technique perfected by Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor.",
              "I have been able to see several prints made with this process, made by Pauline Riffaut and finished by the engraver A.",

              "Examination under a printer\u2019s glass clearly shows that Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor\u2019s were unusable in the form they took after the action of the acid.",
              "In fact, they served as a guideline for the engraver who, after the acid bite, executed the engraving by hand by following the forms and shadings that had been cut into the surface.",
              "Only the background of the image was not retouched.",
              "It was made of an aquatint grain either obtained through traditional nitric-acid engraving methods or by acid applied to a very thin layer of varnish that had been largely dissolved.",
              "Accounts at the time of Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor confirm the fact that the images lacked halftone effects and it is worthy of mention that the images that were published were always retouched by an engraver.",
              "Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor\u2019s use of asphalt was special and unique in the history of photomechanical methods.",
              "What he did was to try to obtain a halftone engraving through asphalt varnish known for its exceptional impermeability to acids.",
              "We will see that, in the other techniques developed after Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor, the varnish was always used either as a screen to the acids or as insulation against electroplate metal deposits.",
              "Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor\u2019s method did not last for very long, in particular because it always required the intervention of an engraver.",
              "Its merit was that it was a pioneering method and opened the way to newer methods.",

              "All the shading prints as deep black independently of their diverse densities in the photograph.",
              "Since it is incapable of reproducing the subtle rage of halftones, it is this method that Ne\u0300gre set himself to perfecting\u201d.",
              "The techniques employed by Nie\u0301pce and Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor made a picture from a positive original (an image projected in a camera obscura, engraving on paper or positive photographic proof on glass).",
              "That used by Charles Ne\u0300gre had the advantage of arriving at the same result but directly from a negative like those obtained from a camera obscura.",

              "The image produced by the asphalt on a metal base is positive.",

              "This is where the originality of Ne\u0300gre\u2019s methods enters in.",
              "He used the insulating properties of asphalt varnish to cover the bare sections with a fine layer of a metal like gold, less oxidizable than the base often made of steel or zinc (b).",
              "The method used was electroplating.",
              "The metal plate holding the image produced by the asphalt acted as one of the electrodes of a battery and was plunged in a solution of metal salts that were to be deposited on it.",
              "When the gold deposit was made, the asphalt layer was eliminated (c).",
              "On the base, the areas that were not to be engraved became visible because of the layer of gold that protected them.",
              "When the plate was subsequently plunged in an acid, the gold was not affected but the unprotected areas were gradually engraved (d).",
              "Ne\u0300gre thus obtained an engraving that could be used for printing.",
              "In addition, the gold salts gradually penetrated the varnish, which was prepared in the manner of Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor.",
              "This resulted in the formation of a thin gold network that, after etching by acid, produced a grain on the surface of the image and facilitated the fixing of ink and provided excellent adhesion during printing.",
              "Thanks to this method, Charles Ne\u0300gre was able to produce some of the most beautiful heliographic engravings in the history of photomechanical techniques.",
              "For example, the view made in 1854 of the Cathedral of Chartres, Central Window of the Royal Portal.",
              "The dimensions of this plate are 725 by 480 mm.",

              "Unable to reduce the very long exposure times by either chemical or optical means, Nie\u0301pce in 1829 finally gave in to the repeated overtures of Louis-Jacques-Mande\u0301 Daguerre, a Parisian painter, for a partnership to perfect and exploit heliography.",
              "Nie\u0301pce died without seeing any further advance, but, building on his knowledge, and working with his materials, Daguerre eventually succeeded in greatly reducing the exposure time through his discovery of a chemical process for development of (making visible) the latent (invisible) image formed upon brief exposure.",

              "Over the next decade he tried an array of chemicals, materials, and techniques to advance the process he ultimately called he\u0301liographie, or 'sun writing.'",
              "To make the heliograph, Nie\u0301pce dissolved light-sensitive bitumen in oil of lavender and applied a thin coating over a polished pewter plate.",
              "He inserted the plate into a camera obscura and positioned it near a window in his second-story workroom.",
              "After several days of exposure to sunlight, the plate yielded an impression of the courtyard, outbuildings, and trees outside.",
              "Writing about his process in December 1827, Nie\u0301pce acknowledged that it required further improvements, but was nevertheless \"the first uncertain step in a completely new direction.\"",
              "In 1829 Nie\u0301pce entered into formal partnership with Louis-Jacques-Mande\u0301 Daguerre (French, 1787\u20131851), proprietor of the famous Diorama in Paris.",
              "Daguerre continued to make vital improvements after Niepce's death and introduced his \"Daguerreotype\" process in 1839.",
              "After that stunning announcement, the Nie\u0301pce Heliograph was brought forth by early supporters as evidence of his role in photography's invention.",

              "7 March 1765 \u2013 5 July 1833)[1] was a French inventor and one of the earliest pioneers of photography.",
              "[2] Nie\u0301pce developed heliography, a technique he used to create the world's oldest surviving product of a photographic process: a print made from a photoengraved printing plate in 1825 (see View from the Window at Le Gras).",
              "[3] In 1826 or 1827, he used a primitive camera to produce the oldest surviving photograph of a real-world scene.",
              "Among Nie\u0301pce's other inventions was the Pyre\u0301olophore, one of the world's first internal combustion engines, which he conceived, created, and developed with his older brother Claude Nie\u0301pce.",
              "[4] Nie\u0301pce was born in Chalon-sur-Sao\u0302ne, Sao\u0302ne-et-Loire, where his father was a wealthy lawyer.",
              "His older brother Claude (1763\u20131828) was also his collaborator in research and invention, but died half-mad and destitute in England, having squandered the family wealth in pursuit of non-opportunities for the Pyre\u0301olophore.",
              "Nie\u0301pce also had a sister and a younger brother, Bernard.",
              "[5][6][7] Nice\u0301phore was baptized Joseph but adopted the name Nice\u0301phore, in honour of Saint Nicephorus the ninth-century Patriarch of Constantinople, while studying at the Oratorian college in Angers.",
              "At the college he learned science and the experimental method, rapidly achieving success and graduating to work as a professor of the college.",
              "Nie\u0301pce served as a staff officer in the French army under Napoleon, spending a number of years in Italy and on the island of Sardinia, but ill health forced him to resign, whereupon he married Agnes Romero and became the Administrator of the district of Nice in post-revolutionary France.",
              "In 1795, he resigned as administrator of Nice to pursue scientific research with his brother Claude.",
              "One source reports his resignation to have been forced due to his unpopularity.",
              "[5][6][7] In 1801 the brothers returned to the family's estates in Chalon to continue their scientific research, and where they were united with their mother, their sister and their younger brother Bernard.",
              "Here they managed the family estate as independently wealthy gentlemen-farmers, raising beets and producing sugar.",
              "[5][6][7] In 1827 Nie\u0301pce journeyed to England to visit his seriously ill elder brother Claude Nie\u0301pce, who was now living in Kew, near London.",
              "Claude had descended into delirium and squandered much of the family fortune chasing inappropriate business opportunities for the Pyre\u0301olophore.",
              "[5] Nice\u0301phore Nie\u0301pce died of a stroke on 5 July 1833, financially ruined such that his grave in the cemetery of Saint-Loup de Varennes was financed by the municipality.",
              "The cemetery is near the family house where he had experimented and had made the world's oldest surviving photographic image.",
              "[6] His son Isidore (1805\u20131868) formed a partnership with Daguerre after his father's death and was granted a government pension in 1839 in return for disclosing the technical details of Nice\u0301phore's heliogravure process.",
              "[5][6] A cousin, Claude Fe\u0301lix Abel Nie\u0301pce de Saint-Victor (1805\u20131870), was a chemist and was the first to use albumen in photography.",
              "He also produced photographic engravings on steel.",
              "During 1857\u20131861, he discovered that uranium salts emit a form of radiation that is invisible to the human eye.",
              "[8] The date of Nie\u0301pce's first photographic experiments is uncertain.",
              "He was led to them by his interest in the new art of lithography,[9] for which he realized he lacked the necessary skill and artistic ability, and by his acquaintance with the camera obscura, a drawing aid which was popular among affluent dilettantes in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.",
              "The camera obscura's beautiful but fleeting little \"light paintings\" inspired a number of people, including Thomas Wedgwood and Henry Fox Talbot, to seek some way of capturing them more easily and effectively than could be done by tracing over them with a pencil.",
              "Letters to his sister-in-law around 1816 indicate that Nie\u0301pce had managed to capture small camera images on paper coated with silver chloride,[10] making him apparently the first to have any success at all in such an attempt, but the results were negatives, dark where they should be light and vice versa, and he could find no way to stop them from darkening all over when brought into the light for viewing.",
              "Nie\u0301pce turned his attention to other substances that were affected by light, eventually concentrating on Bitumen of Judea, a naturally occurring asphalt that had been used for various purposes since ancient times.",
              "In Nie\u0301pce's time, it was used by artists as an acid-resistant coating on copper plates for making etchings.",
              "The artist scratched a drawing through the coating, then bathed the plate in acid to etch the exposed areas, then removed the coating with a solvent and used the plate to print ink copies of the drawing onto paper.",
              "What interested Nie\u0301pce was the fact that the bitumen coating became less soluble after it had been left exposed to light.",
              "Nie\u0301pce dissolved bitumen in lavender oil, a solvent often used in varnishes,[11] and thinly coated it onto a lithographic stone or a sheet of metal or glass.",
              "After the coating had dried, a test subject, typically an engraving printed on paper, was laid over the surface in close contact and the two were put out in direct sunlight.",
              "After sufficient exposure, the solvent could be used to rinse away only the unhardened bitumen that had been shielded from light by lines or dark areas in the test subject.",
              "The parts of the surface thus laid bare could then be etched with acid, or the remaining bitumen could serve as the water-repellent material in lithographic printing.",
              "Nie\u0301pce called his process heliography, which literally means \"sun drawing\".",
              "[12] In 1822, he used it to create what is believed to have been the world's first permanent photographic image,[13] a contact-exposed copy of an engraving of Pope Pius VII, but it was later destroyed when Nie\u0301pce attempted to make prints from it.",
              "[13] The earliest surviving photographic artifacts by Nie\u0301pce, made in 1825,[3] are copies of a 17th-century engraving of a man with a horse and of what may be an etching or engraving of a woman with a spinning wheel.",
              "They are simply sheets of plain paper printed with ink in a printing press, like ordinary etchings, engravings, or lithographs, but the plates used to print them were created photographically by Nie\u0301pce's process rather than by laborious and inexact hand-engraving or drawing on lithographic stones.",
              "They are, in essence, the oldest photocopies.",
              "One example of the print of the man with a horse and two examples of the print of the woman with the spinning wheel are known to have survived.",
              "The former is in the collection of the Bibliothe\u0300que nationale de France in Paris and the latter two are in a private collection in the United States.",
              "Nie\u0301pce's correspondence with his brother Claude has preserved the fact that his first real success in using bitumen to create a permanent photograph of the image in a camera obscura came in 1824.",
              "That photograph, made on the surface of a lithographic stone, was later effaced.",
              "In 1826 or 1827 he again photographed the same scene, the view from a window in his house, on a sheet of bitumen-coated pewter.",
              "The result has survived and is now the oldest known camera photograph still in existence.",
              "The historic image had seemingly been lost early in the 20th century, but photography historians Helmut and Alison Gernsheim succeeded in tracking it down in 1952.",
              "The exposure time required to make it is usually said to have been eight or nine hours, but that is a mid-20th century assumption based largely on the fact that the sun lights the buildings on opposite sides, as if from an arc across the sky, indicating an essentially day-long exposure.",
              "A later researcher who used Nie\u0301pce's notes and historically correct materials to recreate his processes found that in fact several days of exposure in the camera were needed to adequately capture such an image on a bitumen-coated plate.",
              "[14][15] In 1829,[16] Nie\u0301pce entered into a partnership with Louis Daguerre, who was also seeking a means of creating permanent photographic images with a camera.",
              "Together, they developed the physautotype, an improved process that used lavender oil distillate as the photosensitive substance.",
              "The partnership lasted until Nie\u0301pce's death in 1833, after which Daguerre continued to experiment, eventually working out a process that only superficially resembled Nie\u0301pce's.",
              "[17] He named it the \"daguerre\u0301otype\", after himself.",
              "In 1839 he managed to get the government of France to purchase his invention on behalf of the people of France.",
              "The French government agreed to award Daguerre a yearly stipend of 6,000 francs for the rest of his life, and to give the estate of Nie\u0301pce 4,000 francs yearly.",
              "This arrangement rankled Nie\u0301pce's son, who claimed Daguerre was reaping all the benefits of his father's work.",
              "In some ways, he was right\u2014for many years, Nie\u0301pce received little credit for his contribution.",
              "Later historians have reclaimed Nie\u0301pce from relative obscurity, and it is now generally recognized that his \"heliography\" was the first successful example of what we now call \"photography\":[11] the creation of a reasonably light-fast and permanent image by the action of light on a light-sensitive surface and subsequent processing.",
              "Although initially ignored amid the excitement caused by the introduction of the daguerreotype, and far too insensitive to be practical for making photographs with a camera, the utility of Nie\u0301pce's original process for its primary purpose was eventually realized.",
              "From the 1850s until well into the 20th century, a thin coating of bitumen was widely used as a slow but very effective and economical photoresist for making printing plates.",
              "The Pyre\u0301olophore, one of the world's first internal combustion engines that was actually built, was invented and patented by the Nie\u0301pce brothers in 1807.",
              "This engine ran on controlled dust explosions of lycopodium powder and was installed on a boat that ran on the river Sao\u0302ne.",
              "Ten years later, the brothers were the first in the world to make an engine work with a fuel injection system.",
              "[18] In 1807 the imperial government opened a competition for a hydraulic machine to replace the original Marly machine (located in Marly-le-Roi) that delivered water to the Palace of Versailles from the Seine river.",
              "The machine was built in Bougival in 1684, from where it pumped water a distance of one kilometer and raised it 150 meters.",
              "The Nie\u0301pce brothers conceived a new hydrostatic principle for the machine and improved it once more in 1809.",
              "The machine had undergone changes in many of its parts, including more precise pistons, creating far less resistance.",
              "They tested it many times, and the result was that with a stream drop of 4 feet 4 inches, it lifted water 11 feet.",
              "But in December 1809 they got a message that they had waited too long and the Emperor had taken on himself the decision to ask the engineer Pe\u0301rier (1742\u20131818) to build a steam engine to operate the pumps at Marly.",
              "[19] In 1818 Nie\u0301pce became interested in the ancestor of the bicycle, a Laufmaschine invented by Karl von Drais in 1817.",
              "He built himself a model and called it the ve\u0301locipe\u0300de (fast foot) and caused quite a sensation on the local country roads.",
              "Nie\u0301pce improved his machine with an adjustable saddle and it is now exhibited at the Nie\u0301pce Museum.",
              "In a letter to his brother Nice\u0301phore contemplated motorizing his machine.",
              "[20] The lunar crater Nie\u0301pce is named after him.",
              "The Nie\u0301pce Heliograph is on permanent display at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.",
              "The object was located by historians Alison and Helmut Gernsheim in 1952 and sold to the Humanities Research Center (later renamed the Harry Ransom Center) in 1963.",
              "[21] The Nie\u0301pce Prize has been awarded annually since 1955 to a professional photographer who has lived and worked in France for over 3 years.",

              "[12] Historians Helmut Gernsheim and his wife, Alison Gernsheim, tracked down the photograph in 1952 and brought it to prominence, reinforcing the claim that Nie\u0301pce is the inventor of photography.",
              "They had an expert at the Kodak Research Laboratory make a modern photographic copy, but it proved extremely difficult to produce an adequate representation of all that could be seen when inspecting the actual plate.",
