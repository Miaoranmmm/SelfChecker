              "She added that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu may result from our brain's attempt to make sense of these perceived similarities and create a feeling of recognition, even if we cannot consciously recall the original experience.",
              "Historically, scientists have struggled to recreate de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in the laboratory because it's difficult to identify stimuli that can evoke the feeling.",

              "From their result, it was not the hippocampus, a key brain region responsible for memory retrieval, that was active, but the medial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in resolving conflicts between what we remember experiencing and what we've actually experienced.",
              "According to O'Connor, this region of the brain shoots off a signal when such a mismatch occurs, and this may explain why de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is more common in young people than old.",
              "As a person gets older, de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is not as frequent because \"the general checking system is in decline,\" he told New Scientist, making it difficult for them to discern false memories.",

              "The current view of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in healthy participants is that it is a memory error which exposes the nature of the memory system.",
              "According to models of memory and consciousness, our memory system is guided by feedback from experiential states and cognitive cues (experience based metacognition, e.",
              "g., [10]).",
              "For example, memory retrieval is guided by feelings of fluency and familiarity.",
              "A quick assessment of familiarity for part of an encoded item, for instance, is a likely signal that some more information about that item can be sought for [11].",
              "The experience of novelty, on the other hand, signals the need to encode information in a scene or location [12].",
              "In short, de\u0301ja\u0300 vu occurs when the feeling of familiarity is decoupled either from the actual experience of a stimulus which is unfamiliar (see also Spatt [13]) or when familiarity is felt for material for which the prior experience is forgotten or unknown.",
              "The resulting mismatch is an erroneous feeling of familiarity for a stimulus which is simultaneously known by the experient to be unfamiliar.",
              "This second part, of knowing that the feeling is wrong is critical for the experience\u2014feelings of false familiarity which are unopposed by the knowledge that they are false would be termed false positives within a recognition memory paradigm.",
              "Such errors are relatively common and are easy to produce in the laboratory, especially when the information is semantically related to a target episode, where the gist of an original trace is incorrectly recognized as old, such as endorsing the word \u201csofa\u201d as old when it was the word \u201csettee\u201d that was studied [14].",
              "Likewise, brief subliminal presentations of words in recognition tests can increase the likelihood of the item being endorsed as having occurred on a previous study list on the basis of familiarity [15].",
              "To reiterate, this does not produce de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, since the participant is not aware of the \u201cfalse\u201d nature of the familiarity for the previously unpresented items in the recognition memory test.",
              "Other decouplings of epistemic feelings and memory processing can occur.",
              "For instance, jamais vu (often described as the inverse of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu\u2014a sense of unfamiliarity for a familiar stimulus), by our view would arise because someone has the experience of novelty for a stimulus which they nonetheless know to be familiar.",
              "One other similar clash of evaluations between consciousness and memory is the tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) phenomenon;",
              "people can feel with some certainty that they know a word but are temporarily unable to reproduce it (e.",
              "g., [16]).",
              "The critical issue with the ToT is that it seems to signal that material is accessible without actually accessing that material itself, suggesting a reflective \u201cfeeling\u201d which is part of the retrieval process from memory, and yet which does not yield the sought-for item itself, and is somewhat disconnected from it.",
              "The nearest laboratory analogue for our account of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in healthy participants is \u201crecognition without identification\u201d (RWI)\u2014a line of reasoning began by Brown and Marsh [2].",
              "In their study, participants shallowly processed pictures of visual scenes and were one week (Experiment 1) and three weeks (Experiment 2) later asked to report the likelihood they had visited the places.",
              "They were able to instill a bias in retrieval which the participants were not aware of, and some compared this to de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "Picking up on this work, Cleary and Reyes [17] have produced a de\u0301ja\u0300 vu-like experience in healthy participants by arranging for them to process materials during an encoding phase in such a way that they are able to \u201crecognise\u201d materials but not know from where they encountered the information.",
              "For instance, participants may perceive a set of scenes in a study phase and see very similar scenes in a test phase.",
              "There is sufficient overlap that the participant feels that they have encountered the scene but cannot pinpoint the source of this feeling.",
              "Interestingly, there are similar accounts of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu historically.",
              "Knight [18] experienced de\u0301ja\u0300 vu whilst in Tibet and, subsequently, suggested that this was due to the vivid descriptions of Laputa in Swift's Gulliver's Travels, a similarity which was not apparent or retrieved at the time of the de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "Cleary proposes a similarity hypothesis of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu arising due to familiarity with a scene caused by an overlap with a previous experience which is undetected by the person experiencing it.",
              "Familiarity is an entity which is relatively well understood in the brain (for review see [19]).",
              "For the memory researcher, familiarity is often encountered in reference to recognition memory, where there is a well established dichotomy of recollection and familiarity, the dual process view.",
              "According to this view, humans can endorse items as \u201cold\u201d on the basis of two separate processes, recollection and familiarity.",
              "Recollection is associated with a feeling of \u201cmental time travel\u201d which arises alongside the retrieval of specifics from the prior encoding experience.",
              "This may include contextual details such as the source of a piece of information but also fragmentary images, feelings, and thoughts.",
              "Familiarity, on the other hand, is a mere sensation of prior experience, or just \u201cknowing\u201d that something has been encountered before, devoid of any such evocative contextual information.",
              "A predominant view is that familiarity is experienced along a continuum, such that people can evaluate the strength of familiarity, but that recollection is an all-or-nothing state [20].",
              "These issues are critical for the neuroscience of memory since they pertain to different brain areas\u2014the hippocampus and a network of associated brain regions mainly within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is responsible for recollection, and a more isolated perirhinal region is responsible for familiarity [21].",
              "Figure 1 displays a simplified graphical outline of these brain areas, which we will refer to throughout this paper.",
              "Much research is done in this area by using subjective report;",
              "participants are reliably able to distinguish between familiarity and recollection in their recognition test performance, and this produces reliable differences in neural activation as indexed by fMRI [22].",
              "Coronal section of the temporal lobe showing key structures.",
              "It is not surprising therefore that researchers have considered the separate contribution of recollection and familiarity in TLE [23\u201328].",
              "The consensus is that whereas there is impaired recollection in TLE, familiarity is largely spared.",
              "This means that people with TLE can make effective memory judgments on the basis of an assessment of familiarity, but lack recollection.",
              "This is manifested not only in a lack of contextual details in their memories of personal experiences [29] but also on recognition memory tests [27].",
              "By this view, we might expect an increase in de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in patients with TLE which is in some way related to their memory deficit according to the cognitive account above.",
              "This could occur in a chronic form due to the fact that familiarity is intact in TLE, but the retrieval of contextual information is impaired.",
              "One possibility is that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences in TLE are a clinical manifestation of RWI.",
              "This may mean that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in TLE is an earnest error driven by forgetting\u2014scenes may be genuinely familiar to the subject of experience, but they cannot retrieve how they encountered the information previously.",
              "Data-driven accounts such as this [30\u201332] view de\u0301ja\u0300 vu as a bottom-up process, whereby familiarity is actually a relevant assessment of a scene, but the person cannot access why they feel that way (similar things have been produced using hypnosis, e.",
              "g., [33]).",
              "An alternative hypothesis presented by Spatt [13] suggests that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is a result of false activation of an isolated parahippocampal based familiarity system;",
              "in TLE this occurs when familiarity is generated erroneously as part of seizure activity, and is not appropriate to the current scene.",
              "The main way to differentiate these two accounts would be knowing what triggers de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "If it is due to an underlying chronic memory problem we would expect to see it outside of seizure activity, whereas if it is a top-down brain-based memory error, we would expect that it was related to seizure activity.",
              "The first part of the review considers these issues by looking at the incidence and phenomenology of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "Anecdotal reports of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu consistently suggest that it is experienced as part of SPSs in some TLE patients.",
              "Given the frequency of these reports, one might expect then that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is experienced more commonly in TLE than in the normal population.",
              "Several researchers have examined the incidence and nature of de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences in TLE compared to healthy participants.",
              "The key issue is whether there is any diagnostic value to de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences.",
              "A recent large-scale questionnaire study by Adachi et al.",
              "[34] addressed this question.",
              "They administered the Inventory of De\u0301ja\u0300 vu Experiences Assessment (IDEA, [35]) scale, which obtains measures of frequency of occurrence and the subjectively perceived psychobehavioural consequences of having de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "In their sample of 312 patients, 143 had TLE;",
              "these were matched with a control group of 402 healthy adults.",
              "Intriguingly, they found that significantly fewer patients had some form of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu (63.",
              "1%), compared with controls (76.",
              "1%).",
              "This does not tally with the idea stated above that due to temporal lobe dysfunction, and resulting deficits in recollection, people with TLE are disposed to a memory-based de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experience.",
              "This might suggest that there is nothing unique about the de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experience in epilepsy.",
              "Adachi and colleagues were also motivated to investigate whether the subjective experience of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu could be predictive of seizure activity.",
              "They asked patients to differentiate between instances where they were aware the de\u0301ja\u0300 vu was part of seizure activity (seizure recognition form\u2014SR) and those when it occurred as a nonepileptic subjective event (nonseizure recognition\u2014NSR).",
              "The SR form was experienced by 24% of patients and most commonly in TLE, whereas 55.",
              "6% had the NSR form, and 16.",
              "3% encountered both.",
              "In those patients experiencing both types, it was found that the SR form tended to occur more frequently at night, was reported as occurring more recently, and was associated with negative affect and more dissociative features;",
              "hence there were several phenomenological differences between the two.",
              "However, Adachi et al.",
              "[34] found no association between the SR form and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) but patients with MTS experienced the NSR form less frequently than others, that is, they actually, again, had lower levels of the \u201chealthy\u201d form of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "The finding of a lower incidence of any de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in patients therefore provides evidence that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is a \u201chealthy\u201d phenomenon, actually occurring less frequently in people with damage to the temporal lobe.",
              "This suggests that memory dysfunction per se does not lead to de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experience, as was shown in a recent group study examining the relationship between verbal memory and types of SPSs in 42 TLE patients [36].",
              "This also seems reasonable given that other forms of memory impairment which stem from temporal lobe atrophy also do not lead to higher levels of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, for example, Alzheimer's disease or even healthy aging [37].",
              "One way of examining this issue aside of imaging reports of hippocampal sclerosis would be to examine correlations between memory performance and incidence of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "It seems likely that TLE patients in particular, however, are more likely to report de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences due to the different and perhaps more striking phenomenological characteristics when it is experienced as part of a seizure.",
              "Future research should explore this phenomenology further.",
              "One possibility might be that it is false feelings of recollection and not familiarity which are elevated in epilepsy\u2014we return to this idea below.",
              "Another questionnaire study compared the qualitative characteristics of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu and jamais vu in 15 TLE patients with 115 university students [38].",

              "In controls, however, de\u0301ja\u0300 vu was more likely to occur for unfamiliar locations and people, cause surprise, and happen more often in a state of mental fatigue.",
              "Common characteristics between the two types included the average duration of the phenomenon (in the order of seconds) and a feeling of nostalgia.",
              "In contrast to Adachi et al.",
              "[34], the authors did not find de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences to be associated with negative emotion, although jamais vu tended to be associated with negative emotions and fear.",

              "They found that patients with jamais vu experienced more negative affect and fear and were much more likely to develop psychotic symptoms compared to those with de\u0301ja\u0300 vu and reminiscence, which were primarily associated with positive or neutral affect.",

              "Initially, he only reported experiencing de\u0301ja\u0300 vu auras, but this had developed into a reduplicative paramnesia in which he persistently felt like he was reliving an isolated four year period of his life.",

              "The authors suggested that his initial de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experiences were likely to have arisen from mild abnormalities in the mesial temporal familiarity circuit, but chronic epileptiform activity may have resulted in neuroplastic regenerative changes involving the hippocampus and a distributed memory network responsible for recollection.",

              "De\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu may have a sense of pastness and of some prior context and an expectation of what will happen next, but without the generation of material which can corroborate the experience, in this sense recall of information is partial and inaccessible, such as with the ToT.",
              "In sum, within epilepsy, if it were possible to better classify de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences, we think that it would give some indication of whether familiarity or recollective networks were involved in the epileptic activity.",

              "There are several strands to this argument.",
              "First we have observed that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in TLE does not appear to be data driven, but persists whatever stimulus is being attended to [42].",
              "Second, seizure and nonseizure-related forms of de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences can be differentiated by TLE patients [34].",
              "This suggests that there is seizure-like cause of the phenomenon, and a more \u201cnormal\u201d form.",
              "Third, we might expect that if a recognition failure is behind de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, then those people who had de\u0301ja\u0300 vu should have poorer memories, which is not generally observed [36].",
              "Finally, our own clinical experience is that people with TLE have de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in objectively novel locations and experiences.",
              "The RWI account requires only for a similarity between a previous event and a subsequent experience which goes undetected.",
              "In very novel situations with little or no overlap with any prior experience, we would not expect de\u0301ja\u0300 vu to occur, but our own experience is that this is just when de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is most likely to be experienced.",
              "That said, RWI experiments are relatively straight forward, and it is a research priority to examine the neural substrates of such effects in comparison to de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, and to test groups of TLE people who do and do not experience de\u0301ja\u0300 vu on RWI tasks.",
              "Our alternative account is the decoupled familiarity hypothesis, where familiarity is experienced in a way that is at odds with the outputs of current processing.",
              "By our account, in a de\u0301ja\u0300 vu experience, familiarity is free-floating and unrelated to the sensed environment, and not triggered by the environment\u2014it is a random top-down brain event.",
              "This is an idea which receives some support from parahippocampal hypometabolism findings, structural damage and cortical stimulation in TLE.",
              "Spatt [13] produced a similar parahippocampal account of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, but his account emphasised the role of the familiarity system in pattern matching.",
              "According to the pattern-matching account, de\u0301ja\u0300 vu arises because a present experience is erroneously matched to a prior experience.",
              "The limitation of this erroneous pattern matching account is that it fails to explain the clash in evaluations experienced in de\u0301ja\u0300 vu.",
              "One aspect of the pattern matching account is that it should also generate false memories, on the occasions when the false match is very strong.",
              "However, our impression is that false memory syndromes are rare in TLE, and, although this issue remains ripe for further research, it seems that de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is not related to the generation of false memories and confabulation (but see the single case reported in [80]).",
              "We also started this paper with the aim of elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying de\u0301ja\u0300 vu in TLE.",

              "A research priority would be to begin to use common definitions and examples across laboratories and participants.",
              "Because so much research outside the de\u0301ja\u0300 vu literature differentiates experiences of recollection and familiarity, we suggest that this is a good place to start.",
              "We also propose that the field begins to consider de\u0301ja\u0300 vu-like fragmentary images retrieved unintentionally in TLE as involuntary memories [83, 84].",

              "On the other hand, using TLE to understand de\u0301ja\u0300 vu has been criticised on the grounds that healthy de\u0301ja\u0300 vu is unlikely to derive from seizure-like activity (even though there seem to be definite physiological triggers for de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, such as stress or fatigue [1]).",

              "Like forms of the de\u0301ja\u0300 experience itself, there may be a continuum of experience between healthy and TLE experiences, and again, the true nature of these experiences may never be elucidated without hypotheses based on neuroscientific models and a consensus amongst researchers regarding definitions.",
              "Certainly, the classification of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu we have attempted here will be of use to de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences of any aetiology.",
              "De\u0301ja\u0300 experiences in epilepsy do reveal something about the working of the brain.",
              "Within epilepsy, restricted activation of memory networks used for memory retrieval on a physiological level results in peculiar experiential phenomena-restricted (or artificially isolated) activation of the familiarity network leads to de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, and activation of a wider network, again, restricted insofar as it does not lead to complete retrieval, leads to de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu.",
              "Thus, de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences expose the nature of the circuitry and the epistemic feelings associated with retrieval processes.",

              "Similarly, a number of authors have pinpointed specific neuro-oscillations in the theta range as being critical in the activation of de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences [61, 63].",
              "On a more theoretical level, the nature of the networks involved in de\u0301ja\u0300 vu and de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu echo those supposedly for the separate memory experiences (and processes) of familiarity and recollection.",

              "[61] suggests a network account of de\u0301ja\u0300 vu, which is similar to the idea that familiarity and recollection lie on a unidimensional scale, with their differences being captured in the notion of trace strength.",
              "According to single-process accounts, high-strength memory traces can be retrieved with the sensation of recollection (or at least \u201chigh confidence\u201d), whereas a low-strength memory traces elicit mere familiarity with the cue.",

              "s studies seem to address this issue from a direct electrophysiological viewpoint.",
              "The \u201ctrace strength\u201d in these experiments could be thought of literally, as the level of current applied to the cortex.",

              "g., [57, 58]).",
              "This leads to a more nuanced view of whether human recognition memory relies on dual or single processes\u2014trace strength at one specific point predicts the extent of activation to more dispersed and specialized circuits in concert with the original stimulated point.",
              "Thus, the coactivation and synchronization of brain areas seen in after discharges leading to de\u0301ja\u0300 ve\u0301cu and involuntary memories may represent an account of how a putatively single trace can recruit multiple brain regions and mental representations to produce recollection, which by our view, would be anatomically and procedurally separate from the sensation of familiarity.",
              "Artificially induced de\u0301ja\u0300 experiences in epileptic patients seem an ideal test of single-versus dual-process accounts of recognition memory in humans.",
