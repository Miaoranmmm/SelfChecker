    "query": "What is the most effective approach for encouraging healthy eating habits in children, and what strategies have schools, parents, and communities successfully implemented to promote better nutrition and reduce childhood obesity?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Healthy eating habits in children are important for their growth, development, and well-being. They can also help prevent or reduce the risk of childhood obesity, which is a serious health problem that affects many children in the United States and around the world.\n\nAccording to the web sources I found, some of the most effective approaches for encouraging healthy eating habits in children are:\n\n- Being a role model for your children by eating a variety of nutritious foods and limiting junk food[^1^].\n- Providing plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products at each meal and snack[^2^] [^4^].\n- Limiting sugary drinks, added sugars, saturated fats, and salt in your children's diet[^2^] [^4^].\n- Offering a wide range of foods and exposing your children to new foods repeatedly, as they may need several tries before they accept them[^1^] [^2^].\n- Creating a meal and snack schedule and sticking to it as much as possible[^2^].\n- Encouraging home-cooked family meals and involving your children in planning and preparing them[^6^].\n- Making healthy snacks available and easy to access for your children[^1^].\n- Reducing screen time and replacing it with family time or physical activity[^5^].\n- Helping your children stay active for at least 60 minutes every day by doing fun activities together or joining sports or clubs[^2^] [^5^].\n- Setting consistent sleep routines and ensuring your children get enough sleep every night[^5^].\n\nSome of the strategies that schools, parents, and communities have successfully implemented to promote better nutrition and reduce childhood obesity are:\n\n- Including nutrition education in schools to teach children about the role of nutrition in their health and wellness[^6^].\n- Providing healthy school meals and snacks that meet the dietary guidelines for Americans[^2^].\n- Creating school wellness policies that support healthy eating and physical activity among students and staff[^2^].\n- Establishing school gardens or farm-to-school programs that connect students with local farmers and fresh produce[^2^].\n- Organizing parent workshops or support groups to share information and resources on healthy eating and weight management for children[^2^].\n- Partnering with local organizations or businesses to offer incentives or discounts for healthy food choices or physical activity opportunities[^2^].\n- Advocating for policies or environmental changes that make healthy food and drink options more accessible and affordable in your community[^2^].\n- Supporting community initiatives that create safe and attractive spaces for walking, biking, playing, or exercising[^2^].\n\nI hope this information helps you learn more about how to encourage healthy eating habits in children and what strategies have been effective in preventing childhood obesity.

              "Partially in contrast with these two reflections are the conclusions of the Cochrane review, that does not identify effects deriving from interventions on diet and physical activity conducted in the preschool setting and, on the contrary, found efficacy in interventions conducted at home or in the community [20].",

              "This result is perfectly consistent with the theoretical model of obesity as a result of an imbalance between the intake of energy with the diet and energy expenditure with physical activity: acting on both these aspects, more consistent results are obtained.",
              "The universal advice (from pregnancy to old age) to follow a healthy diet with particular reference to the Mediterranean diet model as a protective approach against overweight and obesity in childhood recurs, more or less explicitly, in many of the considered papers [27,40,41,61,80,81,86].",
              "A reduction in the intake of sugary drinks is likely to translate into benefits in terms of weight, whereas the use of caloric sweeteners is still being discussed, both in terms of safety and effectiveness in reducing weight gain [73,74,75].",

              "Therefore, as Pereira-da-Silva concludes in his systematic review on the diet of preschool children, the interventions that determine an improvement in the intake rates of these foods should be implemented and \u201cdaily consumption of whole fresh fruit and vegetables should be promoted\u201d [81].",
              "The need for a multidimensional approach to obesity prevention in children, in order to increase the efficacy of interventions, is an aspect that recurs in many studies [2,5,13,67,68].",
              "The WHO Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity suggests that part of the responsibility for the failure of interventions that influence behavior changes of the individual is precisely linked to the fact that they concern only the individual subject [5].",
              "Since obesity is a multifactorial pathology, a multi-level and diversified approach according to the target is necessary.",
              "In the prenatal, infant, and preschool age, the training of parents and caregivers on issues such as healthy nutrition, physical activity, and sleep hygiene can have a significant impact [20].",
              "In older children and adolescents, an approach that modifies the food environment (vending machines, water fountains, advertising) and facilitates physical activity may be more suitable [2,20].",
              "At a higher level, prevention programs should imply the gradual remodeling of economic, agricultural, industrial, environmental, socio-educational, recreational and health policies, including those aimed at contrasting socio-economic and ethnic minorities\u2019 inequalities [17,78,89].",
              "Finally, a concept that summarizes the efforts in obesity prevention is that expressed by the Italian national program \u201cGaining health\u201d [90]: \u201cMaking healthy choices easier and less easy harmful choices\u201d [90], or even more recently by the American Institute of Medicine \u201cCreate food and beverage environments that ensure that healthy food and beverage options are the routine, easy choice\u201d [85].",
              "These claims mean that it is necessary to act at a policy level to make the healthier choice easier and immediate compared to the less healthy one.",

              "The search then performed manually should however have reduced this occurrence.",
              "Second, more emphasis has been placed on studies published since 2015 (in particular, 9 of the 14 reviews considered in the large part of the work base were published in 2019 or 2020).",
              "This choice aimed to find recent data for the conclusions drawn;",
              "on the other hand, it could have caused the loss of some relevant information published at an earlier time point.",
              "Third, some of the conclusions were based on observational studies, for which confounding factors in the results cannot therefore be excluded.",
              "Fourth, the fact of having performed a search for reviews, only evaluating the original studies from which they derive in some cases, has probably led to the inclusion of the same study in more than one review, even if the reviews often included different kinds of studies and different age groups.",
              "Finally, the use of BMI as the main outcome of many studies may not always be satisfactory as it may not show changes in body composition consisting, for example, of a reduction in fat mass associated with an increase in lean mass.",
              "The prevention of childhood obesity still represents a major challenge for the scientific community.",
              "A multidimensional approach, which takes into consideration different areas of intervention, is crucial.",
              "Integrated programs involving several components (nutrition and physical activity at first), different levels (from the individual to the institutions, with school and family as main settings), and with a prolonged duration over time, are more effective, but long-term data are still scarce.",
              "More studies need to be conducted from the early stages of life and new success indicators in addition to BMI, such as more direct measurement of fat and lean mass, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness, should be included in future studies.",

              "For future interventions, we recommend emphasizing the use of content adapted to foods available by season, area, customs and family economy, in order to promote better adherence and avoid the stigma that healthy eating is perceived as more expensive [30].",
              "The emotional aspect derived from the relationship that individuals have with food should also be taken into account and addressed in the context of an efficient program focused on preserving health, not on weight loss as the ultimate goal.",
              "We also found that it would have been interesting to analyze the demographic characteristics of the parents to identify possible barriers that could hinder the intervention, in this way, strategies to overcome these barriers could be implemented.",
              "This parent-only intervention program administered in the school setting at the initiation of early childhood education achieved a significant improvement in the BMI of the children whose parents received the educational intervention, especially in the children who started with a high BMI for their age.",

              "g., healthcare setting, community) [46].",
              "From 2 years of life, the interventions that are most consistently effective in preventing obesity in children are those conducted in a school setting [53,54,61], in particular if they include a component carried out in the family environment [53,54].",
              "This is even clearer, considering that children spend a significant part of the day in preschool and school settings, often consuming more than one meal there a day.",
              "Furthermore, the school already has a structural and conceptual infrastructure that includes the task of education and change of habits [67].",
              "Family involvement also plays a pivotal role given the influence that the family and the domestic environment have on the health-related behaviors of children and adolescents [83,84], widely recognized by organizations dealing with the problem [5,78,85].",
              "Partially in contrast with these two reflections are the conclusions of the Cochrane review, that does not identify effects deriving from interventions on diet and physical activity conducted in the preschool setting and, on the contrary, found efficacy in interventions conducted at home or in the community [20].",
              "However, caution is necessary in comparing these data due to the different subdivision by age group between the revisions considered.",
              "About the effectiveness of the different interventions analyzed in the age group from conception to 2 years, some strategies focused on nutrition appeared to be particularly promising.",
              "The promotion of breastfeeding and the reduction in the protein content of formulated milks and more generally of the diet in the first 12\u201324 months is another promising intervention for the reduction of the subsequent risk of overweight and obesity [27,28,33,37,40,41,42,86,87,88].",
              "Although still partially discussed [44], the advice to avoid the introduction of complementary foods before 4 months can be considered useful for reducing the rates of overweight and obesity [27,42,85].",
              "From 2 years of age, the studies are substantially in agreement in considering the approaches that combine interventions on nutrition and physical activity to be more effective [20,53,54,67].",
              "However, an efficacy of approaches based on nutrition or physical activity individually is not excluded, depending on the age of the subjects and the contexts of application [20,53,54,61].",
              "This result is perfectly consistent with the theoretical model of obesity as a result of an imbalance between the intake of energy with the diet and energy expenditure with physical activity: acting on both these aspects, more consistent results are obtained.",
              "The universal advice (from pregnancy to old age) to follow a healthy diet with particular reference to the Mediterranean diet model as a protective approach against overweight and obesity in childhood recurs, more or less explicitly, in many of the considered papers [27,40,41,61,80,81,86].",
              "A reduction in the intake of sugary drinks is likely to translate into benefits in terms of weight, whereas the use of caloric sweeteners is still being discussed, both in terms of safety and effectiveness in reducing weight gain [73,74,75].",
              "The intake of fruit, vegetables, and foods rich in fiber has positive effects on various health parameters (satiety, body weight regulation, glycemic control, blood lipids, intestinal microbiota modulation, etc.)",
              "[76,81,86].",
              "Therefore, as Pereira-da-Silva concludes in his systematic review on the diet of preschool children, the interventions that determine an improvement in the intake rates of these foods should be implemented and \u201cdaily consumption of whole fresh fruit and vegetables should be promoted\u201d [81].",
              "The need for a multidimensional approach to obesity prevention in children, in order to increase the efficacy of interventions, is an aspect that recurs in many studies [2,5,13,67,68].",
              "The WHO Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity suggests that part of the responsibility for the failure of interventions that influence behavior changes of the individual is precisely linked to the fact that they concern only the individual subject [5].",
              "Since obesity is a multifactorial pathology, a multi-level and diversified approach according to the target is necessary.",
              "In the prenatal, infant, and preschool age, the training of parents and caregivers on issues such as healthy nutrition, physical activity, and sleep hygiene can have a significant impact [20].",
              "In older children and adolescents, an approach that modifies the food environment (vending machines, water fountains, advertising) and facilitates physical activity may be more suitable [2,20].",
              "At a higher level, prevention programs should imply the gradual remodeling of economic, agricultural, industrial, environmental, socio-educational, recreational and health policies, including those aimed at contrasting socio-economic and ethnic minorities\u2019 inequalities [17,78,89].",
              "Finally, a concept that summarizes the efforts in obesity prevention is that expressed by the Italian national program \u201cGaining health\u201d [90]: \u201cMaking healthy choices easier and less easy harmful choices\u201d [90], or even more recently by the American Institute of Medicine \u201cCreate food and beverage environments that ensure that healthy food and beverage options are the routine, easy choice\u201d [85].",
              "These claims mean that it is necessary to act at a policy level to make the healthier choice easier and immediate compared to the less healthy one.",
              "This would make the choice of these \u201cprotective\u201d foods/drinks passive, against their active research which, on the contrary, would require effort and time and therefore would not be always easily practicable.",
              "Our study has some limitations.",
              "First, the search performed focused on only two databases (PubMed and Cochrane Library) and, thus, may have missed some relevant publications.",
              "The search then performed manually should however have reduced this occurrence.",
              "Second, more emphasis has been placed on studies published since 2015 (in particular, 9 of the 14 reviews considered in the large part of the work base were published in 2019 or 2020).",
              "This choice aimed to find recent data for the conclusions drawn;",
              "on the other hand, it could have caused the loss of some relevant information published at an earlier time point.",
              "Third, some of the conclusions were based on observational studies, for which confounding factors in the results cannot therefore be excluded.",
              "Fourth, the fact of having performed a search for reviews, only evaluating the original studies from which they derive in some cases, has probably led to the inclusion of the same study in more than one review, even if the reviews often included different kinds of studies and different age groups.",
              "Finally, the use of BMI as the main outcome of many studies may not always be satisfactory as it may not show changes in body composition consisting, for example, of a reduction in fat mass associated with an increase in lean mass.",
              "The prevention of childhood obesity still represents a major challenge for the scientific community.",
              "A multidimensional approach, which takes into consideration different areas of intervention, is crucial.",
              "Integrated programs involving several components (nutrition and physical activity at first), different levels (from the individual to the institutions, with school and family as main settings), and with a prolonged duration over time, are more effective, but long-term data are still scarce.",
              "More studies need to be conducted from the early stages of life and new success indicators in addition to BMI, such as more direct measurement of fat and lean mass, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness, should be included in future studies.",
              "Nevertheless, policy intervention, inducing the whole community to make healthier choices, could help to protect from the obesogenic environment.",
              "Pediatricians, who follow the child from birth, play a key role in prevention, and should intervene early to guarantee active family involvement associated with nutritional and lifestyle counseling.",

              "School-based interventions can have important potential for obesity prevention and promotion of physical activity and fitness if they focus more on the content, quality, duration and priority of the physical activity.",
              "Physical activity (PA) is one of the most effective ways of preventing cardiovascular and mental illnesses and improving physical fitness (PF).",
              "Regular PA reduces the risk factors of many diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity [1].",
              "On the other hand, inactivity may cause obesity and a low level of cardiovascular fitness and increase the risk of high blood pressure and cholesterol with children.",
              "This situation also may lead to the development of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes during adulthood [2].",
              "In the systematic study of Janssen and Leblanc [3] where the relationship between PA, PF, and health of school-age children and adolescents were examined, it was found that PA contributed significantly to health, especially in high-risk youth, and that PA should be continued at least moderately to maintain health benefits and that vigorous activities provided more benefits.",
              "In another systematic study examining the interventions to increase moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) PA in physical education classes, it was concluded that the intervention could increase MVPA levels throughout the course and provide significant benefits to public health [4].",
              "To achieve health benefits, it is recommended to exercise with MVPA intensity for five days a week or more for at least 30 min, or with vigorous intensity for at least 20 min for 3 days [5].",
              "The World Health Organization (WHO) [6] recommends MVPA for children and adolescents for at least 60 min per day.",
              "Despite the importance of regular PA, PA levels have started to decrease together with the new tools such as smartphones, computers, tablets, video games and social media, that have come into our lives in relation to technology [1].",
              "PF of children has also declined with low levels of PA [7].",
              "High levels of PF in children and adolescents are linked to physical and mental health [8].",
              "At this point, the role of schools, where children and adolescents spend a significant portion of their days, in providing PA opportunities has reached an even more critical point.",
              "Despite this critical situation, the scope, quantity and quality of physical education courses, as well as the participation rates in extracurricular physical activities are not at the desired levels and differ significantly from school to school [9,10,11].",
              "Schools are easy and provide accessible settings to promote engagement in PA because it is related to the objectives of the physical education curriculum.",
              "Children can learn the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for lifelong PA habits in schools.",
              "WHO [6] maintained that \u201call children and young people should be physically active with the support of schools or public institutions through games, sports, recreation, physical education and planned physical activities\u201d and underlined the mission of schools regarding PA.",
              "School-based PA interventions include various categories such as physical education curriculum, classroom activity breaks, active commuting to school, modified playgrounds and comprehensive multi-component approaches.",
              "Along with learning in psychomotor, cognitive and affective domains, PA and PF levels will be promoted and obesity will be prevented over time.",
              "In this context, the priority is that children have meaningful learning experiences during their school years.",
              "Considering the seriousness of problems, which may occur related to inactivity in children, increasing school-based PA options of children and ensuring that children spend time with PA at schools should be considered a vital task.",
              "Although PA programs in schools are one of the primary sources for promoting PA and FP, children are not active enough and their obesity/overweight levels have reached alarming levels [12,13,14,15].",
              "A sedentary lifestyle and changing dietary habits have significantly increased obesity among children and adolescents [16].",
              "Overweight and obesity are operationally defined as \u2018\u2018abnormal or excessive fat accumulations that negatively affect health\u2019\u2019 [17].",
              "WHO accepts childhood obesity as one of the most important global problems of the 21st century [18].",
              "Overweight or obesity is a very complex phenomenon with many different causes.",
              "Although it is widely accepted that the increase in obesity stamps from the imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, it is known that there are many other genetic, environmental and behavioral reasons.",
              "The ecological model, as described by Davison et al.",
              ", suggests that child risk factors for obesity include dietary intake, PA, and sedentary behavior [19].",
              "In addition, environmental and socio-cultural factors such as family characteristics and parents\u2019 lifestyle, school policies, and screen culture affect eating and activity behaviors [20].",
              "Therefore, school-based intervention programs to prevent obesity should be designed and diversified in a comprehensive and multicomponent way.",
              "Physical inactivity is one of the most important factors in the emergence of obesity [21,22].",
              "Traditional interventions for overweight or obesity include training in healthy nutrition and changing lifestyles by increasing PA.",
              "In this context, interventions based on increasing PA are often considered to be the most effective method, not only because they help in weight control but also because of health benefits such as the strengthening of bones and muscles, better sleep, improving mental health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease [3,23].",
              "In a longitudinal study performed on more than 6000 children at the age of 7 years doing regular PA, it was concluded that performing PA was associated with the body fat percentage of children at the age of 11 years [24].",
              "Again, researches conducted on children aged between 4 and 18 show that being engaged in regular PA has basic health benefits such as the increasing of bone density, good blood pressure and the improving of metabolic or cardiopulmonary health [3,25].",
              "Apart from these, the benefits of PA can be stated as increased attention span, healthy functioning of cognitive processes, mental health and a general state of being healthy [26,27].",
              "Regardless of the intensity, PA is associated with better health, motor skills and positive cognitive outcomes [28].",
              "School-based PA is a necessary process that requires the structuring of all the time spent in the school, beginning with the planning of the child starting the day actively as s/he comes to school.",
              "In order to increase the participation of children in PA in schools and to prevent obesity effectively, it is necessary to increase the active time in physical education courses, to diversify the content of the course, to reevaluate the teacher qualifications and the number of students, to examine the effectiveness of programs for recess, in-school activity, extracurricular activities and school teams. Some systematic studies conducted in this respect have shown that school-based interventions can be effective in preventing obesity and promoting PA [29,30,31].",
              "On the other hand, there are also studies in which variables such as obesity, PA and sedentary behavior are measured and no significant development can be observed [23,32,33].",
              "In a significant part of the studies carried out in the literature, the differentiation of the success of situations in terms of the variables examined necessitates the examination of the studies conducted in this field from different aspects [34,35,36].",
              "In this systematic review, it is aimed to contribute to the literature from different perspectives by including variables such as the content, type and duration of the physical activity which can directly affect the success of the school-based programs and are not sufficiently emphasized in other systematic review studies.",
              "Additionally, more studies are needed to evaluate the different contexts regarding the potential of school-based interventions.",
              "In this context, the study aims to systematically examine the possibility of school-based interventions for preventing obesity and promoting PA and PF.",
              "The framework used analytically by Kahn et al.",
              "[37] and modified by Demetriou and Honer [30] was organized and used particularly in this study.",
              "In this sense, the expected characteristics of the school-based interventions, the expected outcomes and the interventions that are accepted to be used outside of PA in such programs are presented in Figure 1.",

              "109 Powerful interest groups have traditionally slowed the actions of governmental and non-governmental organizations (such as the World Health Organization) in addressing reductions in added sugar.",
              "110,111 However, in 2014, the World Health Organization issued draft guidelines to limit sugars to 5% of total daily energy intake, while in 2015, the USA Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee issued a scientific report recommending that the federal government limit added sugars to below 10% of total daily energy intake.",
              "112,113 Both sets of recommendations are currently in draft format.",

              "Part of the reason such interventions are appealing is that they do not rely on people making effortful changes or comprehending complex health information.",
              "119 For example, in 2015 major fast-food chains McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, and Burger King all dropped soft drinks from their children\u2019s menus,120 shifting the default beverage to a healthier option.",

              "24 Attempts to nudge consumers to make healthier food choices through subtle environmental cues such as smaller plate size and pre-committing to healthier food choices by ordering food ahead of time, have shown some potential to reduce calorie consumption.",
              "121 However, these types of strategies typically represent small \u201cp\u201d policies that must be undertaken voluntarily by companies or institutions.",
              "One example of a government policy designed to change the large portion size that is default in restaurants was a 2012 proposal in NYC to limit the portion size of sugary drinks sold in food service establishments to 16 ounces (~500 mL).",
              "This policy was struck down because the NYC Board of Health did not have the legal authority to enact it, but it remains a viable policy option.",
              "Although there are no shortage of creative ideas to use nudges to improve the food environment,122 a recent randomized controlled trial found no long-term effects for a school-based nudge intervention, and there have been few other evaluations of such interventions in the long-term.",

              "Echoing previous findings,24 we see a need for systematic, large-scale efforts to address unhealthy diets.",
              "Policymakers must also recognize the double burden of under nutrition and obesity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and design policies with both issues in mind.",
              "Further, funding levels to evaluate the impact of major food policies in high-income countries are very low, and there is essentially no funding for evaluation in low- and middle-income countries.",
