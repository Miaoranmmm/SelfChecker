    "query": "What inspired the creation of the iconic video game, Super Mario Bros, and how did it become one of the most successful and beloved video game franchises in history?",
    "response": "Super Mario Bros is a classic video game that has a fascinating history behind its creation and success. According to various sources[^2^] [^3^] [^5^], the game's designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, originally wanted to make a game based on Popeye, but he couldn't get the rights to use the characters. So he came up with his own original characters: a carpenter named Jumpman (later renamed Mario), his girlfriend Pauline, and a giant ape named Donkey Kong[^1^] [^5^]. The game was a hit in arcades and Miyamoto decided to make more games featuring Mario, who became a plumber and gained a brother, Luigi. He also changed the setting from a construction site to a fantasy world called the Mushroom Kingdom, where Mario had to rescue Princess Peach (or Toadstool) from the evil Bowser[^2^] [^3^]. The game was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985 and became one of the best-selling games of all time[^2^]. It also spawned many sequels, spin-offs, and adaptations in various media.\n\nOne of the reasons why Super Mario Bros was so successful and beloved was its innovative gameplay, which introduced many features that are now common in platform games. For example, Mario could run faster by holding down a button, jump higher by bouncing on enemies, collect power-ups that gave him different abilities, and explore secret areas by finding hidden pipes and blocks[^2^] [^4^]. The game also had catchy music composed by Koji Kondo, who created a theme that matched the fast-paced and cheerful mood of the game[^4^]. The game's graphics were colorful and detailed, and the characters had expressive animations and sounds.\n\nSuper Mario Bros is widely regarded as one of the most influential and important video games in history. It helped popularize the platform genre, inspired many other game developers, and established Nintendo as a leading company in the industry. It also made Mario a cultural icon and a symbol of gaming. The game has been re-released and remastered several times over the years, and it still remains fun and challenging for players of all ages. Super Mario Bros is truly a masterpiece of game design and a landmark in gaming history.",

              "He joined the industry as a designer for character art in 1977.",

              "Miyamoto decided to study industrial design at Kanazawa College of Art in 1970.",
              "Miyamoto only attended his classes half of the time, and it took him five years to graduate.",
              "Miyamoto was 24 when his father contacted an old friend, named Hiroshi Yamauchi, at the toy company Nintendo.",

              "Although Popeye was created in the 1930s, Paramount Pictures debuted the movie Popeye starring Robin Williams, just months before Donkey Kong was released [16].",
              "Nintendo was committed enough to Miyamoto\u2019s Popeye idea that it tried to secure a license to use the characters in the game.",
              "Nintendo failed to secure the rights, so Miyamoto converted the characters to Mario, Donkey Kong, and Pauline (yes that\u2019s her name).",
              "Miyamoto appears to have been the first video game designer to attempt to develop a game based on an existing pop culture character [17].",
              "The innovative nature of that design choice may have led to Miyamoto\u2019s idea being selected \u2013 but this isn\u2019t documented.",
              "Failure to secure the Popeye license points to another essential characteristic of Miyamoto \u2013 his willingness to stick with it, even when things don\u2019t go as planned.",
              "That characteristic plays out multiple times in Miyamoto\u2019s future career, especially when faced with the disappointing market response to the Nintendo Game Cube and the Wii U.",
              "From the beginning of his career, Miyamoto was very user-centered (player-centered).",
              "There are various examples of this from Donkey Kong including Miyamoto\u2019s desire to have the entire Donkey Kong story be understandable after seeing just a single screen at the arcade (climb the structure, save the prisoner from the enemy).",
              "This way potential players could intuitively know what needs to be done.",
              "Miyamoto frequently put his games in front of people without explaining anything to them.",
              "Then he just watched to see where they naturally struggle with the design.",
              "Being user-centered in this way has been a consistent part of his career.",
              "Almost immediately after Donkey Kong\u2019s success, Miyamoto began working on Mario Brothers (1983), which quickly led to Super Mario Brothers (1985).",
              "The Mario video game franchise (which includes all Mario video games) is the top selling franchise in the world at 760 million copies sold.",
              "To put this into perspective, the Minecraft franchise has sold 240 million copies [18].",
              "Mario\u2019s distinct features were designed to enhance player experience.",
              "Mario\u2019s shape, size, and movement are all great examples of Miyamoto\u2019s approach to user centeredness, since they are designed for good user experience.",
              "Mario\u2019s relatively large head a nose are sized to make it clear to the user which way Mario is pointed.",
              "Mario\u2019s mustache and hat where part of the original design to make it so that facial expressions and hair movement would not need to be modeled unrealistically in the 8 bit format.",
              "Instead they could be hidden and left to the player\u2019s imagination.",
              "Mario\u2019s movement and control were also very important to Miyamoto, since he wanted each player to feel immersed in the game.",
              "Miyamoto did this by giving characters mass and inertia.",
              "Miyamoto conveys Mario\u2019s mass by the small slide that occurs when Mario changes direction or lands from a jump.",
              "Perhaps the greatest reflection of Miyamoto\u2019s user-centered approach is the design of World 1-1 in Super Mario Brothers.",
              "The level is designed to teach users how to play the game.",
              "For example, throughout the game, Mario is typically positioned in the center of the screen, but not at the start of World 1-1.",
              "Here Mario is placed on the far left, and is facing the wide open space to the right.",
              "This is designed to teach users where Mario should go.",

              "Bumping the question box from below releases another mushroom that moves in a direction that it is nearly impossible for Mario to avoid.",
              "When he touches it, he grows taller, thus teaching the player that while angry mushrooms will kill Mario, others enhance his abilities.",
              "World 1-1 is full of such teaching.",
              "As for the other worlds, Miyamoto was constantly trying to give players surprises and small wins, such as the hidden objects in walls and fireworks at the end of each world.",
              "Another key example of Miyamoto\u2019s focus on the user experience was his large interest in a player\u2019s ability to naturally control character movement.",
              "This resulted in multiple new and patented game controllers.",

              "One of the things the episode pointed out is that even though Who Framed Roger Rabbit features most of the major players of classic animation, it does not feature Popeye, a fact that had never previously occurred to me Then again, there might be good reason why I never thought about it before: Popeye\u2019s star was dimming, even back when Who Framed Roger Rabbit was released.",
              "I knew who Popeye was because I\u2019d seen some of his classic shorts, and also because Dave Coulier did his Popeye impression on Full House like it was going out of style.",

              "But even if he\u2019s no longer a cartoon star like he once was, Popeye lives on in video game form in ways that his creators would have and could have never envisioned \u2014 and in ways video game fans may not even realize.",

              "It is interesting to me that Nintendo\u2019s first attempt at licensing another company\u2019s copyrighted character was Popeye and not, say, Mickey Mouse, seeing as how Nintendo had a deal with Disney to put its characters on playing cards at least as long as it had a similar deal with King Features, the Hearst-owned syndicate that controls Popeye.",
              "As I will discuss in the third section of this post, Popeye enjoyed a great deal of popularity in Japan, so perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that Nintendo would try to get him \u2014 a character with a lot of recognition, but who might come somewhat cheaper than Mickey Mouse, let\u2019s say \u2014 into a game early on.",
              "What\u2019s curiously absent in any discussion of this early attempt to make a Popeye-themed Nintendo game, however, is the fact that it would have been happening around the same time as the 1980 Robert Altman-directed live-action Popeye film.",
              "Starring Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, the film was critically panned and deemed a flop upon its initial release, though it would eventually earn back its $20 million budget three times over and experience a critical reappraisal as the decades ticked on.",

              "It\u2019s possible that the Popeye movie being perceived as unsuccessful could explain why Nintendo staffers don\u2019t bring it up in their recollections \u2014 they might just have forgotten that there ever was a live action Popeye, as many people do \u2014 but it also might explain why King Features was hesitant about licensing its characters out to other companies.",
              "At the time, Nintendo wouldn\u2019t have been viewed as a top-tier video game company.",
              "In fact, the reason Nintendo was scrambling to come up with a new game idea was in part an effort to recoup losses relating to the failure that was Radar Scope, a 1980 arcade shooter that found success in Japan but not the U.",

              "There is a quote from Yokoi about this short being a direct inspiration, and while it\u2019s often credited to the blog The End of Deep Layer, the blog itself states that the quote comes from the book \u8ecd\u5e73\u6a2a\u4e95\u30b1\u3099\u30fc\u30e0\u9928 (Gunpei Yokoi's House of Games), published in 1997 in Japan and consisting of an interview of Yokoi by journalist Takefumi Makino.",
              "Yokoi explains that the short provided the essence of the game, which remained even after they knew they would not get the rights to the Popeye characters.",
              "Pretty early on we had decided that Popeye would go on the bottom of the screen and Bluto would be on the top, thus establishing the framework for the game, but we would later discover that we wouldn\u2019t be able to get the rights to use the characters after all.",
              "With no other options, we decided to keep the content of the game as it was and just change the characters.",
              "And so it was that those characters became Mario, Donkey Kong, and Princess Peach.",

              "Nintendo, lean on experienced game developers, placed Miyamoto in charge of the project.",

              "It was not only the first real game design Miyamoto had done, but the first time anyone at Nintendo had been deeply involved in the game design process.",
              "Placing an inexperienced designer in front of such an important project might seem like a risky move, but Miyamoto's unique perspective would prove to be his biggest asset.",
              "Miyamoto did not approach game design the way others did.",
              "Where most games at the time involved scenarios drawn from action movies -- shoot-outs, race cars, submarines, and intergalactic battles -- Miyamoto wanted his game to feel like a comic strip come to life.",
              "Even the notion of discrete characters with individual personalities was fairly uncommon in arcade games at the time, but characters and story were fundamental to Miyamoto's vision.",
              "Initially he had hoped to create a game based on Popeye and his perpetual battle with Bluto over his damsel in distress, Olive Oyl.",
              "Nintendo was unable to secure the license -- at least at that time -- so the designer superimposed the classic love triangle over a King Kong theme.",
              "A lovestruck gorilla absconds to the top of a construction site with the prettiest girl he sees, and her carpenter boyfriend has to come to her aid.",
              "Just a picture of the scenario can tell the whole story through the din and distractions of a busy arcade.",
              "Even Miyamoto's methods of communication mirrored the comic medium he was inspired by.",
              "Like Sonic the Hedgehog designer Hirokazu Yasuhara, he would draw pictures of scenarios on paper, each one a whimsical snapshot of how the game would feel.",
              "While jumping wasn't a new mechanic in games, Miyamoto envisioned a character that would have to jump over hazards, onto moving platforms, and across gaps in a way that had never been done before.",
              "The action was just plain fun, funny, and fit perfectly with the game's lighthearted tone.",
              "The game the two companies created communicated quite a bit without the need for words.",
              "The decision to show the giant ape as he scaled the building's scaffolds, to show Pauline crying for help, and to show the gorilla's escape at the end of the level was a bold one at the time.",
              "Normally these things would just be implicit, but Miyamoto wanted to make sure the whole story, simple though it was, could be told on screen in a way that could be instantly grasped by players.",
              "This also allowed for an innovative multi-stage design that boasted four very distinctive screens of action with unique challenges, without confusing the objectives.",
              "Pauline was still near the top of the screen crying for help, and Mario's goal was clear.",
              "That desire to see the new levels, rather than just repeating the same one over again would motivate players, especially the more causal, to drop more quarters into the game in a way that just competing for high score never could.",
              "Yamauchi immediately recognized that Miyamoto's game could be the one to save Nintendo's sinking American operation.",
              "He asked the designer to give the game an English title that Americans could relate to.",
              "Of course, Miyamoto knew very little English, so when he tried to look up a word that would accurately convey his ape's stubbornness, he came up with the somewhat perplexing \"Donkey Kong\".",
              "It didn't matter.",
              "The game arrived just in time to save Nintendo's American division.",
              "The situation was so dire that the company's landlord, Mario Segale, had been coming around demanding the late rent payments owed to him.",
              "Arakawa thought the mustachioed owner looked a bit like the hero of Miyamoto's game, so Jumpman was renamed to Mario in his honor.",
              "Custody BattleWhile Donkey Kong was poised for launch, Nintendo's American arcade division was teetering on the brink.",
              "Resources were so tight that Nintendo of America's three employees had to convert all 2,000 Radar Scope units over to Donkey Kong by themselves.",
              "But once those units started making their ways into the darkened hallways of arcades around the country, Nintendo's only problem was where to get more.",
              "That problem wasn't as straightforward as it sounds.",
              "Ikegami Tsushinki produced the initial shipment of boards, just as they had done for Radar Scope, but Donkey Kong was a huge hit and Nintendo needed more.",
              "Demand was so high in America that Arakawa began manufacturing new units in Nintendo of America's warehouse.",
              "But Nintendo didn't actually own the manufacturing rights to Donkey Kong.",
              "Although their game was still a Nintendo product, and the characters, name, and brand all belonged to it, the development contract gave Ikegami Tsushinki the exclusive rights to manufacture and sell boards to Nintendo for \u00a570,000 each.",
              "After the initial order of 8,000 units, Nintendo ceased to buy boards from Ikegami.",
              "Although the contract was unclear with regard to actual copyright of the program code -- still new territory for the law -- Ikegami was named as the sole supplier for Donkey Kong boards.",
              "Nintendo didn't see it that way.",
              "Before long, Nintendo had manufactured about 80,000 additional units without Ikegami's involvement, burning the bridge with the company that had developed its biggest hit, and opening themselves up to a bitter legal battle that would drag on for almost a decade.",
              "This also left Nintendo without a development team to follow up its smash hit.",
              "Nintendo wanted a sequel, but Ikegami was done with them.",
              "Soon after, Ikegami would go on to anonymously develop the innovative smash hits Zaxxon and Congo Bongo for Sega, contributing to the rise of one of Nintendo's biggest rivals.",
              "Ikegami Tsushinki was clearly an immensely talented team, but its terms were too restrictive for Nintendo's needs, and it needed to find a new partner.",
              "Nintendo hired another contractor called Iwasaki Engineering to disassemble and reverse engineer Donkey Kong so that Nintendo could add new graphics, stages, and mechanics for a sequel.",
              "This time, the nature of the agreement was clear to both sides from the start, and would turn out to be a long and fruitful partnership.",
              "As Nintendo established its internal R&D, many members of Iwasaki would join its ranks.",
              "Before long, Nintendo was developing hit games completely on its own.",
              "Shigeru Miyamoto's mind had been racing with more ideas since before he finished the original Donkey Kong, and his sequel came naturally.",
              "He wanted to show that the eponymous antagonist was more complex than just a big, mean ape, so he considered telling the story from Kong's perspective.",
              "Of course, DK was simply too big to be a player character, and so Miyamoto made him a father, introducing a new hero, Junior, out to rescue his dad from the vindictive Mario.",
              "Ladders gave way to vines and chains, and the barrels were replaced with nasty Snapjaws and birds.",
              "Donkey Kong Jr.",
              "was clever for a sequel released so soon after the original, with patterns that bore little resemblance to its predecessor.",
              "The large amount of moving sprites was quite dazzling in 1982, and the climbing and reaching mechanics offered something fresh from the original.",
              "Once again four unique stages kept the gameplay varied and had players sinking in quarter after quarter to try to make it a little further.",
              "But for all its very original ideas, Donkey Kong Jr.",
              "was still built on code reverse engineered from the original game -- code that was already the center of a copyright dispute.",
              "In 1983, Ikegami Tsushinki filed a \u00a5580 million copyright infringement suit (about $8.",
              "7 million adjusted for exchange rates and inflation) over both Donkey Kong and its sequel.",
              "The legal battle dragged on for years, long after Ikegami left the game development business.",
              "In 1990 a court ruled that Nintendo did not have the rights to Donkey Kong's code, and the two companies settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.",
              "With the case settled and Ikegami long gone from the gaming business, little is said about Miyamoto's anonymous collaborators and the role they played in one of gaming's most important titles.",
              "An Empire Emerges The squabbles surrounding the development of Nintendo's first international hits were barely a blip on the radar compared to the tremendous impact of the game itself.",
              "Donkey Kong and its sequel had effectively given birth to a new genre of side-view jumping games, with countless imitators -- some clever and some blatant -- appearing in America, Japan, and Europe, in arcades, on consoles, and on home computers.",
              "By 1983, folks in the West started calling these \"platform games\".",
              "In 1982, Shigeru Miyamoto got to make his Popeye game, officially licensed and all, on brand new, more powerful hardware.",
              "Nintendo went on to develop a third game in the Donkey Kong series with an all-new protagonist, Stanley the Exterminator.",
              "The third in the trilogy bore little resemblance to its predecessors, abandoning the platform mechanics in favor of an unconventional shooter motif that had Stanley pressuring DK into a beehive with his bug spray.",
              "It failed to take off like the earlier games did, and Donkey Kong was put on a long hiatus.",
              "With an internal development team and a small stable of strong brands in place, the stage was set for Nintendo's most ambitious move yet.",
              "In 1983, Nintendo released its brand new Famicom console with three ports of Shigeru Miyamoto's arcade games: Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr.",

              "While concessions were made for ROM size and resolution, the ports were simply much closer to the real arcade experience than any home system could deliver up to that point, paving the way for Nintendo's extended domination of the console market.",

              "In just a few short years, Nintendo had changed the gaming landscape.",
              "Donkey Kong has continued to be one of Nintendo's most recognizable characters, albeit in a form that would be almost unrecognizable to gamers in 1981.",
              "But Kong's legacy is far greater than that.",
              "If you can't imagine a world without Super Mario Brothers, without the NES, and maybe even without Nintendo at all, then you can't imagine a world without Donkey Kong.",
              "Both as a remarkable piece of game design and a commercial breakthrough for the single most important gaming company in Japan, Donkey Kong changed the world, and 30 years later we're still feeling its effects.",

              "Miyamoto had never designed a game before, but he had been doodling ideas for characters even as he worked on Nintendo's cabinets.",
              "Yamauchi assured him his lack of technical skills would not be a problem.",
              "Miyamoto would simply give direction to the team at Ikegami Tsushinki, and it would develop the game according to his ideas.",
              "Gunpei Yokoi -- later known as the father of the Game Boy -- would further guide Miyamoto on technical and design concerns.",
              "It was not only the first real game design Miyamoto had done, but the first time anyone at Nintendo had been deeply involved in the game design process.",
              "Placing an inexperienced designer in front of such an important project might seem like a risky move, but Miyamoto's unique perspective would prove to be his biggest asset.",
              "Miyamoto did not approach game design the way others did.",
              "Where most games at the time involved scenarios drawn from action movies -- shoot-outs, race cars, submarines, and intergalactic battles -- Miyamoto wanted his game to feel like a comic strip come to life.",
              "Even the notion of discrete characters with individual personalities was fairly uncommon in arcade games at the time, but characters and story were fundamental to Miyamoto's vision.",
              "Initially he had hoped to create a game based on Popeye and his perpetual battle with Bluto over his damsel in distress, Olive Oyl.",
              "Nintendo was unable to secure the license -- at least at that time -- so the designer superimposed the classic love triangle over a King Kong theme.",
              "A lovestruck gorilla absconds to the top of a construction site with the prettiest girl he sees, and her carpenter boyfriend has to come to her aid.",
              "Just a picture of the scenario can tell the whole story through the din and distractions of a busy arcade.",
              "Even Miyamoto's methods of communication mirrored the comic medium he was inspired by.",
              "Like Sonic the Hedgehog designer Hirokazu Yasuhara, he would draw pictures of scenarios on paper, each one a whimsical snapshot of how the game would feel.",
              "While jumping wasn't a new mechanic in games, Miyamoto envisioned a character that would have to jump over hazards, onto moving platforms, and across gaps in a way that had never been done before.",
              "The action was just plain fun, funny, and fit perfectly with the game's lighthearted tone.",
              "The game the two companies created communicated quite a bit without the need for words.",
              "The decision to show the giant ape as he scaled the building's scaffolds, to show Pauline crying for help, and to show the gorilla's escape at the end of the level was a bold one at the time.",
              "Normally these things would just be implicit, but Miyamoto wanted to make sure the whole story, simple though it was, could be told on screen in a way that could be instantly grasped by players.",
              "This also allowed for an innovative multi-stage design that boasted four very distinctive screens of action with unique challenges, without confusing the objectives.",
              "Pauline was still near the top of the screen crying for help, and Mario's goal was clear.",
              "That desire to see the new levels, rather than just repeating the same one over again would motivate players, especially the more causal, to drop more quarters into the game in a way that just competing for high score never could.",
              "Yamauchi immediately recognized that Miyamoto's game could be the one to save Nintendo's sinking American operation.",
              "He asked the designer to give the game an English title that Americans could relate to.",
              "Of course, Miyamoto knew very little English, so when he tried to look up a word that would accurately convey his ape's stubbornness, he came up with the somewhat perplexing \"Donkey Kong\".",
              "It didn't matter.",
              "The game arrived just in time to save Nintendo's American division.",
              "The situation was so dire that the company's landlord, Mario Segale, had been coming around demanding the late rent payments owed to him.",
              "Arakawa thought the mustachioed owner looked a bit like the hero of Miyamoto's game, so Jumpman was renamed to Mario in his honor.",
              "While Donkey Kong was poised for launch, Nintendo's American arcade division was teetering on the brink.",
              "Resources were so tight that Nintendo of America's three employees had to convert all 2,000 Radar Scope units over to Donkey Kong by themselves.",
              "But once those units started making their ways into the darkened hallways of arcades around the country, Nintendo's only problem was where to get more.",
              "That problem wasn't as straightforward as it sounds.",
              "Ikegami Tsushinki produced the initial shipment of boards, just as they had done for Radar Scope, but Donkey Kong was a huge hit and Nintendo needed more.",
              "Demand was so high in America that Arakawa began manufacturing new units in Nintendo of America's warehouse.",
              "But Nintendo didn't actually own the manufacturing rights to Donkey Kong.",
              "Although their game was still a Nintendo product, and the characters, name, and brand all belonged to it, the development contract gave Ikegami Tsushinki the exclusive rights to manufacture and sell boards to Nintendo for \u00a570,000 each.",
              "After the initial order of 8,000 units, Nintendo ceased to buy boards from Ikegami.",
              "Although the contract was unclear with regard to actual copyright of the program code -- still new territory for the law -- Ikegami was named as the sole supplier for Donkey Kong boards.",
              "Nintendo didn't see it that way.",
              "Before long, Nintendo had manufactured about 80,000 additional units without Ikegami's involvement, burning the bridge with the company that had developed its biggest hit, and opening themselves up to a bitter legal battle that would drag on for almost a decade.",
              "This also left Nintendo without a development team to follow up its smash hit.",
              "Nintendo wanted a sequel, but Ikegami was done with them.",
              "Soon after, Ikegami would go on to anonymously develop the innovative smash hits Zaxxon and Congo Bongo for Sega, contributing to the rise of one of Nintendo's biggest rivals.",
              "Ikegami Tsushinki was clearly an immensely talented team, but its terms were too restrictive for Nintendo's needs, and it needed to find a new partner.",
              "Nintendo hired another contractor called Iwasaki Engineering to disassemble and reverse engineer Donkey Kong so that Nintendo could add new graphics, stages, and mechanics for a sequel.",
              "This time, the nature of the agreement was clear to both sides from the start, and would turn out to be a long and fruitful partnership.",
              "As Nintendo established its internal R&D, many members of Iwasaki would join its ranks.",
              "Before long, Nintendo was developing hit games completely on its own.",
              "Shigeru Miyamoto's mind had been racing with more ideas since before he finished the original Donkey Kong, and his sequel came naturally.",
              "He wanted to show that the eponymous antagonist was more complex than just a big, mean ape, so he considered telling the story from Kong's perspective.",
              "Of course, DK was simply too big to be a player character, and so Miyamoto made him a father, introducing a new hero, Junior, out to rescue his dad from the vindictive Mario.",

              "Once again four unique stages kept the gameplay varied and had players sinking in quarter after quarter to try to make it a little further.",
              "But for all its very original ideas, Donkey Kong Jr.",

              "And if you think about it, the big nose and the mustache is not a facial feature that's characteristic of Japanese people.",
              "And so I think that my connection to those Italian comics \u2014 probably I drew on that inspiration when we first drew the character.",
              "And so when we first drew the character in Donkey Kong, he was drawn using pixel dots in a 16x16 grid.",
              "So it was a very small space in which to draw the character, and it was a very small character on the screen.",
              "And so in order to emphasize the unique characteristics of the character, we made the big nose and the mustache and the overalls to make it easy to understand what the character was doing on the screen.",
              "When we sent the game to the U.",
              "S.",
              "to sell the Donkey Kong arcade games in America, in the warehouse that the Nintendo was operating out of in America at that time, there was somebody related to that warehouse whose name was Mario.",
              "And the staff at Nintendo in America said that the character looked like the individual named Mario.",
              "So they started calling the character Mario, and when I heard that I said 'Oh, Mario's a great name \u2014 let's use that.'",
              "\" And he has a hat.",
              "He wears a hat because as I mentioned we had very few dots available to us to draw the character, and trying to draw hair that moves while you run would've been very complicated.",
              "So we gave him a hat to make it easier to draw but make him still look realistic.",
              "Many people always talk about how inventive your games are, and I have heard that your childhood \u2014 the sense of wonder you bring \u2014 comes from growing up in Japan.",
              "I heard a story about once you stumbled upon a lake when you were a child and that sense of wonder is what you try to bring to all of your games.",
              "Is that a true story?",
              "That's correct.",
              "When I was younger, I grew up in the countryside of Japan.",
              "And what that meant was I spent a lot of my time playing in the rice paddies and exploring the hillsides and having fun outdoors.",
              "When I got into the upper elementary school ages \u2014 that was when I really got into hiking and mountain climbing.",
              "There's a place near Kobe where there's a mountain, and you climb the mountain, and there's a big lake near the top of it.",
              "We had gone on this hiking trip and climbed up the mountain, and I was so amazed \u2014 it was the first time I had ever experienced hiking up this mountain and seeing this big lake at the top.",
              "And I drew on that inspiration when we were working on the Legend of Zelda game and we were creating this grand outdoor adventure where you go through these narrowed confined spaces and come upon this great lake.",
              "And so it was around that time that I really began to start drawing on my experiences as a child and bringing that into game development.",
              "When you work on updating games now, do you still bring your life experience into the game?",
              "Yes, it happens very naturally.",
              "After I turned 40, I took up swimming and became very enthusiastic about swimming as a way of exercise.",
              "And right after that was when we made Super Mario 64, and I drew on a lot of my experience swimming in creating the underwater swimming scenes with Mario in that game.",
              "In the latest game, you are letting people create worlds of their own.",
              "How did you come up with the idea to add this to Mario?",
              "This is a very good question, and when people ask me what do I think makes the Mario games unique, of course there's creativity that goes into the creation of those games, but what I always answer is, the creativity of the player is what really makes the Mario games fun.",
              "And particularly with an interactive video game, what's very important is that the player thinks about, \"What is it that I want to try to do?\"",
              "And that I try it, and that I see that feedback and I see that reaction on screen, and that gives me an emotion and response.",
              "It's this cycle of thinking and experimenting in the gameplay and getting that reaction that is unique about the Mario games, and is the core of what makes video games and interactive games fun.",
              "And that to me is a very important part of Mario games in general.",
              "And so we think that with this idea of creative play being such an important element of the Mario games \u2014 that having a system where the players themselves can create the levels and play the levels themselves or create a level and have someone else play it and then immediately edit the level they've just created \u2014 really ties in well to the notion of creative play.",
              "And we felt that with this being the 30th anniversary of Super Mario Bros.",
              "and that sort of marking a delineation point in the Mario life cycle that this would be a very good time to release a product of this nature and introduce this style of creative creation alongside the creative play that's always existed in the Mario games.",
              "How did you come up with the idea of \"Super\" Mario Bros.",
              "?",
              "In the original Mario Bros.",
              ", Mario and Luigi were rather small in size and they would play and battle against each other in that game.",
              "And in the Super Mario Bros.",
              "game, those same small characters are in the game, but when they get a mushroom they get big.",
              "So we decided to call the big version of them \"Super Mario\" and \"Super Luigi\" because they got super-sized.",
              "How did you come up with the idea for the mushrooms?",
              "Well of course getting an item and growing big is sort of a mysterious thing to have happen.",
              "And so we thought, what's the most mysterious item that we could make this so it makes sense why they're getting bigger?",
              "And if you think of stories like Alice in Wonderland and other types of fairy tales, mushrooms always seem to have a mysterious power, and so we thought the mushroom would be a good symbol for why they get it and get big.",
              "Many people have commented on the things you've invented in video games \u2014 like the camera angle.",
              "You're not an engineer, so how did you come up with these different angles on Mario and using the camera when nobody had really done that before?",
              "So when I was younger I used to draw my own comics, and in school I studied industrial design.",
              "So from both of those past experiences, I was always thinking about what's the right angle to draw a picture from or to view something from and was constantly thinking about perspective in that sense.",
              "When were first making games and we were making them in 2-D, creating games in two dimensions is a lot like drawing pictures.",
              "But when 3-D technology came along, and we began to create games using polygonal models, we were no longer just creating pictures \u2014 we had objects that we were having to show.",
              "And in order to show those 3-D solid objects, you had to begin worrying about where the camera would be placed, how it would maneuver around the object.",
              "And we stopped creating pictures and we instead started creating story flows for the flow of scenes in the game and things like that.",
              "And as we were working through that process, it dawned on me that, yes there's a main character in the game, but there's also the camera.",
              "And we need people to understand why the camera is moving \u2014 so the camera itself is almost like a character.",
              "So we came up with this idea that there was Mario, and there's a character who's carrying the camera and that they're going on an adventure together.",
              "And so then what we did \u2014 if you look up, we have a poster here, and there's a character there whose name in English is Lakitu, and he's a turtle who flies around on a cloud from the Super Mario Bros.",
              "games.",
              "We thought he was the perfect character to be holding the camera as he floats around on his cloud and follows Mario on this adventure.",
              "And then I realized that nobody in the world had hit upon this idea, and I got very excited about it and put a lot of effort into conveying this in the game, and we finalized the game with this idea attached to it.",
              "Many game makers always mention that you were first to do this when you talk to them, so they give you credit.",
              "I read that \u2014 I think it was with Donkey Kong \u2014 you wrote the music?",
              "Well, there are two versions of Donkey Kong, and the version on the Nintendo Entertainment System I did only a very little bit of the music.",
              "But in the arcade version, I did the opening music and then the end of it as well.",
              "How come you did the music?",
              "I grew up watching a lot of cartoons and anime, so I just had this image that at the beginning there's always this dramatic music to start things off \u2014 that's where the dramatic (sings tune) came from.",
              "And then for the ending, I play guitar a little bit, and so the end song I put together as a bit of a parody of a song I used to play on guitar.",
              "You started out as an artist;",
              "you went into industrial design.",
              "Do you ever feel like you should have been an artist?",
              "Do you ever feel like video games were meant for you \u2014 like you fell into the thing that was just right for your talents?",
              "I actually feel incredibly fortunate that I found video games because when we started, I had originally as a kid wanted to be a manga artist, a comic artist.",
              "But I gave that up because there were so many other manga artists who were at such a high quality that I felt I couldn't compete with them.",
              "And even in industrial design, I felt that there were so many industrial designers that were so talented that I wouldn't be able to compete with them.",
              "So my thought was that after studying industrial design, I would want to make toys.",
              "But then, when I found video games, it was interesting because I kept finding that video games kept coming across all of the things that I had loved when I was younger, from drawing the comics to being very similar to industrial design from an approach perspective and then music and things like that that I've loved (having to oversee music and approve the music in the games \u2014 it tied into that).",
              "And then we came to the 3-D era of video games, and when I was younger I used to enjoy creating puppets and doing puppet shows, so this was like doing puppet shows in a 3-D video game space.",
              "So I found that even as time progressed in my career as a video game designer, I still kept encountering all the things that I loved when I was younger.",
              "So I truly feel fortunate to have found them.",
              "Your work has a sense of inventiveness.",
              "How do you come up with ideas?",
              "Do you sort of lie around and things just emerge in your mind \u2014 like, oh, I'm going to do this now with Mario?",
              "Well, when we first started we were starting with arcade games where you would put in a quarter and play a game \u2014 we needed to design the game in a way that you would want to put in the next quarter to keep playing.",
              "From there it changed to where we were creating worlds, and we were trying to create worlds that people would want to immerse themselves in, the way you immerse yourself in a book or in a movie.",
              "And then, after that, as I got older I began to realize the things that I was doing in my life at that point as I was older \u2014 things like swimming or sports or when I got a dog \u2014 that these were experiences that I could take and apply the mechanics and the system of a video game and turn those experiences into something that others could enjoy and experience.",
              "So it really has been a process of how to take my experiences and find ways to apply them to video games, and that's evolved over time.",
              "So is Nintendog your dog?",
              "That's right.",
              "At this conference, there's a lot of virtual reality.",
              "Have you seen virtual reality?",
              "What do you think of it?",
              "Yes, I've seen virtual reality, and we experiment with virtual reality and different technologies.",
              "We're quite interested in it, but at the same time, Nintendo's philosophy is that we create products that are going to be played with everyone in the living room.",
              "And we don't feel that virtual reality is a good fit for that philosophy.",
              "And so, while I can't say whether there will be a technology in the future that's a virtual-reality-type experience that fits with that or not, we're here at this conference to showcase the products that we're going to be selling in the next year or so.",
              "We don't have anything in the near future that fits that, and so that's why we're not showing anything in the virtual reality space this year.",
              "One of the things about Nintendo that's always been interesting is you've never tried to make a more powerful console with better graphics, and all the stuff that the Xbox has done.",
              "Can you explain a little why you've kind of stuck with that?",
              "So unfortunately with our latest system, the Wii U, the price point was one that ended up getting a little higher than we wanted.",
              "But what we are always striving to do is to find a way to take novel technology that we can take and offer it to people at a price that everybody can afford.",
              "And in addition to that, rather than going after the high-end tech spec race and trying to create the most powerful console, really what we want to do is try to find a console that has the best balance of features with the best interface that anyone can use.",
              "And the reason for that is that, No.",
              "1, we like to do things that are unique and different from other companies, but we also don't want to just end up in a race to have the highest-tech specs in a competition to try to find how we get these expensive tech specs to the lowest price of the other systems. And so there's different ways that we can approach it, and sometimes we look at it just from the sense of offering a system that consumes less power and makes less noise and generates less heat, or sometimes we may look at the size of the media and the size of the system and where it fits within the home.",
              "But really what's most important to us is, how do we create a system that is both unique and affordable so that everyone can afford it and everyone can enjoy it.",
              "What's the most important thing about making a successful game to you?",
              "For us, the most important thing in making a game is that we make a game that's unique \u2014 something that no one else has created, and something that no one else can create, something that's uniquely Nintendo.",
              "That, for us, is what's most important in creating a game.",
              "The first Wii sold really well;",
              "the Wii U, not so much.",
              "Do you think part of it is the price that the Wii has not sold so well?",
              "So I don't think it's just price, because if the system is appealing enough, people will buy it even if the price is a little bit high.",
              "I think with Wii U, our challenge was that perhaps people didn't understand the system.",
              "But also I think that we had a system that's very unique \u2014 and, particularly with video game systems, typically it takes the game system a while to boot up.",
              "And we thought that with a tablet-type functionality connected to the system, you could have the rapid boot-up of tablet-type functionality, you could have the convenience of having that touch control with you there on the couch while you're playing on a device that's connected to the TV, and it would be a very unique system that could introduce some unique styles of play.",
              "I think unfortunately what ended up happening was that tablets themselves appeared in the marketplace and evolved very, very rapidly, and unfortunately the Wii system launched at a time where the uniqueness of those features were perhaps not as strong as they were when we had first begun developing them.",
              "So what I think is unique about Nintendo is we're constantly trying to do unique and different things.",
              "Sometimes they work, and sometimes they're not as big of a hit as we would like to hope.",
              "After Wii U, we're hoping that next time it will be a very big hit.",
              "So this with Super Mario Maker and being able to design levels on the touchscreen in your hand while watching on the big screen, and with games like Star Fox Zero where the big screen represents sort of a movie-like experience, but with the gamepad and the gamepad screen in your hands, you're able to play a video game simultaneously with the excitement of these cinematic scenes happening on the TV.",
              "And I think that's going to give people a lot of excitement, and I'm hoping that people will be looking forward to playing those games on Wii U in the fall.",
              "Did I hear correctly that now some of the Nintendo characters will move to other devices?",
              "It's not exactly that.",
              "Really what we're thinking about is, outside of Nintendo hardware, there's other media where there are opportunities for people to come in contact with Nintendo characters and Nintendo properties.",
              "So we're looking at how we can leverage those other types of media like mobile to help people encounter our characters and to develop that relationship.",
              "But what we're not going to be doing is taking the same games that are playable on our devices and making those games playable on mobile devices.",
              "So you'll be able to do something that's designed for a mobile device that is a different game, right?",
              "So yeah, if we were to make anything it would be a different experience design for that device.",
              "How do you and (Nintendo's Takashi Tezuka) work together?",
              "Who comes up with the ideas?",
              "The way that it often works is, I'll think up a unique idea, and he'll think up a crazy idea that can't possibly be turned into a video game.",
              "And together we'll massage those ideas into one that can finally be realized as a game.",
              "Over the last 30 years, one of the things I've been trying to do is help him with coming up with ideas that are still unique but can still be easily transformed into a video game.",
              "It seems like there are a lot of international references in your game.",
              "How do you come up with those?",
              "So it is true that both of us read not just things from Japan, but we try to read things and topics from all over the world.",
              "But what we do that's different perhaps from other creators in Japan is we don't look at what's currently popular in Japan and try to replicate that to try to make a game more popular with the Japanese market.",
              "From the very beginning, my first job was to try to make a game for the overseas market, and since that very time I've always thought that we need to not just look at what's popular in Japan \u2014 because what's popular in Japan won't necessarily be popular overseas.",
              "So what we do instead is, if we are drawing on something that's based in Japanese tradition, we'll tend to look at, for example, Japanese folktales.",
              "Or we'll draw on things that are more innately a shared experience of all people regardless of where you're from, and draw on those types of ideas and use those to influence our games, rather than trying to look at what's popular in Japan right now.",
              "I heard that people thought Donkey Kong was going to be a failure at the time.",
              "Yes, we were told that everyone thought that it wouldn't succeed.",
              "But because the game did so well, even today based on that experience, when somebody tells me, \"oh, that name is too strange, it won't work,\" I get very convinced and say: \"Yes, I've thought of something that is very unique!",
              "This is going to do well.\"",
              "You've been working together for over 30 years.",
              "I think about Nintendo's future \u2014 your stamp is so strong on this company.",
              "Do you feel like the company has enough of what you've taught, what you've learned over the years to keep it going after you're gone?",
              "Before we created Super Mario Maker, what we had done is we had created these tools that allowed us to create Mario levels.",
              "And what Mr.",
              "Tezuka had done is use these tools to hold courses within the company over several months to explain his approach to course design.",
              "And so we've had a lot of opportunity to train the staff that we have, and we have a lot of examples of new projects, like the game that we just released, called Splatoon.",
              "Splatoon is a very good example because it used to be that I had many different teams that I could go to when I had an idea for a game that I wanted to make, and I would bring that idea and they would make the game.",
              "But Splatoon was an example of one of those younger teams coming up with an idea of a game they wanted to make and the senior leadership supporting them in making the game they wanted to make.",
              "And so we're at a point where we're starting to see that transition and seeing the benefits from that.",
              "I read that when you first came and were hired by Nintendo, they didn't think much of you at the time.",
              "You were a young kid, right out of college, and that it was kind of like, \"what do I do with this kid?\"",
              "Is that true?",
              "Can you tell the story of how you ended up there?",
              "Forget that story because that's not the right one.",
              "I wanted to create things that would surprise people, so I thought that I had wanted to make toys.",
              "And so I applied to Nintendo wanting to be a designer, but what I was told is that they weren't hiring any designers at the time.",
              "Fortunately a friend of my father's knew the president of Nintendo, Mr.",
              "[Hiroshi] Yamauchi, so my dad's friend said, \"I'll at least try to get you an interview.\"",
              "So I gathered together my portfolio of things that I had made and went to my interview.",
              "Mr.",
              "Yamauchi saw the things I had made and brought with me, and he seemed to like them and he seemed to like me, and so they decided to hire me, and I became the first industrial designer in Nintendo.",
              "And at the time, I think they had only three graphic designers even.",
              "And I think the one story that may be surprising is, one of the things I had brought and shown to Mr.",
              "Yamauchi, I found out later he had submitted a patent on without me realizing it.",
              "So that's how I know that the story that you said is maybe not true.",

              "Before that time, numerous title cards were used in conjunction with Mario games.",
              "The Super Mario games typically take place in the Mushroom Kingdom, a fictional world where players control Mario as the main protagonist.",
              "In some cases, Mario is joined by his brother, Luigi, as well as other well-known characters.",

              "2011 In 2011, the official Super Mario logo was updated and refined.",
              "The letters grew a little wider in shape, and the spacing between each character diminished.",

              "Indeed, many of the initial games in the series had no core logo but instead used box designs featuring unique word marks and images of Mario himself.",
              "In 2006, when the \u201cNew Super Mario Bros\u201d game was introduced for the Nintendo DS, it almost appeared to be introducing a new logo in the form of a white wordmark with a bold black outline.",
