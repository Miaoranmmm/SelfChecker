    "query": "What is the most successful and sustainable solution to address the issue of food waste in developed countries, and how can individuals and businesses implement these strategies in their daily operations?",
    "response": "That's a very important and complex question. There is no single solution to address the issue of food waste in developed countries, but rather a combination of strategies that can be implemented at different stages of the food supply chain and by different actors. Some of the possible solutions are:\n\n- **Improving storage methods** for farmers and retailers to prevent food loss due to pests, spoilage, and damage. For example, using metal silos, plastic bags, or crates to store and transport grains, fruits, and vegetables[^1^].\n- **Redistributing food** that is surplus or unsold to food banks and community groups that can provide it to people in need. For example, SecondBite in Australia redirected 3,000 metric tons of food in 2012 that would otherwise have been thrown away[^2^].\n- **Better food date labels** for consumers to understand the difference between \"use-by\", \"sell-by\", and \"best-before\" dates and avoid discarding food that is still safe and edible. For example, Tesco in the United Kingdom removed \"display until\" dates from packages, leaving only a \"use by\" date[^2^].\n- **Creating entities** devoted to reducing food waste in developed countries through research, education, policy, and innovation. For example, WRAP in the United Kingdom works with businesses and governments on waste reduction[^2^].\n- **Shifting behavioral norms** away from waste and towards valuing food as a precious resource. This can be done through awareness campaigns, education programs, social media, cooking tips, and other means of influencing consumer choices and habits.\n\nThese are some of the ways that individuals and businesses can contribute to reducing food waste in developed countries. However, more research and action are needed to measure and track progress, as well as to increase the availability of food and reduce the environmental footprint of agricultural production[^4^].

              "Back to Stories Back \u00a9IFAD/Susan Beccio On its journey from farm to table, food is too often lost along the way.",
              "This is known as food loss or post-harvest losses \u2013 when agricultural commodities, like cereals or meat, never reach the market.",
              "For small-scale farmers, this can mean a huge blow to their livelihoods and food security.",
              "This is why IFAD promotes reducing food losses \u2013 here\u2019s how.",
              "With better access to finance, small-scale farmers and cooperatives can invest in post-harvest facilities and equipment, like a packing house or a thresher, helping them reduce food losses.",
              "Linking farmers to markets Farmers are less willing to invest in equipment and activities that can reduce their food losses if they cannot make a profit.",
              "Linking producers to markets means they have a steady stream of buyers while reducing food loss.",
              "Improving storage for grains Inadequate post-harvest storage can result in insect and rodent infestations, microbial infections and harmful changes in moisture content \u2013 all of which can lead to losses of produce and livelihoods.",
              "On-farm storage technology, like metal drums and hermetic bags, can virtually eliminate grain losses if used correctly.",
              "Upgrading grain drying equipment Most grain losses occur during storage due to improper drying, leading to mould damage.",
              "Helping farmers acquire drying equipment\u2014from simple tarpaulins to shelters that protect from the rain\u2014is key to reducing food losses.",
              "Cold storage for fresh produce The highest levels of food losses occur with fresh produce, like fruits, vegetables, fish, meat and milk.",
              "Heat is one of the primary causes of spoilage when there is a lack of cold chain equipment and infrastructure.",
              "Supporting farmers and traders in acquiring cooling equipment can substantially reduce losses of fresh produce.",
              "Strengthening transport In remote rural areas, poor transport connectivity means farmers cannot access markets in a timely manner, therefore increasing the risk of damage to their produce.",
              "Extending transport infrastructure to the last mile can have a big impact on food losses.",
              "Building commercial storage Collective storage facilities mean farmers who can\u2019t afford on-farm storage can safely store their crops.",
              "When well maintained, sharing expensive equipment is a financially practical and efficient way to avoid losses.",
              "Training farmers Training farmers on post-harvest handling and storage skills\u2014including timing of harvest, crop drying, moisture management and safe storage\u2014is key to reducing food losses.",
              "Collecting data Rigorous data on the causes and amounts of food losses is needed to accurately identify and target interventions to reduce them.",
              "While there are many methodologies available, the most common one is FAO\u2019s food loss assessment methodology which identifies critical loss points for a value chain.",
              "Developing policies Long-term political commitment to reducing food losses can be achieved by integrating this aim into national agricultural strategies.",
              "This may require providing governments with financial support and technical expertise.",

              "Silo bags For medium-scale grain storage, silo (or grain) bags that originally were developed for anaerobic storage of chopped forages, have been adapted for bulk grain storage, first in Argentina in the early 2000s and from there adopted into many countries around the world.",

              "(2008) proves that silo bags are a viable technology for a range of crops.",
              "For the past several years nearly half of the grain (40 million to 50 million tonnes) produced in Argentina has been stored in silo bags.",
              "Silo bags are a key hermetic storage technology that reduces post-harvest losses while providing an economic alternative for farmers to gain control over marketing their stored grain between crop harvests.",
              "Silo bags consist of three layers of polyethylene totaling 250 microns thick.",
              "The outer layer is white to reflect solar radiation, and the inner layer is black to block sunlight.",
              "A typical silo bag is about 60 meters long, 3 meters in diameter, and can store as much as 200 tonnes of wheat, maize and soybeans, though they can be smaller by simply using less of the bag.",
              "When properly sealed, the silo bag is watertight and has a high degree of gas tightness to CO2 and O2.",
              "The ground upon which a silo bag needs to be placed should be level and should not accumulate standing water during rains.",
              "It also must be free of any objects that could puncture the plastic (i.",
              "e., field stubble, sharp rocks, or branches) because even very small holes will compromise the hermetic seal, allowing air, moisture and insects to enter the grain mass.",
              "Because a high level of CO2 and low level of O2 are the means by which insect and fungal activity is controlled in the silo bag, holes or leaks will permit air exchange with the outside and will confound the desired internal atmosphere.",
              "Grain is loaded and unloaded from a silo bag using special equipment that can be attached to a PTO-driven tractor.",
              "The silo bags and equipment to load and unload the grain are relatively inexpensive compared to permanent grain storage structures and the associated grain handling equipment.",
              "Loading and unloading equipment cost about $50,000, and each silo bag costs about $600.",
              "Equipment is becoming increasingly available as dealers and service suppliers pick up on the trend in countries that have adopted silo bag usage.",
              "The storage environment within a silo bag can be monitored with handheld CO2 sensors along the length of a bag.",
              "Data with bag number, position along the bag and GPS-based location identifier is uploaded automatically via mobile phone technology for online monitoring and record-keeping.",
              "Damp grain should not be stored in silo bags.",
              "In warm temperatures, higher moisture grain creates an interstitial equilibrium relative humidity (RH) above 65% to 70%, which provides a good environment for fungi to develop.",
              "While it has been shown that low oxygen environments can prevent the proliferation of certain species of fungi present in grain, trials in Argentina with damp grain stored in silo bags showed that fungi develop to the detriment of grain quality.",
              "It is therefore best to store grain at the recommended safe storage moisture content when placed into silo bags.",
              "Safe storage moisture content depends on weather conditions during the warmest period of storage at the geographic location of the silo bags.",
              "Recommended best management practices Before choosing to utilize silo bags, in addition to the economics, the following best management practices adapted from a list compiled by Purdue University Extension should be considered: Benefits of using silo bags Disadvantages of using silo bags"
