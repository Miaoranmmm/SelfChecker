    "query": "What is the most effective way to combat the stigma surrounding mental illness in society, and how can we promote empathy and understanding towards those who struggle with their mental health?",
    "response": "That's a very important and thoughtful question. There is no simple answer, but there are some strategies that can help reduce the stigma around mental illness and promote empathy and understanding towards those who struggle with their mental health. According to some sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^], some of these strategies are:\n\n- **Talk openly about mental health**. Sharing your own experiences or challenges with mental health, or listening to others who do, can help break the silence and shame that often surrounds mental illness. It can also help raise awareness and educate others about the realities and challenges of living with a mental health condition.\n- **Educate yourself and others**. Learning more about mental health conditions, their causes, symptoms, treatments and recovery can help dispel myths and stereotypes that fuel stigma. You can also correct misinformation or negative comments that you encounter in your daily life or on social media by sharing facts and personal stories.\n- **Be conscious of language**. The words we use to talk about mental health can have a powerful impact on how people perceive themselves and others. Avoid using terms like \"crazy\", \"psycho\", \"schizo\" or \"mental\" as insults or jokes, as they can be hurtful and demeaning to people with mental illness. Instead, use respectful and accurate language that acknowledges the personhood and dignity of those with mental health conditions.\n- **Encourage equality between physical and mental illness**. Mental illness is not a personal weakness or a character flaw, but a medical condition that affects millions of people around the world. Just like physical illness, mental illness deserves compassion, support and treatment without judgment or discrimination. You can help reduce stigma by treating people with mental illness with the same kindness and respect that you would treat someone with a physical illness.\n- **Show compassion for those with mental illness**. People with mental illness often face isolation, rejection and exclusion from their communities and society at large. You can help them feel less alone and more valued by reaching out to them, offering a listening ear, a hug, a smile or a friendly conversation. You can also volunteer or donate to organizations that provide services and advocacy for people with mental illness.\n- **Choose empowerment over shame**. Stigma can make people with mental illness feel ashamed of their condition and afraid to seek help. You can help them overcome this by empowering them to embrace their identity, strengths and potential. You can also encourage them to seek professional help when they need it, and support them in their recovery journey.\n\nThese are some of the ways that you can fight stigma and promote empathy towards people with mental health issues. I hope this helps you understand this topic better.",

              "Our study has further identified nuanced details on how these strategies can be carried out as well as possible areas of priority in the Singapore landscape.",
              "The stigma of living with a mental health condition has been described as being worse than the experience of the illness itself [1].",
              "The aversive reactions that members of the general population have towards people with mental illness is known as public stigma and can be understood in terms of (i) stereotypes, (ii) prejudice, and (iii) discrimination [2].",
              "Common stereotypes associated with people with mental health conditions are that they are dangerous, incompetent, and weak in character.",
              "Prejudice refers to the agreement with these stereotypes, while discrimination refers to behavioural reactions to these prejudices [3].",
              "Beyond the interpersonal manifestations of public stigma towards people with mental health conditions, societal-level conditions such as institutional policies and practices and cultural norms have also been found to be biased against people with mental health conditions, resulting in a lack of opportunities and resources being afforded to them [4].",
              "These socio-political disinclinations, known as structural stigma, result in people with mental health conditions being excluded from employment, living in unstable and unsafe conditions, being disqualified from health insurance, and being subjected to coercive hospitalisation and treatment [5,6].",
              "The deprivation of opportunities and poor-quality resources provided to those with mental health conditions have severe bearings, as evidenced by the gross overrepresentation of individuals with mental health conditions in the criminal justice system and among those living in poverty [7].",
              "People with mental health conditions also have significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates [8], and consequent to all the above, have a lower quality of life compared to the general population [9,10].",
              "Through repeated encounters with public and structural stigma, individuals with mental health conditions are inclined to internalise these reactions, a phenomenon known as self-stigma.",
              "A systematic review found that exposure to public stigma predicts self-stigma at a later time [11,12].",
              "A person\u2019s own stigmatizing views towards mental illness is associated with lower readiness to appraise his or her own symptoms as potentially indicating a mental health problem and thus reduces help-seeking behaviour [13].",
              "This could be because the individual seeks to avoid the label of mental illness for him- or herself [14], fathomably to guard themselves against the negative self-perceptions associated with it and the potential consequences of shame and reduced empowerment [15].",
              "Indeed, self-stigma decreases one\u2019s self-esteem and self-efficacy, leading to the \u201cwhy try effect\u201d, where people with mental health conditions question their worthiness and capability to pursue personal goals [16,17], leading to a loss of self-respect and increased shame and hopelessness [18,19].",
              "Over time, higher levels of self-stigma have been found to be associated with suicidal ideation [18,20].",
              "Due to these adverse effects of stigma, stigma-reduction is seen as a global public health priority [21,22,23,24].",
              "Anti-stigma programmes were traditionally conducted by or in substantial consultation with groups representing psychiatric expertise [25].",
              "However, several criticisms have been raised towards this approach in the recent years.",
              "First, the emphasis on medical understandings of mental health problems and the importance of adhering to psychiatric interventions have been criticised as fulfilling the psychiatric services agenda rather than the interest of people with mental health conditions and eclipsing inputs from other standpoints [3,26].",
              "Next, mental health professionals have been found to be just as likely to stigmatise those with mental health conditions [27,28,29].",

              "However, the effects of this intervention was short-term, highlighting our participants\u2019 assertion as well as supporting literature that stigma-reduction efforts should be continuous [57].",
              "While such planned interactions can be logistically challenging and encumber continuity of exposure, the evidence suggests that non-face-to-face contact can also deliver notable results [59].",

              "Thus, the revelation of a stigmatised identity from the celebrity with whom a parasocial bond already exists has a greater potential to reduce stigma than an encounter with someone new who reveals the same stigmatised identity [61].",
              "Indeed, an experimental study among undergraduate students showed that exposure to a video of popular pop singer, Demi Lovato, disclosing her experience with bipolar disorder (BD) significantly reduced negative stereotypes towards BD, and the higher the level of parasocial relationship, the lower their negative stereotypes of people with BD were [59].",
              "There is also potential for repeated exposure to mass-mediated content to effect long-term change, as demonstrated in a longitudinal study in which college students who were presented with filmed social contact every 2 months over a 12-month period showed significantly positive long-term outcomes (24 months follow-up) in terms of their behavioural intentions for social contact with PWLE compared to the control groups [62].",
              "Participants highlighted that this approach could serve well in a society such as Singapore, which has a celebrity culture.",
              "The third and fourth themes relate to advocacy by influential figures/groups and the legislation of anti-discriminatory laws.",
              "Legislative reform is designed to prohibit discrimination on any grounds, improve the protection of people with mental illness, and offer reasonable accommodations in areas such as employment, education, and housing.",

              "Corrigan [30] contrasted the service agenda in targeting stigma with the rights agenda, where the former is aimed at removing barriers to professional care, while the latter replaces disenfranchisement with affirming attitudes and behaviours.",
              "These agendas, which have different purposes and processes, may compete, and choices need to be made in allocating resources to work towards the chosen endpoint [30].",
              "The participants in the study commented that mental health awareness has increased in Singapore in the past couple of years, but these advancements have not caught on as quickly, particularly in workplaces.",

              "One component of stigma change identified in this study was the inclusion of practice guidelines on responding to disclosure appropriately, fairly, and sensitively in workplaces.",

              "Second, as the researchers were from the IMH, participants have may withheld their critical views of the mental health system and suggestions to improve it, as it was possible that they did not want to offend the researchers affiliated with the institution.",

              "While several positive steps have been taken towards de-stigmatisation, evaluation efforts for these initiatives are currently lacking.",
              "It is recommended that scientifically rigorous evaluations of these efforts be undertaken so that outcomes can be tested, and the initiatives can be continually improved.",
              "Further, PWLE should be included in future anti-stigma research as well as in the evaluation of these campaigns and programmes.",

              "The second element is identifying the techniques used to mislead or the fallacies that underlie the false arguments to refute forthcoming misinformation157,158.",
              "For example, a person might be taught that techniques used to mislead include selective use (\u2018cherry-picking\u2019) of data (for example, only showing temperatures from outlier years to create the illusion that global temperatures have dropped) or the use of fake experts (for example, scientists with no expertise in climate science).",

              "Post-inoculation talk is more likely to be negative than talk among non-inoculated people, which promotes misinformation resistance both within and between individuals because people\u2019s evaluations tend to weight negative information more strongly than positive information162.",

              "First, the most important element of a debunking correction is to provide a factual account that ideally includes an alternative explanation for why something happened85,86,99,102,184.",
              "For example, if a fire was thought to have been caused by negligence, then providing a causal alternative (\u2018there is evidence for arson\u2019) is more effective than a retraction (\u2018there was no negligence\u2019).",
              "In general, more detailed refutations work better than plain retractions that do not provide any detail on why the misinformation is incorrect92,100,112,113.",
              "It can be beneficial to lead with the correction rather than repeat the misinformation to prioritize the correct information and set a factual frame for the issue.",
              "However, a preprint that has not been peer-reviewed suggests that leading with the misinformation can be just as, or even more, effective if no pithy fact is available150.",
              "Second, the misinformation should be repeated to demonstrate how it is incorrect and to make the correction salient.",
              "However, the misinformation should be prefaced with a warning99,148 and repeated only once in order not to boost its familiarity unnecessarily104.",
              "It is also good to conclude by repeating and emphasizing the accurate information to reinforce the correction185.",
              "Third, even though credibility matters less for correction sources compared with misinformation sources88, corrections are ideally delivered by or associated with high-credibility sources116,117,118,119,120,186.",
              "There is also emerging evidence that corrections are more impactful when they come from a socially connected source (for example, a connection on social media) rather than a stranger187.",
              "Fourth, corrections should be paired with relevant social norms, including injunctive norms (\u2018protecting the vulnerable by getting vaccinated is the right thing to do\u2019) and descriptive norms (\u2018over 90% of parents are vaccinating their children\u2019)188, as well as expert consensus (\u2018doctors and medical societies around the world agree that vaccinations are important and safe\u2019)189,190,191,192.",
              "One study found a benefit to knowledge revision if corrective evidence was endorsed by many others on social media, thus giving the impression of normative backing193.",

              "Simple language and informative graphics can facilitate knowledge revision, especially if fact comprehension might be otherwise difficult or if the person receiving the correction has a strong tendency to counterargue194,195,196,197.",
              "When speaking directly to misinformed individuals, empathic communication should be used rather than wielding expertise to argue directives198,199.",
              "Finally, it has been suggested that worldview-threatening corrections can be made more palatable by concurrently providing an identity affirmation145,200,201.",
              "Identity affirmations involve a message or task (for example, writing a brief essay about one\u2019s strengths and values) that highlights important sources of self-worth.",
              "These exercises are assumed to protect and strengthen the correction recipient\u2019s self-esteem and the value of their identity, thereby reducing the threat associated with the correction and associated processing biases.",

              "Furthermore, even well-designed debunking interventions might not have long-lasting effects, thus requiring repeated intervention.",
              "Misinformation corrections might be especially important in social media contexts because they can reduce false beliefs not just in the target of the correction but among everyone that sees the correction \u2014 a process termed observational correction119.",

              "To prevent potential adverse effects on people\u2019s online behaviour, such as sharing of misleading content, gentle accuracy nudges that prompt people to consider the accuracy of the information they encounter or highlight the importance of sharing only true information might be preferable to public corrections that might be experienced as embarrassing or confrontational181,207.",
              "In sum, social media users should be aware that corrections can be effective in this arena and have the potential to reduce false beliefs in people they are connected with as well as bystanders.",

              "For instance, people must be aware that they might encounter not only relatively harmless misinformation, such as reporting errors, outdated information and satire, but also disinformation campaigns designed to instil fear or doubt, discredit individuals, and sow division2,26,223,224.",

              "These platforms include social media platforms such as YouTube, which are geared towards maximizing engagement even if this means promoting misinformation229, and traditional media outlets such as television news channels, where misinformation can negatively impact audiences.",

              "Although existing research has yielded valuable insights into how people generally process misinformation (many of which will translate across different contexts and cultures), an increased focus on diversification of samples and more robust methods is likely to provide a better appreciation of important contextual factors and nuanced cultural differences7,82,205,257,258,259,260,261,262,263.",
              "Second, most existing work has focused on explicit misinformation and text-based materials.",

Further, using twin data, we investigated the underlying genetic and environmental influences that may account for some of these associations.",
              "Social isolation is a state of estrangement, in which social connections are limited or absent.",
              "Loneliness, on the other hand, is a subjective feeling of distress, arising when social connections are perceived to be inadequate or unfulfilling [4\u20136].",
              "Crucially, although isolation and loneliness tend to co-occur, they can also be experienced independently of one another: it does not follow that isolated individuals necessarily feel lonely, nor does an abundance of social connections preclude one from experiencing loneliness [7, 8].",
              "Thus, although there is overlap between these two constructs, there are important conceptual distinctions between them.",
              "It is therefore important to incorporate measures of both isolation and loneliness, without treating them as interchangeable [5].",

              "Although the prevalence of loneliness varies with age, its association with depression remains stable across the lifespan [16, 17].",

              "Further, based on the conceptualisation of loneliness as an emotional state, in contrast to the more circumstantial nature of isolation, we expect that loneliness will have the more robust association with depressive symptoms. The associations between isolation and loneliness, and between loneliness and depression, may reflect common underlying genetic or environmental influences which contribute to the co-occurrence of these phenomena.",
              "Genetically-informative studies have estimated that approximately 40\u201350 % of the variance in loneliness is accounted for by genetic factors [20\u201323].",
              "The genetic contribution to loneliness has been represented in an evolutionary framework, in which loneliness is an adaptive response to social disconnection that provides the impetus to re-integrate with social groups [9].",
              "This suggests that social isolation is a situation that arises from the environment, and that it is the individual\u2019s response that is genetically influenced.",
              "However, social isolation itself shows a similar degree of genetic influence to loneliness [24], raising the possibility that some of the same heritable characteristics may be involved in both of these experiences.",
              "To date, however, no multivariate behavioural genetic studies have been carried out to estimate the extent to which the associations between isolation, loneliness and depression are explained by common genetic or environmental influences.",
              "Such evidence would be informative from a clinical practice point of view, as genetically-driven associations would suggest that interventions to reduce loneliness and associated depressive symptoms should take individuals\u2019 social perceptions into account rather than focusing efforts purely on increasing opportunities for social participation.",
              "The perception of being cut off from social groups makes individuals feel vulnerable, triggering a range of cognitive, behavioural and physiological responses geared towards self-protection [9].",
              "Thus, lonely individuals are inclined to be less trusting, to be more anxious and pessimistic, to perceive others around them more negatively and to approach social interactions in a defensive, hostile manner [9, 25, 26].",
              "Although such cognitive biases and behavioural styles may serve the adaptive purpose of distancing individuals from potential threats, the corollary of this is that lonely individuals may become further isolated by sabotaging their opportunities to develop positive social relationships.",
              "It is therefore possible that a genetic predisposition to these defensive patterns of thought and behaviour, reflected in the heritability of loneliness, may also contribute to social isolation.",
              "Based on this, we would expect to find a genetic correlation between social isolation and loneliness, reflecting the presence of common underlying genetic contributions to these constructs.",

              "This can be expressed as a percentage by dividing by the phenotypic correlation.",
              "The proportion of the association between social isolation and loneliness explained by genetic influences was 65 %.",
              "When looking at loneliness and depression, genetic influences accounted for 55 % of this association, with the remainder accounted for by the non-shared environment.",
              "In the present investigation, we built on previous studies in disentangling the constructs of social isolation and loneliness, using data from a nationally-representative longitudinal cohort.",
              "Young adults who were socially isolated experienced greater feelings of loneliness, and were also more likely to grapple with depression, suggesting that social relationships confer benefits for mental health over and above subjective feelings of connectedness, such as reducing the effects of stress [42].",
              "However, young adults\u2019 feelings of loneliness were more strongly associated with their experience of depressive symptoms than were reports of social isolation, a finding consistent with previous studies [10, 11, 15].",
              "Using a genetically-sensitive design, we detected genetic contributions to social isolation, loneliness and depression, and a strong genetic overlap between these phenotypes.",
              "We found a heritability estimate for loneliness which is in line with those found in previous behavioural genetics studies [20\u201322].",
              "The heritability of loneliness has been described as reflecting a genetic propensity to experiencing psychological pain in conditions of social disconnection [9].",
              "However, we also found that social isolation itself\u2014ostensibly an environmental exposure\u2014showed a similar degree of genetic influence to loneliness.",
              "The presence of genetic influences on measures of the environment is a robust finding in behavioural genetics research [43, 44], and in the case of social isolation may reflect heritable characteristics that predispose individuals to experience negative interactions with others, or to self-select into solitary patterns of behaviour.",
              "The absence of shared environmental influences indicates that the environmental exposures contributing to isolation and loneliness are unique to individuals rather than experienced by multiple siblings within a family.",
              "We expanded further on previous findings on the heritability of loneliness by using a multivariate behavioural genetic design to test the hypothesis that social isolation, loneliness and depression would share common underlying genetic influences.",
              "Consistent with our expectations, the heritabilities of isolation and loneliness were highly correlated, and this genetic correlation accounted for approximately two-thirds of the phenotypic overlap between these two constructs, indicating that the co-occurrence of loneliness with social isolation is driven to a large extent by the same heritable characteristics.",
              "Some lonely individuals have a tendency to adopt negative perceptions and expectations of others, which in turn can harm their social interactions and drive others away, thus exacerbating their isolation [25, 26].",
              "Thus, the same heritable traits that can make individuals liable to becoming isolated in the first place may also dispose them to respond to their feelings of disconnection in maladaptive ways, contributing to this self-reinforcing cycle between isolation and loneliness.",
              "A smaller part of the correlation was explained by environmental factors, which may reflect the influence of broader socioeconomic and cultural forces that shape the context in which social relationships are formed [45].",
              "Furthermore, we found that the association between loneliness and depression was explained both by genetic and non-shared environmental influences.",
              "Although heritable personality traits such as neuroticism are correlated with both of these phenomena, other research shows that they do not explain the association between them [9, 46].",
              "Instead, the genetic overlap may reflect a heritable predisposition to cognitive biases and negative attributional styles that are characteristics of both loneliness and depression [47].",
              "Non-shared environmental influences, meanwhile, may be reflective of peer influences or life events.",
              "The cross-sectional nature of the data does not allow the role of mediating variables to be tested;",
              "further longitudinal research will therefore be valuable in identifying potential mechanisms underlying the associations found in this study.",
              "The latent factor approach in this study does not yield information about which genes play a role in the associations under investigation.",
              "However, a growing body of research in this area has yielded some promising findings [23].",
              "Studies of gene-environment interactions have found that the associations between loneliness and measures of family support were moderated by variants of genes including the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) [48], the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) [49], and the corticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) [50].",
              "Another study showed attenuation of the relationship between loneliness and depression in the presence of a specific apolipoprotein (APOE) allele [51].",
              "Replication of these findings in large samples and research in the growing field of epigenetics will help to further elucidate the genetic underpinnings of social isolation and loneliness.",
              "Although males were on average more isolated and females more depressed, no sex differences were found for loneliness.",
              "This is consistent with previous studies using the UCLA Loneliness Scale [52].",
              "However, the association between isolation and loneliness was stronger among females.",
              "Previous studies suggest that friendships between females are characterised by greater amounts of emotional sharing in comparison to male friendships, which emphasise shared activities [53, 54].",
              "To the extent that females invest more in the emotionally-supportive qualities of social relationships, this may leave them particularly susceptible to feelings of loneliness in the absence of such relationships, while males may experience this to a somewhat lesser extent.",
              "Nonetheless, it is important to note that for both males and females the association between isolation and loneliness was well below unity, indicating that non-isolated individuals may still feel lonely.",
              "Furthermore, the association between loneliness and depression was equally strong for males and females, suggesting that loneliness is a similarly distressing experience for both males and females.",
              "In the present study, we operationalised social isolation as the lower end of a distribution of social support.",
              "Isolation has been measured in numerous others ways in different studies, including cohabitation, marital status, social network size and participation in social activities [5, 6, 11, 15, 34, 55].",
              "There is little consensus as to the best or most comprehensive measure of isolation, and some measures may be more appropriate than others depending on the age group under investigation.",
              "For example, data on living arrangements collected at age 18 indicated that nearly all of the participants in this study were cohabiting either with family members, partners or flatmates.",
              "We therefore did not consider living alone to be a suitable measure of isolation among this age group.",
              "Other indicators of isolation were not available at age 18;",
              "however, in a previous study we derived a measure of childhood social isolation based on mother and teacher report when participants were aged 12 [24].",
              "Repeating our analyses using this variable yielded much the same pattern of results, with 41 % of variance in social isolation accounted for by genetic influences, and approximately three-quarters of its phenotypic association with age-18 loneliness accounted for by the genetic correlation.",
              "We are therefore confident in our selection of low social support as a proxy for isolation for the purpose of this study.",
              "Nonetheless, it should be acknowledged that social support is not the only feature of social relationships that may have implications for mental health outcomes [45].",
              "Furthermore, there may be individual differences in the way participants rate the amount of support available to them, and therefore this measure cannot be assumed to be fully objective in nature.",
              "Future studies should therefore aim to replicate our findings using measures of isolation that take into account other aspects of social networks.",
              "Some methodological limitations in our study merit acknowledgement.",
              "Firstly, as all data were measured at the same age, our results do not permit conclusions to be drawn about the direction of the associations.",
              "Social isolation and loneliness may reinforce one another via maladaptive appraisal and coping styles, and similarly, individuals with symptoms of depression may become withdrawn and isolate themselves, feeding back into feelings of loneliness;",
              "thus, the observed associations may be bidirectional in nature.",
              "A second limitation is the use of self-report for all measures in the present study.",
              "It is not possible to rule out the presence of a reporting bias, whereby individuals with low mood are more likely to rate their social relationships more negatively.",
              "Thirdly, measuring social isolation and loneliness in a sample of twins may be confounded by the fact that each participant, by definition, had a sibling.",
              "Consequently, social isolation and loneliness may be underestimated by twin data.",
              "With regard to clinical implications, the shared genetic origins of loneliness and depression suggest potential targets for treatment and prevention.",
              "Although the cross-sectional nature of the data does not permit any developmental hypotheses to be drawn, our findings are consistent with prior studies suggesting that interventions to decrease feelings of loneliness can be important to reduce depressive symptoms [12].",
              "Given that loneliness can be experienced even without social isolation, simply increasing individuals\u2019 amount of social contact may be insufficient for improving outcomes.",
              "Consistent with this, a meta-analysis of interventions suggests that addressing negative social cognitions shows greater promise as a strategy to reduce loneliness, compared to interventions focused on increasing social contact or support [56, 57].",
              "More broadly, relationship-based interventions such as interpersonal therapy are effective in reducing depressive symptoms in young people [58].",
              "The present study provides new insights into the links between social connection and mental health.",
              "Isolation and loneliness are strongly related constructs, and both show similar degrees of heritability.",
              "However, from a research and clinical practice perspective, it is important not to treat these constructs as interchangeable.",
              "Lonely individuals are vulnerable to depression irrespective of their actual degree of social support.",
              "Furthermore, the aetiological influences underlying these associations point to the role of common genetic characteristics in driving the co-occurrence of these experiences.",
              "To further understand the mechanisms involved, future research should investigate the role of mediating variables and gene\u2013environment interplay in the relationship between isolation, loneliness and psychopathology.",

              "Background: Reducing the stigma surrounding mental illness is a global public health priority.",
              "Traditionally, anti-stigma campaigns were led by mental health professionals/organisations and had an emphasis on increasing mental health literacy.",
              "More recently, it has been argued that people with lived experience have much to contribute in terms of extending and strengthening these efforts.",
              "The purpose of this paper was to elicit views and suggestions from people with lived experience (PWLE) as well as from informal caregivers of people with mental health conditions, on effective strategies to combat the stigma surrounding mental illness.",
              "Methods: Six focus group discussions (FGDs) were carried out with PWLE recruited at outpatient services at the Institute of Mental Health, Singapore, and five FGDs were carried out with informal caregivers who responded to advertisements for the study between March and November 2018.",
              "In all, the sample comprised 42 PWLE and 31 caregivers.",
              "All the FGDs were transcribed verbatim and were analysed using thematic analysis.",
              "A pragmatic approach was adopted for the study, and the researchers did not assume any particular philosophical orientation.",
              "Results: Four overarching themes depicting strategies to combat stigma were identified through thematic analysis.",
              "They were (1) raising mental health awareness, (2) social contact, (3) advocacy by influential figures or groups, and (4) the legislation of anti-discriminatory laws.",
              "Conclusions: These strategies were in line with approaches that have been used internationally to disrupt the process of stigma.",
              "Our study has further identified nuanced details on how these strategies can be carried out as well as possible areas of priority in the Singapore landscape.",
              "The stigma of living with a mental health condition has been described as being worse than the experience of the illness itself [1].",
              "The aversive reactions that members of the general population have towards people with mental illness is known as public stigma and can be understood in terms of (i) stereotypes, (ii) prejudice, and (iii) discrimination [2].",
              "Common stereotypes associated with people with mental health conditions are that they are dangerous, incompetent, and weak in character.",
              "Prejudice refers to the agreement with these stereotypes, while discrimination refers to behavioural reactions to these prejudices [3].",
              "Beyond the interpersonal manifestations of public stigma towards people with mental health conditions, societal-level conditions such as institutional policies and practices and cultural norms have also been found to be biased against people with mental health conditions, resulting in a lack of opportunities and resources being afforded to them [4].",
              "These socio-political disinclinations, known as structural stigma, result in people with mental health conditions being excluded from employment, living in unstable and unsafe conditions, being disqualified from health insurance, and being subjected to coercive hospitalisation and treatment [5,6].",
              "The deprivation of opportunities and poor-quality resources provided to those with mental health conditions have severe bearings, as evidenced by the gross overrepresentation of individuals with mental health conditions in the criminal justice system and among those living in poverty [7].",
              "People with mental health conditions also have significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates [8], and consequent to all the above, have a lower quality of life compared to the general population [9,10].",
              "Through repeated encounters with public and structural stigma, individuals with mental health conditions are inclined to internalise these reactions, a phenomenon known as self-stigma.",
              "A systematic review found that exposure to public stigma predicts self-stigma at a later time [11,12].",
              "A person\u2019s own stigmatizing views towards mental illness is associated with lower readiness to appraise his or her own symptoms as potentially indicating a mental health problem and thus reduces help-seeking behaviour [13].",
              "This could be because the individual seeks to avoid the label of mental illness for him- or herself [14], fathomably to guard themselves against the negative self-perceptions associated with it and the potential consequences of shame and reduced empowerment [15].",
              "Indeed, self-stigma decreases one\u2019s self-esteem and self-efficacy, leading to the \u201cwhy try effect\u201d, where people with mental health conditions question their worthiness and capability to pursue personal goals [16,17], leading to a loss of self-respect and increased shame and hopelessness [18,19].",
              "Over time, higher levels of self-stigma have been found to be associated with suicidal ideation [18,20].",
              "Due to these adverse effects of stigma, stigma-reduction is seen as a global public health priority [21,22,23,24].",
              "Anti-stigma programmes were traditionally conducted by or in substantial consultation with groups representing psychiatric expertise [25].",
              "However, several criticisms have been raised towards this approach in the recent years.",
              "First, the emphasis on medical understandings of mental health problems and the importance of adhering to psychiatric interventions have been criticised as fulfilling the psychiatric services agenda rather than the interest of people with mental health conditions and eclipsing inputs from other standpoints [3,26].",
              "Next, mental health professionals have been found to be just as likely to stigmatise those with mental health conditions [27,28,29].",
              "Thus, is has been argued that the professional expertise that mental health professionals have in providing mental health services may be insufficient in impacting the social spheres in which stigma operate, and it may be timely for them to move to a supporting role [30].",
              "In recent years, anti-stigma programmes have involved people with lived experience to allow direct or parasocial interactions between target audiences and people with mental health conditions.",
              "Contact-based interventions have demonstrated the clearest evidence in reducing stigmatising attitudes, desire for social distancing and discrimination [31,32,33].",
              "Contact-based interventions typically involve brief contact between members of a majority group and a stranger representing the stigmatized population who is quite different from a naturally occurring contact.",
              "Stigma is reduced by providing an opportunity for interpersonal contact between people who have mental illness and individuals who may hold stigma towards them.",
              "A key ingredient of contact-based interventions is the delivery of testimonies by service users [34].",
              "The efficacy of contact-based education has led to calls for collaborations with individuals with mental health conditions to offer their experiential wisdom in challenging stigma, representing the voice of those who struggle with mental health difficulties and shedding light on blind spots and gaps in previous strategies [3,35].",
              "Corrigan asserted that just as disability rights groups have adopted the slogan of \u201cno policy or action should be taken about a group without full participation of that group\u201d, the same should be applied to alleviate mental health stigma [30].",
              "Additionally, while we have thus far described the negative processes that arise from stigma, there are people with mental health conditions who do not agree with the hackneyed stereotypes and respond with indignation that seems to empower and energise them to advocate for changes to the ways in which they are treated [2].",
              "Their inputs towards initiatives that are aimed at improving service delivery and de-stigmatisation programmes have been found to lead to novel results and have been described as a strength of those programmes [35,36].",
              "Singapore is a small, highly urbanised, multi-cultural country located at the Southern tip of the Malayan Peninsula.",

              "Stigma towards mental illness remains prevalent in Singapore today.",
              "An earlier nationwide survey revealed that 38.",
              "3% of the population believed that people with mental illness are dangerous, and 49.",
              "6% felt that people need to be protected from psychiatric patients [38].",
              "A decade later, another population survey, which used a vignette-based approach, reported that 50.",
              "8% of respondents indicated that mental illness was a sign of personal weakness, 42.",
              "8% were unwilling to work closely with a person with mental health conditions on a job, and 70.",
              "2% were unwilling to have a person with mental health conditions marry into their family [39].",
              "A recent qualitative study of daily encounters of personal stigma reported themes such as social exclusion, subjection to contemptuous treatment, and rejection by employers following the declaration of a mental health condition [40].",
              "Anti-stigma activities in Singapore have been conducted by the state psychiatric institution, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), the National Council of Social Service, the Health Promotion Board (statutory boards), and non-profit organisations such as the Singapore Association for Mental Health and Silver Ribbon Singapore, who have the collective aims of improving mental health literacy, access to mental health care, and improving the reintegration of people with mental health conditions into the community [41,42].",
              "However, the involvement of individuals with mental health conditions in anti-stigma campaigns is lacking.",
              "The purpose of this paper was thus to elicit views and suggestions from people with lived experience (PWLE) and informal caregivers of people with mental health conditions on effective strategies to combat stigma.",
              "The present study is part of a larger study that aimed to examine the nature of mental illness stigma in Singapore from the perspectives of five stakeholder groups, namely PWLE, informal caregivers, members of the general public, professionals working in mental health settings, and policy makers.",
              "The main purpose of this research was to provide actionable knowledge.",
              "It took a pragmatic approach common in health services research and did not assume any particular methodological orientation [43].",
              "Only data from PWLE and caregivers were used in this analysis.",
              "The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board.",
              "Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before initiating study related procedures.",
              "PWLE and caregivers were recruited through referrals by their clinicians or self-referral by learning about the study though poster advertisements placed in waiting areas at the IMH outpatient clinics.",
              "The IMH is Singapore\u2019s largest provider of mental health care, providing pharmacological and psychosocial treatments as well as psychosocial rehabilitation for a range of subspecialties, including child and adolescent psychiatry, affective disorders, and psychosis.",
              "It has also spearheaded mental health education and anti-stigma events for the public.",
              "All the participants were required to be Singapore citizens and permanent residents, aged 21 years old and above, and could not be a student or professional from the mental health field.",
              "PWLE recruitment was limited to two types of psychiatric diagnoses, mood and psychotic disorders, to attain a more homogenous account of encounters with stigma.",
              "The groups were also separated by diagnosis to facilitate the identification of members in a group with each other and to provide comfort when expressing themselves.",
              "In all, six Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted with PWLE between March to May 2018 (three with individuals with mood disorders, three with those with psychosis-related disorders).",
              "Referred and self-referred PWLE were deemed clinically stable by their treating clinicians and were able to provide informed consent.",
              "Although the poster advertisements indicated that the study sought caregivers of individuals with psychosis-related or mood disorders, no attempt was made to confirm the diagnosis of their care recipients with the treating clinicians.",
              "The caregiver group was independent of the PWLE group.",
              "Unlike the PWLE FGDs, the caregivers were not separated based on the diagnosis of their care recipient.",
              "As the initial FGDs did not identify any issue with this approach, the team carried out the rest of the FGDs in a similar manner.",

              "CMJG, OWJ, GTTH, SS, and MS took turns as note-takers in the different FGDs.",
              "After individual consent was taken to participate in the research and to audio-record the session, each participant filled out a sociodemographic form that collated information about age, gender, education level, ethnicity, and brief information about their illness (for PWLE) or caregiving relationship (for caregivers), and the completed form was returned to the facilitator.",
              "Participants were assured that all of the data collected from them would be kept confidential, the transcripts would be de-identified such that names and other identifying features would be omitted, the audio-recording would be deleted after transcription, and that there were no correct or incorrect answers before the discussion commenced.",
              "The experienced facilitators used a topic guide comprising open-ended questions that had been developed by the research team so that the data collected across the various FGDs would be as uniform as possible.",
              "Few specific questions were designed to elicit information that could be best addressed by a particular target group.",
              "The topic guide covered areas of mental illness stigma such as encounters of stigma and reasons for stigma.",

              "The team brainstormed the questions to answer the objectives of the research, and one researcher drafted the questioning route, rephrased, and reordered the questions to form a logical flow.",
              "The draft was circulated to the rest of the team, and suggestions were incorporated.",
              "The team aimed to keep the final total number of questions between 10\u201312.",
              "Decisions to omit questions were based on importance in addressing the research objectives, with final decisions being made by the lead investigator (MS).",

              "The authors hypothesized that a high level of perceived discrimination, little sense of identification with the group of people with mental illness, and a high level of perceived legitimacy of discrimination lead to self-stigma.",

              "People with mental illness often face a double problem: symptoms of their mental illness and public stigma (1).",
              "Some people with mental illness accept the common prejudices and lose self-esteem, resulting in self-stigmatization (2) (hereafter referred to as self-stigma).",
              "The fact that some develop low self-esteem while others remain indifferent to stigma or react with empowerment and righteous anger has been called the \"paradox of self-stigma and mental illness\" (3).",
              "Corrigan and colleagues (3) recently hypothesized that two variables influence the personal response to public stigma: perceived legitimacy of discrimination and group identification (3).",
              "If people with mental illness perceive discrimination as legitimate, they are likely to have low self-esteem.",
              "If, however, they regard discrimination as unfair, their reaction to perceived discrimination will depend on the level of identification with the group of people with mental illness.",
              "If they do not identify with this group, they are likely to remain indifferent, because they do not believe that public stigma refers to them.",
              "If, however, they show a strong sense of group identification, they are likely to react with empowerment and righteous anger.",
              "The study reported here was designed to empirically test this model of personal response to stigma associated with mental illness.",
              "Among people with mental illness, two further issues need to be taken into account.",
              "First, in addition to self-stigma, depression is also likely to affect self-esteem and empowerment.",
              "Second, people with different mental disorders may react differently to public stigma.",
              "Women with borderline personality disorder are particularly likely to frequently experience public stigma and discrimination, because their disorder usually begins in early adulthood, has a chronic course, and often leads to multiple labeling processes, such as repeated psychiatric hospitalizations and visible scars.",
              "Women with social phobia are a particularly relevant comparison group, because public stigma is likely to be less intense than for women with borderline personality disorder, but fears of being humiliated and devalued constitute a core characteristic of social phobia as specified by DSM-IV criteria.",
              "These fears are likely to render individuals with social phobia vulnerable to self-stigma.",

              "To test the model of personal response to stigma among all 90 participants, we calculated two multiple linear regressions with self-esteem and empowerment as respective dependent variables and with perceived discrimination, perceived legitimacy of discrimination, and group identification as independent variables (Table 2).",
              "To control for depression and index diagnosis, both were included as independent variables in the two regressions.",
              "After level of depression and index diagnosis were controlled for, low perceived discrimination and low perceived legitimacy of discrimination predicted high self-esteem and empowerment.",
              "The level of group identification did not significantly predict self-esteem or empowerment (Table 2).",
              "We were also interested in examining whether interaction terms of the independent variables explained additional variance in self-esteem or empowerment.",
              "Therefore, we calculated three product terms following a z-standardization, because scaling differed between the respective variables: perceived discrimination by perceived legitimacy, perceived discrimination by group identification, and perceived legitimacy by group identification.",
              "When each of the three variables was included as an additional independent variable in the regressions on self-esteem and empowerment, none of the interaction terms significantly predicted self-esteem or empowerment, nor did the adjusted R2 of the regressions increase by more than .",

              "(This approach to hierarchical testing of interaction terms in multiple regressions has been described elsewhere [10].)",
              "Both depression and perceived discrimination seem to render individuals with mental illness vulnerable to low self-esteem and low empowerment\u2014that is, to self-stigma.",
              "Our results suggest that low perceived legitimacy of discrimination may protect the self-esteem of people with mental illness and encourage them to feel more empowered.",
              "These results in part confirm the model of Corrigan and colleagues (3).",
              "As hypothesized, low perceived discrimination and low perceived legitimacy of discrimination appear to be protective against self-stigma.",
              "However, the hypothesis that group identification is related to high self-esteem and empowerment was not borne out in our study.",
              "Unfortunately, this negative finding indicates that there may be no protective in-group bias among people with mental illness as it exists in other stigmatized minority groups (11).",
              "We could also not confirm the hypothesis of Corrigan and coworkers (3) of an interaction between perceived legitimacy of discrimination and group identification.",
              "Our finding of nearly identical patterns in the regression analyses for self-esteem and empowerment is plausible given that empowerment and low self-esteem resulting from self-stigma can be seen as opposite poles on a continuum.",
              "Perceived discrimination did not differ between the two diagnostic groups, probably because women with borderline personality disorder and women with social phobia are equally familiar with public stereotypes.",
              "However, although the groups were similar in the level of perceived legitimacy of discrimination, group identification was stronger among women with borderline personality disorder.",
              "This finding draws attention to the fact that individuals with different disorders may differ on variables that are relevant to the process of self-stigma.",
              "This difference corresponds well to the finding that public stigma differs for different disorders (12,13), which may in turn contribute to different processes of self-stigma.",
              "However, borderline personality disorder and social phobia are less well known mental illnesses;",
              "therefore public stereotypes that may affect self-stigma processes are less clear.",
              "This preliminary study has several limitations.",
              "First, cross-sectional analyses limit conclusions with regard to causality\u2014that is, we cannot exclude the possibility that low self-esteem may lead to increased self-stigma.",
              "Larger samples adequate for structural equation modeling and longitudinal studies are necessary to better understand interactions and causality.",
              "Longitudinal studies in therapeutic settings may inform us whether perceived legitimacy of discrimination\u2014and as a consequence self-stigma\u2014decreases as a result of certain interventions, for example, during cognitive-behavioral therapy that focuses on self-stigma or during successful pharmacologic treatment of depression.",
              "Second, our findings need to be replicated among individuals with other mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and depression, to further examine possible differences between individuals with different disorders.",
              "Nevertheless, this study compared a group of women with borderline personality disorder, who are likely to be heavily stigmatized, and women with social phobia, who are less likely to encounter stigmatization.",
              "Finally, high rates of comorbid disorders among women with borderline personality disorder may have confounded the findings.",
              "On the other hand, comorbid disorders are a clinical reality in borderline personality disorder.",
              "Because all the participants in our study were women, our sample is more homogeneous, but possible gender differences in the reaction to public stigma remain unclear and should be studied in future investigations.",
              "Future research should use a comprehensive assessment of self-stigma and its components, including coping orientations and emotional reactions (14).",
              "To reduce self-stigma and increase a sense of empowerment among people with mental illness, we need to better understand why individuals react differently to public stigma.",
              "This study provides initial empirical evidence that perceived discrimination and perceived legitimacy of discrimination have an impact on the personal response to public stigma and that individuals with different disorders may react differently.",
              "A better understanding of the factors that protect against self-stigma may enable us to help individuals with mental illness avoid the loss of self-esteem and empowerment that results from self-stigma.",

              "In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that an estimated 25 percent of the worldwide population is affected by a mental or behavioral disorder at some time during their lives.",
              "This mental and behavioral health issue is believed to contribute to 12 percent of the worldwide burden of disease and is projected to increase to 15 percent by the year 2020 (Hugo, Boshoff, Traut, Zungu-Dirwayi, & Stein, 2003).",
              "Within the United States, mental and behavioral health conditions affect approximately 57 million adults (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2006).",
              "Despite the high prevalence of these conditions, recognized treatments have shown effectiveness in mitigating the problem and improving individual functioning in society.",
              "Nonetheless, research suggests that (1) individuals who are in need of care often do not seek services, and (2) those that begin receiving care frequently do not complete the recommended treatment plan (Corrigan, 2004).",
              "For example, it has been estimated that less than 40 percent of individuals with severe mental illnesses receive consistent mental health treatment throughout the year (Kessler, Berglund, Bruce, Koch, Laska, Leaf, et al, 2001).",
              "There are several potential reasons for why, given a high prevalence of mental health and drug use conditions, there is much less participation in treatment.",
              "Plausible explanations may include (1) that those with mental health or drug use conditions are disabled enough by their condition that they are not able to seek treatment, or (2) that they are not able to identify their own condition and therefore do not seek needed services.",

              "In order to understand how stigma interferes in the lives of individuals with mental health and drug use conditions, it is essential to examine current definitions, theory, and research in this area.",
              "The definitions and dimensions of stigma are a basis for understanding the theory and epistemology of the three main \u2018levels\u2019 of stigma (social stigma, self-stigma, and health professional stigma).",
              "The most established definition regarding stigma is written by Erving Goffman (1963) in his seminal work: Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity.",
              "Goffman (1963) states that stigma is \u201can attribute that is deeply discrediting\u201d that reduces someone \u201cfrom a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted one\u201d (p.",

              "In the social work literature, Dudley (2000), working from Goffman\u2019s initial conceptualization, defined stigma as stereotypes or negative views attributed to a person or groups of people when their characteristics or behaviors are viewed as different from or inferior to societal norms. Due to its use in social work literature, Dudley\u2019s (2000) definition provides an excellent stance from which to develop an understanding of stigma.",

              "Stigma is relevant in other contexts such as towards individuals of varied backgrounds including race, gender, and sexual orientation.",
              "Thus, it is important to provide a definition of mental disorders, which also include drug use disorders, so that it can be understood in relationship to stigma.",
              "While each mental health and drug use disorder has a precise definition, the often cited and widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Ed.",

              "While this definition provides a consistent base from which to begin understanding how stigma impacts individuals with mental health and drug use disorders, it is important to recognize the inherent danger in relying too heavily on specific mental health diagnoses as precise definitions (Corrigan, 2007), which is why the term is being used just as a basis for understanding in this context.",
              "The next important step is to understand the constructs underlying the concept of stigma.",
              "These constructs detail the multiple pathways through which stigma can develop.",
              "Building from Goffman\u2019s initial conceptualization, Jones and colleagues (1984) identified six dimensions of stigma.",

              "Jones et al, 1984).",
              "In addition, Corrigan and colleagues (2001;",
              "2000) identified dimensions of stability, controllability, and pity.",
              "It is important to understand that these dimensions can either present independently or simultaneously to create stigma.",
              "Further, stigma is more than a combination of these elements impacting each person as an individual, since stigma is believed to be common in the structural framework of society (Feldman & Crandall, 2007).",
              "The first dimension of stigma is peril \u2013 otherwise known as dangerousness.",
              "Peril is often considered an important aspect in stigma development, and it is frequently cited in the research literature (Corrigan, et al, 2001;",

              "Angermeyer & Matschinger, 1996).",
              "In this instance, the general public perceives those with mental disorders as frightening, unpredictable, and strange (Lundberg, Hansson, Wentz, & Bjorkman, 2007).",
              "Corrigan (2004) also suggests that fear and discomfort arise as a result of the social cues attributed to individuals.",
              "Social cues can be evidenced by psychiatric symptoms, awkward physical appearance or social-skills, and through labels (Corrigan, 2004;",
              "Link, Cullen, Frank, & Wozniak, 1987;",
              "Corrigan, 2007).",
              "This particular issue highlights the dimension of aesthetics or the displeasing nature of mental disorders (Jones, et al, 1984).",
              "When society attributes, upon a person or group of people, perceived behaviors that do not adhere to the expected social norms, discomfort can be created.",
              "This often leads to the generalization of the connection between abnormal behavior and mental illness, which may result in labeling and avoidance.",
              "This also may be why society continues to avoid those with mental and behavioral disorders whenever possible (Corrigan, Markowitz, Watson, Rowan, & Kubiak, 2003).",
              "Another dimension of stigma that is often discussed in the research on stigma is origin.",

              "This has direct implications for the dimension of controllability (Corrigan, et al, 2001).",
              "Within this dimension, it is often believed in society that mental and behavioral disorders are personally controllable and if individuals cannot get better on their own, they are seen to lack personal effort (Crocker, 1996), are blamed for their condition, and seen as personally responsible (Corrigan, et al, 2001).",
              "A recent report by Feldman and Crandall (2007), found that individuals with disorders such as pedophilia and cocaine dependence were much more stigmatized than those with disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder.",
              "This supports the controllability hypothesis in which pedophilia and cocaine dependence could be viewed as more controllable in society than a disorder believed to be caused by a traumatic experience (PTSD).",
              "It also supports the pity dimension, in which disorders that are pitied to a greater degree are often less stigmatized (Corrigan, et al, 2000;",
              "Corrigan, et al, 2001).",
              "In this case, individuals within a culture or society may have more sympathy for disorders that are perceived as less controllable (Corrigan, et al, 2001).",
              "Concealability, or visibility of the illness, is a dimension of stigma that parallels controllability, but also provides other insight into the stigmatization of mental and behavioral disorders.",
              "Crocker (1996) suggests that stigmatized attributes such as race can be easily identified, and are less concealable, allowing society to differentiate and stigmatize based on the visibility of the person.",
              "This is supported by research that shows that society attributes more stigmatizing stereotypes towards disorders such as schizophrenia, which generally have more visible symptoms, compared to others such as major depression (Angermeyer & Matschinger, 2005;",
              "Lundberg, et al, 2007).",
              "The final three dimensions, course, stability, and disruptiveness, also may have some similarities among each other and compared to the others presented.",
              "Course and stability question how likely the person with the disability is to recover and/or benefit from treatment (Corrigan, et al, 2001;",
              "Jones, et al, 1984).",
              "Further the disruptiveness dimension assesses how much a mental or behavioral disorder may impact relationships or success in society.",
              "While disorders are frequently associated with an increased risk for poverty, lower socioeconomic status and lower levels of education (Kohn, Dohrenwend, & Mirotznik, 1998), the stability and disruptiveness of the conditions have implications as to whether an individual will be able to hold down a successful job and engage in healthy relationships, as evidenced by differences in stigma based on social class status.",
              "This demonstrates that if disorders are less disruptive, in which case they may be perceived as more stable, they are also less stigmatized (Corrigan, et al, 2001).",
              "This also expresses that some flexibility exists within each type of mental or behavioral disorder, as each diagnosed person is not stigmatized to the same extent (Crocker, 1999).",

              "First, stigmatized attitudes and beliefs towards individuals with mental health and drug use disorders are often in the form of social stigma, which is structural within the general public.",
              "Second, social stigma, or even the perception that social stigma exists, can become internalized by a person resulting in what is often called self-stigma.",
              "Finally, another, less studied level of stigma is that which is held among health professionals toward their clients.",

              "Structural means that stigma is a belief held by a large faction of society in which persons with the stigmatized condition are less equal or are part of an inferior group.",
              "In this context, stigma is embedded in the social framework to create inferiority.",
              "This belief system may result in unequal access to treatment services or the creation of policies that disproportionately and differentially affect the population.",
              "Social stigma can also cause disparities in access to basic services and needs such as renting an apartment.",
              "Several distinct schools of thought have contributed to the understanding of how social stigma develops and plays out in society.",
              "Unfortunately, to this point, social work has offered limited contributions to this literature.",
              "Nonetheless, one of the leading disciplines of stigma research has been social psychology.",
              "Stigma development in most social psychology research focuses on social identity resulting from cognitive, behavioral, and affective processes (Yang, Kleinman, Link, Phelan, Lee, & Good, 2007).",
              "Researchers in social psychology often suggest that there are three specific models of public stigmatization.",
              "These include socio-cultural, motivational, and social cognitive models (Crocker & Lutsky, 1986;",
              "Corrigan, 1998;",
              "Corrigan, et al, 2001).",
              "The socio-cultural model suggests that stigma develops to justify social injustices (Crocker & Lutsky, 1986).",
              "For instance, this may occur as a way for society to identify and label individuals with mental and behavioral illnesses as unequal.",
              "Second, the motivational model focuses on the basic psychological needs of individuals (Crocker & Lutsky, 1986).",
              "One example of this model may be that since persons with mental and behavioral disorders are often in lower socio-economic groups, they are inferior.",
              "Finally, the social cognitive model attempts to make sense of basic society using a cognitive framework (Corrigan, 1998), such that a person with a mental disorder would be labeled in one category and differentiated from non-ill persons.",
              "Most psychologists including Corrigan and colleagues (2001) prefer the social cognitive model to explain and understand the concept of stigma.",
              "One such understanding of this perspective \u2013 Attribution Theory \u2013 is related to three specific dimensions of stigma including stability, controllability, and pity (Corrigan, et al, 2001) that were discussed earlier.",
              "Using this framework, a recent study by these researchers found that the public often stigmatizes mental and behavioral disorders to a greater degree than physical disorders.",
              "In addition, this research found stigma variability based on the public\u2019s \u201cattributions.",
              "\u201d For example, cocaine dependence was perceived as the most controllable whereas \u2018mental retardation\u2019 was seen as least stable and both therefore received the most severe ratings in their corresponding stigma category (Corrigan, et al, 2001).",
              "These findings suggest that combinations of attributions may signify varying levels of stigmatized beliefs.",
              "Sociologists have also heavily contributed to the stigma literature.",
              "These theories have generally been seen through the lens of social interaction and social regard.",
              "The first of these theorists was Goffman (1963) who believed that individuals move between more or less \u2018stigmatized\u2019 categories depending on their knowledge and disclosure of their stigmatizing condition.",
              "These socially constructed categories parallel Lemert\u2019s (2000) discussion on social reaction theory.",
              "In this theory, two social categories of deviance are created including primary deviance, believing that people with mental and behavioral disorders are not acting within the norms of society, and secondary deviance, deviance that develops after society stigmatizes a person or group.",
              "Similarly, research demonstrating that higher levels of stigmatization are attributed towards individuals with more \u201csevere\u201d disorders (Angermeyer & Matschinger, 2005) also resembles these hierarchical categories and the disruptiveness and stability dimensions of stigma.",
              "Furthermore, Link and Phelan clearly illustrated the view of sociology towards stigma in their article titled Conceptualizing Stigma (2001).",
              "Link and Phelan (2001) argue that stigma is the co-occurrence of several components including labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination.",
              "First, labeling develops as a result of a social selection process to determine which differences matter in society.",
              "Differences such as race are easily identifiable and allow society to categorize people into groups.",

              "Society does not want to be associated with unattractive characteristics and thus hierarchical categories are created.",
              "Once these categories develop, the groups who have the most undesirable characteristics may become victims of status loss and discrimination.",
              "The entire process is accompanied by significant embarrassment by the individuals themselves and by those associated with them (Link & Phelan, 2001).",
              "While social psychology and sociology are the primary contributors to the stigma literature, other disciplines have provided insight as well.",
              "Communications, Anthropology, and Ethnography all favor theories that revolve around threat.",
              "In Communications literature, stigma is the result of an \u201cus versus them\u201d approach (Brashers, 2008).",
              "For example, the use of specific in-group language can reinforce in-group belongingness as well as promote out-group differentiation (Brashers, 2008).",
              "This is referenced in research on peer group relationships such that youth often rate interactions with their same-age peers more positively than with older adults (whether family members or not) (Giles, Noels, Williams, Ota, Lim, Ng, et.",

              ", 2003).",
              "This can also be applied to those with mental disorders in that individuals in the out-group (mental disorders) are perceived less favorably than the non-ill in-group.",

              "From this perspective, the focus is on the impact of stigma within the lived experience of each person.",
              "Stigma may impact persons with mental illnesses through their social network, including how it exists in the structures of lived experiences such as employment, relationships, and status.",
              "Further, the impact of stigma is a response to threat, which may be a natural or tactical self-preservation strategy.",
              "However, it only worsens the suffering of the stigmatized person (Yang, et al, 2007).",
              "It is important to note again that while many disciplines have been leaders in social stigma theory, social work-specific literature has been mostly void of discussion on this topic.",
              "This is particularly unusual, since stigma is an obvious factor that impacts the lives of social work clients on a daily basis.",
              "Crocker (1999) demonstrates that stigma is not only held among others in society but can also be internalized by the person with the condition.",
              "Thus, the continued impact of social/public stigma can influence an individual to feel guilty and inadequate about his or her condition (Corrigan, 2004).",
              "In addition, the collective representations of meaning in society \u2013 including shared values, beliefs, and ideologies \u2013 can act in place of direct public/social stigma in these situations (Crocker & Quinn, 2002).",
              "These collective representations include historical, political, and economic factors (Corrigan, Markowitz, and Watson, 2004).",
              "Thus, in self-stigma, the knowledge that stigma is present within society, can have an impact on an individual even if that person has not been directly stigmatized.",
              "This impact can have a deleterious effect on a person\u2019s self-esteem and self-efficacy, which may lead to altered behavioral presentation (Corrigan, 2007).",
              "Nonetheless, Crocker (1999) highlights that individuals are able to internalize stigma differently based on their given situations.",
              "This suggests that personal self-esteem may or may not be as affected by stigma depending on individual coping mechanisms (Crocker & Major, 1989).",
              "Similarly, other theories have provided insight into the idea of self-stigma.",
              "In modified labeling theory, the expectations of becoming stigmatized, in addition to actually being stigmatized, are factors that influence psychosocial well-being (Link, Cullen, Struening, Shrout, & Dohrenwend, 1989).",
              "In this context, it is primarily the fear of being labeled that causes the individual to feel stigmatized.",
              "Similarly, Weiner (1995) proposed that stigmatized beliefs provoke an emotional response.",

              "Pervasive in all aspects of psychiatric care, stigma leads to delayed treatment, increased morbidity, and diminished quality of life for those with poor mental health.",
              "Hence, better understanding the impact of stigma across different cultural contexts is critically essential, aiming to inform culturally nuanced strategies to minimize its consequences and contribute to a more equitable and effective psychiatric care system.",
              "The purpose of the present literature review is twofold (i) to examine the existing research on the stigma surrounding psychiatry across different cultural contexts and (ii) to identify the commonalities and differences in the nature, magnitude, and consequences of this stigma in different cultures in the psychiatry field.",
              "In addition, potential strategies for addressing stigma will be proposed.",
              "The review covers a range of countries and cultural settings, emphasizing the importance of understanding cultural nuances to combat stigma and promote mental health awareness globally.",
              "Stigma, characterized by societal prejudice and discrimination, profoundly influences psychiatric care, creating barriers to the timely recognition and treatment of mental health disorders [1].",
              "Deeply embedded in societal norms, stigma is a multifaceted issue permeating every level of psychiatric care, leading to delayed treatment, increased morbidity, and a diminished quality of life for patients.",
              "The importance of addressing stigma in psychiatry cannot be overstated as stigma impacts individuals seeking care, their families, healthcare professionals, and broader society.",
              "At the individual level, stigma can lead to fear and avoidance of mental health services, causing delays in seeking help even when a patient is in dire need.",
              "Delays in seeking care can exacerbate mental health conditions leading to worse outcomes and reduced quality of life [2].",
              "For families, the stigma can lead to shame and isolation, making seeking necessary support and resources more difficult.",
              "Interestingly, in healthcare professionals, stigma can lead to burnout and demoralization, reducing the quality and provision of care.",
              "Stigmatization can also create barriers between healthcare providers and patients, complicating matters to establishing trustful and therapeutic relationships, which are essential for effective care [1].",
              "For society at large, stigma can result in the misallocation of resources, with mental health services often being underfunded and overlooked [3].",
              "Hence stigma has profound effects at personal and societal levels, negatively impacting multiple levels of the psychotic care continuum.",
              "Addressing the stigma surrounding mental health can significantly enhance the effectiveness of psychiatric care.",
              "To this end, developing programs and strategies that foster a culture of understanding and acceptance may encourage more individuals to seek help when they need it, improving early detection and intervention, which are crucial for better health outcomes.",
              "Furthermore, challenging and changing stigmatizing attitudes can improve the therapeutic relationship between healthcare providers and patients, leading to more personalized and effective treatment strategies.",
              "Stigma, however, is not a monolithic entity but varies across cultures, influenced by distinct societal norms, values, and beliefs.",
              "Understanding these cultural variations is essential for developing effective, culturally sensitive interventions.",
              "Therefore, this literature review aims to examine the manifestation and impacts of stigma across different cultural contexts, laying the foundation for tailored strategies to combat this healthcare barrier.",
              "Stigma as a psychological construct In the literature, there have been several attempts at creating instruments to measure and understand stigma as a psychological construct in the context of mental health.",
              "In this vein, the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale and the Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination Scale, among others, seek to quantify stigma more objectively [4,5].",
              "The ISMI scale, as defined by Ritsher et al.",
              "(2003), measures the subjective experience of stigma, including the internalization of negative stereotypes and beliefs about mental illness [4].",
              "It includes five subscales: Alienation, Stereotype Endorsement, Discrimination Experience, Social Withdrawal, and Stigma Resistance.",
              "These subscales were further defined as follows: (i) Alienation: The feeling of being less than a full member of society due to one's mental illness, (ii) Stereotype Endorsement: The extent to which the individual agrees with common negative stereotypes about people with mental illness, (iii) Discrimination Experience: Personal experiences of rejection or exclusion due to mental illness, (iv) Social Withdrawal: The extent to which the individual avoids social situations for fear of being stigmatized, and (v) Stigma Resistance: The individual's ability to resist or counteract stigma.",
              "The Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination Scale, as described by Link (1987), measures the extent to which individuals believe that most people will devalue or discriminate against someone with a mental illness [5].",
              "It focuses on the individual's perceptions of societal attitudes, rather than their personal experiences with stigma.",
              "Overall, while the ISMI scale can give insights into the internalization and personal experience of stigma, the Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination Scale can provide a view of societal attitudes and perceived discrimination.",
              "The above are crucial to understanding the full landscape of stigma in psychiatry across different cultures by helping identify where interventions might be most needed and most effective, whether at the level of societal attitudes, personal beliefs, or both.",
              "The pervasive nature of stigma presents a daunting challenge to psychiatry, necessitating a rigorous and nuanced approach to its understanding and mitigation.",
              "However, despite recent awareness campaigns, the field still struggles with the barriers that stigma imposes on patient care, necessitating additional analysis of the effects.",
              "Individual and societal impact of stigma Stigmatization of mental illness across cultures is a significant barrier to psychiatric care.",
              "The stigma can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment-seeking behaviors, reduced quality of life, and an increased risk of social exclusion and discrimination [2].",
              "Furthermore, mental illness stigma often intersects with other forms of stigma, such as gender, race, and socio-economic status, leading to further marginalization of already vulnerable populations making it challenging to provide equitable, culturally sensitive, and effective psychiatric care to individuals with mental illness.",
              "Accumulating research suggests that stigma toward mental illness is common in various cultures, which can affect mental illness diagnosis, treatment, and management [6].",
              "Furthermore, some studies reveal that mental health stigma manifests differently across cultures and can be influenced by cultural beliefs, attitudes, and values [7].",
              "The stigma surrounding psychiatry and mental health disorders has numerous detrimental effects on individuals and communities, including: 1.",
              "Delayed Treatment-Seeking Behavior Stigma plays a significant role in delaying treatment-seeking behavior for individuals struggling with mental health issues.",
              "The fear of being labeled, ostracized, or misunderstood due to their condition often deters individuals from seeking help promptly.",
              "According to a study by Clement et al.",
              "(2015), stigma was associated with an increased likelihood of delaying or avoiding seeking help for mental health concerns [8].",
              "Consequently, symptoms may worsen over time, escalating the condition's severity and making treatment and prospective recovery more challenging.",
              "Healthcare delays can also lead to decreased self-esteem and increased depressive symptoms, creating a vicious cycle of self-blame, isolation, and hopelessness.",
              "Prolonged untreated mental health issues can further impair an individual's functionality in various life domains, including work, relationships, and self-care, thus reducing their overall quality of life [9].",
              "2.",
              "Social Isolation and Discrimination Stigma can lead to social isolation and discrimination for those affected by mental health issues.",
              "Brohan and Thornicroft (2010) found that individuals with mental health disorders often face discrimination in multiple life domains, including employment and interpersonal relationships [2].",
              "The negative stereotypes and misconceptions surrounding mental illness often result in a lack of understanding and empathy from others, leading to social exclusion [10].",
              "Individuals with mental health issues might face discrimination in various aspects of life, including the workplace, where they might encounter bias in hiring, job retention, and career advancement.",
              "Furthermore, to complicate matters, discrimination can further strain personal relationships, as friends and family may distance themselves due to discomfort, fear, or misunderstanding, exacerbating feelings of isolation and loneliness [9].",
              "3.",
              "Reduced Treatment Adherence Stigma can significantly impact adherence to mental health treatments.",
              "Sirey et al.",
              "(2001) found that perceived stigma predicted treatment discontinuation in older adults with depression [11].",
              "People living with mental health conditions may avoid or discontinue treatment due to fear of being identified as a mental health patient.",
              "This fear could stem from concerns about the stigma associated with visiting mental health facilities, taking psychiatric medications, or being seen engaging in therapeutic activities [12].",
              "Non-adherence to treatment regimens can lead to suboptimal treatment outcomes, hinder recovery, and increase the risk of relapse or worsening symptoms. Furthermore, stigma can diminish self-efficacy, making individuals less likely to actively engage in their treatment process, which is crucial for successful recovery.",
              "4.",
              "Perpetuation of Misconceptions Stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illness contribute to the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes and misinformation.",
              "AsCorrigan and Watson (2007) discussed, stereotypes such as appearing dangerous, unpredictable, or culpable for their illness can make people with mental illness perceived inaccurately as dangerous or to blame for their condition, both internally and externally [12].",
              "Stereotyping, deeply embedded in societal attitudes, can foster a culture of fear, rejection, and discrimination against individuals with mental health conditions.",
              "Misconceptions often result in people with mental health issues being perceived inaccurately as dangerous, unpredictable, or responsible for their condition.",
              "In addition, misinformation can hinder public understanding and acceptance of mental illness, exacerbating stigma while negatively influencing policy and legislation, leading to inadequate funding and support for mental health services.",
              "5.",
              "Influence of Gender on Stigma The impact of stigma on individuals with mental illness is known to vary across different social and demographic categories, including gender.",
              "Research evidence indicates that the experience of stigma related to mental illness can be significantly different for men and women, and these differences can be further influenced by cultural context.",
              "In some societies, women seem to face higher levels of stigma related to mental health issues compared with men.",
              "A study by Al Krenawi et al.",
              "(2006) conducted in the Bedouin-Arab community found that women experienced a significantly higher degree of stigma associated with mental illness than their male counterparts [13].",
              "This may be due to traditional gender roles and societal expectations, which often place women in a more subordinate position and associate mental illness with weakness or vulnerability.",
              "Women with mental illnesses may therefore face dual discrimination - first for their gender and then for their mental health condition.",
              "This can make women less likely to seek help for mental health issues, further exacerbating their condition and creating a vicious cycle of stigma and untreated mental illness.",
              "However, the influence of gender on stigma is not uniform across all cultures.",
              "Ayalon and Area\u0301n's (2004) study on older adults in an Arab cultural context found that men reported higher levels of perceived stigma related to mental illness than women [14].",
              "This discrepancy might be rooted in traditional masculine norms prevalent in many Arab societies, which value strength, stoicism, and emotional control.",
              "Mental illness, which is often erroneously perceived as a sign of emotional weakness or lack of control, can be particularly stigmatizing for men in these contexts.",
              "Furthermore, the expectation for men to be the primary earners and providers in the family can make the potential economic impacts of mental illness, such as unemployment or reduced productivity, particularly stigmatizing.",
              "These findings underscore the importance of considering gender and cultural context in understanding and addressing stigma related to mental illness.",
              "It is crucial to develop and implement culturally sensitive strategies that consider these differences in the experience of stigma.",
              "This might involve, for example, promoting mental health literacy, challenging harmful gender norms, and providing gender-specific mental health services.",
              "We can move toward a more equitable and effective mental health care system by acknowledging and addressing the unique stigma-related challenges different groups face.",
              "Ethnic and cultural variations in stigma The stigma surrounding psychiatry, as research suggests, manifests differently across cultures due to various factors [7].",
              "This stigma operates at various levels, including individuals, families, healthcare providers, and society, and cultural norms, religious beliefs, and social attitudes influence its manifestations and implications.",
              "At the individual level, mental health issues may be internalized differently depending on cultural background.",
              "For instance, some Asian cultures may view mental health issues as a sign of personal weakness or a failure of self-control [15].",
              "The internalization of stigma can significantly influence an individual's self-perception and willingness to seek help.",
              "In the family context, cultural beliefs also play a significant role in shaping attitudes toward mental health.",
              "A study by Yang and Kleinman (2008) found that in Chinese culture, mental illness is often attributed to social and interpersonal factors, such as family conflict [16].",
              "Such attributions can contribute to a sense of shame or blame within the family, exacerbating the stigma experienced by the individual with mental illness.",
              "Healthcare providers are not immune to these cultural beliefs and they can influence their practice.",
              "In some cultures, mental illnesses are viewed through a supernatural lens rather than a medical one.",
              "Girma et al.",
              "(2013) found that in Ethiopian culture, mental illness is commonly associated with supernatural causes, such as evil spirits or curses [17].",
              "This widely held belief can influence healthcare providers' approach and potentially limit the provision of evidence-based psychiatric care.",
              "Lastly, at the societal level, these cultural perceptions and beliefs can contribute to the broader social stigma surrounding mental health, leading to discrimination and social exclusion.",
              "Differences in societal perceptions across cultures can lead to distinct forms of discrimination, further compounding the challenges faced by individuals with mental health issues.",
              "Hence, understanding and addressing cultural stigma in psychiatry involves a multifaceted approach that considers individual, family, healthcare providers, and societal levels.",
              "Each level offers potential avenues for stigma reduction and improved mental health outcomes.",
              "Asian Cultures In many Asian societies, mental health issues are often perceived as a sign of personal weakness or a failure of self-control.",
              "The concept of 'face' is significantly influential, and the stigma associated with mental illness can be seen as bringing shame to the family [15].",
              "For instance, a strong cultural emphasis on academic and professional achievement in South Korea contributes to stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness, which may discourage individuals from seeking help [18].",
              "African Cultures Mental illnesses in some African cultures are often attributed to spiritual or supernatural causes such as curses or possession by evil spirits.",
              "This understanding can contribute to high levels of stigma and deter individuals from seeking psychiatric help [19].",
              "In Ethiopia, the belief in supernatural causes of mental illness has been reported, leading to the stigmatization of affected individuals [17].",
              "Arab Cultures Mental illness in Arab societies is frequently viewed as a form of divine punishment.",
              "Religious belief perpetuating mental health stigma can lead to delayed or avoided treatment as individuals may resort to religious or spiritual interventions [20].",
              "Latin American Cultures In some Latin American cultures, mental illness is often attributed to personal weakness or lack of willpower.",
              "This perspective could stigmatize individuals with mental health disorders and discourage them from seeking psychiatric care [21].",
              "Western Cultures In Western societies, stigma often stems from misconceptions about mental illness, including the belief that individuals with mental health disorders are dangerous or unpredictable.",
              "While mental illness is recognized more as a health issue, stigma still exists, often resulting in social exclusion and discrimination [12].",
              "Additionally, culture-bound syndromes, defined here as a combination of psychiatric and somatic symptoms that are considered to be a recognizable disease within specific cultures or societies, are a critical component of a discussion on cultural stigma in psychiatry.",
              "That is to say, culture-bound syndromes refer to unique mental health conditions closely tied to specific cultures or ethnic groups.",
              "For instance, among the Latino community, 'Ataque de Nervios,' characterized by uncontrollable shouting, crying, trembling, and sometimes aggressive behavior, is a recognized condition often associated with a stressful event such as a panic attack [21].",
              "Hence, a clinician's awareness and understanding of such culture-bound syndromes can enhance their diagnostic and therapeutic effectiveness.",
              "In fact, a study conducted by Hughes and Wintrob (1995) in New York discovered a significant improvement in therapeutic relationships when clinicians were knowledgeable about culture-bound syndromes prevalent in their patients' cultures, such as 'Qigong Psychotic Reaction' in Chinese immigrants, a condition associated with overdoing Qigong, a type of spiritual martial art [22].",
              "Furthermore, cultural competence, which includes knowledge about culture-bound syndromes, has a substantial impact on treatment outcomes.",
              "Culturally competent care, defined by an understanding and respect for cultural differences, can improve patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment.",
              "A systematic review by Truong et al.",
              "(2014) demonstrated the positive effect of cultural competence on healthcare outcomes, including in a Native American population suffering from 'Ghost Sickness,' a culture-bound syndrome characterized by feelings of terror, weakness, and a sense of impending doom, often linked to the perceived presence of the supernatural [23].",
              "Simultaneously, addressing culture-bound syndromes can influence and reduce mental health stigma across cultures.",
              "Misinterpretation of these syndromes can contribute to stigma, as individuals might be wrongly diagnosed or misunderstood.",
              "For instance, Kirmayer's (2012) study on cultural variations in depression and anxiety found that misunderstanding culture-bound syndromes, such as 'Taijin Kyofusho,' a Japanese syndrome characterized by an intense fear that one's body or bodily functions are displeasing to others, could lead to misdiagnosis and increase stigma [24].",
              "Practices that raise awareness of culture-bound syndromes offer a deeper, richer perspective on cultural influences on mental health.",
              "Awareness and understanding of these syndromes can enhance diagnostic and treatment approaches, optimize patient outcomes, and potentially contribute to reducing mental health stigma across various cultures.",
              "Taken together, these studies highlight the importance of understanding cultural contexts when addressing the stigma surrounding mental health disorders and psychiatric care.",
              "The cultural beliefs and attitudes towards mental health disorders, summarized below in Table \u200bTable1,1, influence how stigma is manifested and the approaches needed to reduce it effectively.",
              "By acknowledging cultural variations, more culturally appropriate and effective strategies can be developed to combat stigma and improve mental health care across different societies worldwide.",
              "Strategies for addressing mental health stigma Several strategies have been proposed in the literature to address the stigma surrounding psychiatry across cultures: 1.",
              "Public Awareness Campaigns Awareness campaigns can be instrumental in dismantling misconceptions and fostering understanding of mental health disorders.",
              "Public awareness campaigns can dispel myths, reduce stigma, and encourage empathy towards affected individuals by promoting accurate information about mental illnesses, their prevalence, and the possibilities for recovery.",
              "For instance, a study by Pinfold et al.",
              ", (2003) showed that public campaigns using direct social contact with people with mental illness could significantly improve public attitudes towards mental health [25].",
              "The study by Pinfold et al.",
              ", (2003) implemented educational interventions in UK secondary schools, consisting of video presentations and direct social contact with individuals who had personal experiences with mental illness [25].",
              "The UK campaign's goal was to challenge common myths about mental illness and replace them with accurate information.",
              "The results showed that students exposed to this intervention demonstrated less fear and avoidance of people with mental health problems and were more likely to see them as individuals rather than defining them by their illness.",
              "2.",
              "Cultural Competency Training for Healthcare Professionals Medical education can equip healthcare providers with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand and respect their patients' cultural backgrounds and experiences, which is critical for reducing stigma in healthcare settings.",

              "For instance, a study in Australia provided cultural competency training to healthcare providers and found that their understanding of Indigenous Australians' health needs significantly improved [24].",
              "They were able to better respect and incorporate Indigenous perspectives in treatment, which led to increased trust and better patient-provider relationships.",
