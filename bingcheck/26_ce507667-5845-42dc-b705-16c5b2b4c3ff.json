    "query": "What was the motivation behind Frida Kahlo's self-portraits, and how did her personal experiences influence her art?",
    "response": "Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter who is best known for her self-portraits that deal with themes such as identity, the human body, and death[^3^]. She painted about **seventy self-portraits**[^1^] [^4^] in her lifetime, which reflect her personal experiences and emotions. She once said: \\\"I paint self-portraits because I am the person I know best\\\"[^1^].\n\nSome of the factors that motivated her to paint self-portraits were:\n\n- Her physical and psychological suffering. Kahlo had a difficult life marked by a bus accident that left her with serious injuries, multiple surgeries, chronic pain, miscarriages, and infertility[^3^] [^4^]. She used painting as a way of coping with her pain and expressing her feelings[^4^] [^5^]. For example, in **The Broken Column** (1944), she depicted herself with a metal rod piercing her spine and nails piercing her skin, symbolizing her agony[^4^].\n- Her cultural identity. Kahlo was proud of her Mexican heritage and often wore traditional clothing and jewelry in her self-portraits[^2^] [^3^]. She also incorporated elements of Mexican folk art, such as retablos (devotional paintings on tin) and ex-votos (votive offerings) in her compositions[^2^]. She explored her mixed ancestry (European and indigenous) and how it shaped her sense of self[^3^]. For example, in **The Two Fridas** (1939), she portrayed herself as two different versions: one wearing a European-style dress and holding a locket with a portrait of her husband Diego Rivera, and the other wearing a Tehuana dress and holding a small anatomical heart connected to the other by a vein[^2^].\n- Her love and loss. Kahlo had a tumultuous relationship with muralist Diego Rivera, whom she married twice and divorced once. They both had affairs with other people, but they remained deeply connected through their artistic passion[^3^]. Kahlo expressed her love, jealousy, anger, and loneliness in her self-portraits[^4^]. For example, in **Self-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky** (1937), she commemorated her brief affair with the exiled Russian revolutionary leader by holding a bouquet of flowers and a letter to him[^2^]. In **Diego on My Mind** (1943), she painted herself wearing a Tehuana headdress with Rivera's face on her forehead, indicating his constant presence in her thoughts[^4^].",

              "She showed him some of her work, and he encouraged her to continue to paint.",

              "Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a nai\u0308ve folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society.",
              "[2] Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy.",
              "In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicayotl movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist.",
              "[3] She is also known for painting about her experience of chronic pain.",
              "[4] Born to a German father and a mestiza mother, Kahlo spent most of her childhood and adult life at La Casa Azul, her family home in Coyoaca\u0301n \u2013 now publicly accessible as the Frida Kahlo Museum.",
              "Although she was disabled by polio as a child, Kahlo had been a promising student headed for medical school until being injured in a bus accident at the age of 18, which caused her lifelong pain and medical problems. During her recovery, she returned to her childhood interest in art with the idea of becoming an artist.",
              "Kahlo's interests in politics and art led her to join the Mexican Communist Party in 1927,[1] through which she met fellow Mexican artist Diego Rivera.",
              "The couple married in 1929[1][5] and spent the late 1920s and early 1930s travelling in Mexico and the United States together.",
              "During this time, she developed her artistic style, drawing her main inspiration from Mexican folk culture, and painted mostly small self-portraits that mixed elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic beliefs.",
              "Her paintings raised the interest of surrealist artist Andre\u0301 Breton, who arranged for Kahlo's first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938;",

              "Kahlo's work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican national and indigenous traditions and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form.",

              "[8] In 1925, she began to work outside of school to help her family.",

              "[8] A severe bus accident at the age of 18 left Kahlo in lifelong pain.",
              "Confined to bed for three months following the accident, Kahlo began to paint.",
              "[12] She started to consider a career as a medical illustrator, as well, which would combine her interests in science and art.",
              "Her mother provided her with a specially-made easel, which enabled her to paint in bed, and her father lent her some of his oil paints.",
              "She had a mirror placed above the easel, so that she could see herself.",
              "[13][12] Painting became a way for Kahlo to explore questions of identity and existence.",
              "[14] She explained, \"I paint myself because I am often alone and I am the subject I know best.\"",
              "[12] She later stated that the accident and the isolating recovery period made her desire \"to begin again, painting things just as [she] saw them with [her] own eyes and nothing more.\"",
              "[15] Most of the paintings Kahlo made during this time were portraits of herself, her sisters, and her schoolfriends.",
              "[16] Her early paintings and correspondence show that she drew inspiration especially from European artists, in particular Renaissance masters such as Sandro Botticelli and Bronzino[17] and from avant-garde movements such as Neue Sachlichkeit and Cubism.",
              "[18] On moving to Morelos in 1929 with her husband Rivera, Kahlo was inspired by the city of Cuernavaca where they lived.",
              "[19] She changed her artistic style and increasingly drew inspiration from Mexican folk art.",
              "[20] Art historian Andrea Kettenmann states that she may have been influenced by Adolfo Best Maugard's treatise on the subject, for she incorporated many of the characteristics that he outlined \u2013 for example, the lack of perspective and the combining of elements from pre-Columbian and colonial periods of Mexican art.",
              "[21] Her identification with La Raza, the people of Mexico, and her profound interest in its culture remained important facets of her art throughout the rest of her life.",
              "[22] When Kahlo and Rivera moved to San Francisco in 1930, Kahlo was introduced to American artists such as Edward Weston, Ralph Stackpole, Timothy L.",
              "Pflueger, and Nickolas Muray.",
              "[23] The six months spent in San Francisco were a productive period for Kahlo,[24] who further developed the folk art style she had adopted in Cuernavaca.",
              "[25] In addition to painting portraits of several new acquaintances,[26] she made Frieda and Diego Rivera (1931), a double portrait based on their wedding photograph,[27] and The Portrait of Luther Burbank (1931), which depicted the eponymous horticulturist as a hybrid between a human and a plant.",
              "[28] Although she still publicly presented herself as simply Rivera's spouse rather than as an artist,[29] she participated for the first time in an exhibition, when Frieda and Diego Rivera was included in the Sixth Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists in the Palace of the Legion of Honor.",
              "[30][31] On moving to Detroit with Rivera, Kahlo experienced numerous health problems related to a failed pregnancy.",
              "[32] Despite these health problems, as well as her dislike for the capitalist culture of the United States,[33] Kahlo's time in the city was beneficial for her artistic expression.",
              "She experimented with different techniques, such as etching and frescos,[34] and her paintings began to show a stronger narrative style.",
              "[35] She also began placing emphasis on the themes of \"terror, suffering, wounds, and pain\".",
              "[34] Despite the popularity of the mural in Mexican art at the time, she adopted a diametrically opposed medium, votive images or retablos, religious paintings made on small metal sheets by amateur artists to thank saints for their blessings during a calamity.",
              "[36] Amongst the works she made in the retablo manner in Detroit are Henry Ford Hospital (1932), My Birth (1932), and Self-Portrait on the Border of Mexico and the United States (1932).",
              "[34] While none of Kahlo's works were featured in exhibitions in Detroit, she gave an interview to the Detroit News on her art;",
              "the article was condescendingly titled \"Wife of the Master Mural Painter Gleefully Dabbles in Works of Art\".",
              "[37] Upon returning to Mexico City in 1934 Kahlo made no new paintings, and only two in the following year, due to health complications.",
              "[38] In 1937 and 1938, however, Kahlo's artistic career was extremely productive, following her divorce and then reconciliation with Rivera.",
              "She painted more \"than she had done in all her eight previous years of marriage\", creating such works as My Nurse and I (1937), Memory, the Heart (1937), Four Inhabitants of Mexico (1938), and What the Water Gave Me (1938).",
              "[39] Although she was still unsure about her work, the National Autonomous University of Mexico exhibited some of her paintings in early 1938.",
              "[40] She made her first significant sale in the summer of 1938 when film star and art collector Edward G.",
              "Robinson purchased four paintings at $200 each.",
              "[40] Even greater recognition followed when French Surrealist Andre\u0301 Breton visited Rivera in April 1938.",
              "He was impressed by Kahlo, immediately claiming her as a surrealist and describing her work as \"a ribbon around a bomb\".",
              "[41] He not only promised to arrange for her paintings to be exhibited in Paris but also wrote to his friend and art dealer, Julien Levy, who invited her to hold her first solo exhibition at his gallery on the East 57th Street in Manhattan.",
              "[42] In October, Kahlo traveled alone to New York, where her colorful Mexican dress \"caused a sensation\" and made her seen as \"the height of exotica\".",
              "[41] The exhibition opening in November was attended by famous figures such as Georgia O'Keeffe and Clare Boothe Luce and received much positive attention in the press, although many critics adopted a condescending tone in their reviews.",
              "[43] For example, Time wrote that \"Little Frida's pictures .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "had the daintiness of miniatures, the vivid reds, and yellows of Mexican tradition and the playfully bloody fancy of an unsentimental child\".",
              "[44] Despite the Great Depression, Kahlo sold half of the 25 paintings presented in the exhibition.",
              "[45] She also received commissions from A.",
              "Conger Goodyear, then the president of the MoMA, and Clare Boothe Luce, for whom she painted a portrait of Luce's friend, socialite Dorothy Hale, who had committed suicide by jumping from her apartment building.",
              "[46] During the three months she spent in New York, Kahlo painted very little, instead focusing on enjoying the city to the extent that her fragile health allowed.",
              "[47] She also had several affairs, continuing the one with Nickolas Muray and engaging in ones with Levy and Edgar Kaufmann, Jr.",
              "[48] In January 1939, Kahlo sailed to Paris to follow up on Andre\u0301 Breton's invitation to stage an exhibition of her work.",
              "[49] When she arrived, she found that he had not cleared her paintings from the customs and no longer even owned a gallery.",
              "[50] With the aid of Marcel Duchamp, she was able to arrange for an exhibition at the Renou et Colle Gallery.",
              "[50] Further problems arose when the gallery refused to show all but two of Kahlo's paintings, considering them too shocking for audiences,[51] and Breton insisted that they be shown alongside photographs by Manuel Alvarez Bravo, pre-Columbian sculptures, 18th- and 19th-century Mexican portraits, and what she considered \"junk\": sugar skulls, toys, and other items he had bought from Mexican markets.",
              "[52] The exhibition opened in March, but received much less attention than she had received in the United States, partly due to the looming Second World War, and made a loss financially, which led Kahlo to cancel a planned exhibition in London.",
              "[53] Regardless, the Louvre purchased The Frame, making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection.",
              "[54] She was also warmly received by other Parisian artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro\u0301,[52] as well as the fashion world, with designer Elsa Schiaparelli designing a dress inspired by her and Vogue Paris featuring her on its pages.",
              "[53] However, her overall opinion of Paris and the Surrealists remained negative;",
              "in a letter to Muray, she called them \"this bunch of coocoo lunatics and very stupid surrealists\"[52] who \"are so crazy 'intellectual' and rotten that I can't even stand them anymore\".",
              "[55] In the United States, Kahlo's paintings continued to raise interest.",
              "In 1941, her works were featured at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, and, in the following year, she participated in two high-profile exhibitions in New York, the Twentieth-Century Portraits exhibition at the MoMA and the Surrealists' First Papers of Surrealism exhibition.",
              "[56] In 1943, she was included in the Mexican Art Today exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Women Artists at Peggy Guggenheim's The Art of This Century gallery in New York.",
              "[57] Kahlo gained more appreciation for her art in Mexico as well.",
              "She became a founding member of the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana, a group of twenty-five artists commissioned by the Ministry of Public Education in 1942 to spread public knowledge of Mexican culture.",
              "[58] As a member, she took part in planning exhibitions and attended a conference on art.",
              "[59] In Mexico City, her paintings were featured in two exhibitions on Mexican art that were staged at the English-language Benjamin Franklin Library in 1943 and 1944.",
              "She was invited to participate in \"Salon de la Flor\", an exhibition presented at the annual flower exposition.",
              "[60] An article by Rivera on Kahlo's art was also published in the journal published by the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana.",
              "[61] In 1943, Kahlo accepted a teaching position at the recently reformed, nationalistic Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \"La Esmeralda\".",
              "[62] She encouraged her students to treat her in an informal and non-hierarchical way and taught them to appreciate Mexican popular culture and folk art and to derive their subjects from the street.",
              "[63] When her health problems made it difficult for her to commute to the school in Mexico City, she began to hold her lessons at La Casa Azul.",
              "[64] Four of her students \u2013 Fanny Rabel, Arturo Garci\u0301a Bustos, Guillermo Monroy, and Arturo Estrada \u2013 became devotees, and were referred to as \"Los Fridos\" for their enthusiasm.",
              "[65] Kahlo secured three mural commissions for herself and her students.",
              "[66] In 1944, they painted La Rosita, a pulqueria in Coyoaca\u0301n.",
              "In 1945, the government commissioned them to paint murals for a Coyoaca\u0301n launderette as part of a national scheme to help poor women who made their living as laundresses.",
              "The same year, the group created murals for Posada del Sol, a hotel in Mexico City.",
              "However, it was destroyed soon after completion as the hotel's owner did not like it.",
              "[citation needed] Kahlo struggled to make a living from her art until the mid to late 1940s, as she refused to adapt her style to suit her clients' wishes.",
              "[67] She received two commissions from the Mexican government in the early 1940s.",
              "She did not complete the first one, possibly due to her dislike of the subject, and the second commission was rejected by the commissioning body.",
              "[67] Nevertheless, she had regular private clients, such as engineer Eduardo Morillo Safa, who ordered more than thirty portraits of family members over the decade.",
              "[67] Her financial situation improved when she received a 5000-peso national prize for her painting Moses (1945) in 1946 and when The Two Fridas was purchased by the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1947.",
              "[68] According to art historian Andrea Kettenmann, by the mid-1940s, her paintings were \"featured in the majority of group exhibitions in Mexico\".",
              "Further, Martha Zamora wrote that she could \"sell whatever she was currently painting;",
              "sometimes incomplete pictures were purchased right off the easel\".",
              "[69] Even as Kahlo was gaining recognition in Mexico, her health was declining rapidly, and an attempted surgery to support her spine failed.",
              "[70] Her paintings from this period include Broken Column (1944), Without Hope (1945), Tree of Hope, Stand Fast (1946), and The Wounded Deer (1946), reflecting her poor physical state.",
              "[70] During her last years, Kahlo was mostly confined to the Casa Azul.",
              "[71] She painted mostly still lifes, portraying fruit and flowers with political symbols such as flags or doves.",
              "[72] She was concerned about being able to portray her political convictions, stating that \"I have a great restlessness about my paintings.",
              "Mainly because I want to make it useful to the revolutionary communist movement.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "until now I have managed simply an honest expression of my own self .",

              ".",
              "I must struggle with all my strength to ensure that the little positive my health allows me to do also benefits the Revolution, the only real reason to live.\"",
              "[73][74] She also altered her painting style: her brushstrokes, previously delicate and careful, were now hastier, her use of color more brash, and the overall style more intense and feverish.",
              "[75] Photographer Lola Alvarez Bravo understood that Kahlo did not have much longer to live, and thus staged her first solo exhibition in Mexico at the Galeri\u0301a Arte Contemporaneo in April 1953.",
              "[76] Though Kahlo was initially not due to attend the opening, as her doctors had prescribed bed rest for her, she ordered her four-poster bed to be moved from her home to the gallery.",
              "To the surprise of the guests, she arrived in an ambulance and was carried on a stretcher to the bed, where she stayed for the duration of the party.",
              "[76] The exhibition was a notable cultural event in Mexico and also received attention in mainstream press around the world.",
              "[77] The same year, the Tate Gallery's exhibition on Mexican art in London featured five of her paintings.",
              "[78] In 1954, Kahlo was again hospitalized in April and May.",
              "[79] That spring, she resumed painting after a one-year interval.",
              "[80] Her last paintings include the political Marxism Will Give Health to the Sick (c.",
              "1954) and Frida and Stalin (c.",
              "1954) and the still-life Viva La Vida (1954).",
              "[81] Estimates vary on how many paintings Kahlo made during her life, with figures ranging from fewer than 150[82] to around 200.",
              "[83][84] Her earliest paintings, which she made in the mid-1920s, show influence from Renaissance masters and European avant-garde artists such as Amedeo Modigliani.",
              "[85] Towards the end of the decade, Kahlo derived more inspiration from Mexican folk art,[86] drawn to its elements of \"fantasy, naivety, and fascination with violence and death\".",
              "[84] The style she developed mixed reality with surrealistic elements and often depicted pain and death.",
              "[87] One of Kahlo's earliest champions was Surrealist artist Andre\u0301 Breton, who claimed her as part of the movement as an artist who had supposedly developed her style \"in total ignorance of the ideas that motivated the activities of my friends and myself\".",
              "[88] This was echoed by Bertram D.",
              "Wolfe, who wrote that Kahlo's was a \"sort of 'nai\u0308ve' Surrealism, which she invented for herself\".",
              "[89] Although Breton regarded her as mostly a feminine force within the Surrealist movement, Kahlo brought postcolonial questions and themes to the forefront of her brand of Surrealism.",
              "[90] Breton also described Kahlo's work as \"wonderfully situated at the point of intersection between the political (philosophical) line and the artistic line\".",
              "[91] While she subsequently participated in Surrealist exhibitions, she stated that she \"detest[ed] Surrealism\", which to her was \"bourgeois art\" and not \"true art that the people hope from the artist\".",
              "[92] Some art historians have disagreed whether her work should be classified as belonging to the movement at all.",
              "According to Andrea Kettenmann, Kahlo was a symbolist concerned more in portraying her inner experiences.",
              "[93] Emma Dexter has argued that, as Kahlo derived her mix of fantasy and reality mainly from Aztec mythology and Mexican culture instead of Surrealism, it is more appropriate to consider her paintings as having more in common with magical realism, also known as New Objectivity.",
              "It combined reality and fantasy and employed similar style to Kahlo's, such as flattened perspective, clearly outlined characters and bright colours.",
              "[94] Similarly to many other contemporary Mexican artists, Kahlo was heavily influenced by Mexicanidad, a romantic nationalism that had developed in the aftermath of the revolution.",
              "[95][84] The Mexicanidad movement claimed to resist the \"mindset of cultural inferiority\" created by colonialism, and placed special importance on indigenous cultures.",
              "[96] Before the revolution, Mexican folk culture \u2013 a mixture of indigenous and European elements \u2013 was disparaged by the elite, who claimed to have purely European ancestry and regarded Europe as the definition of civilization which Mexico should imitate.",
              "[97] Kahlo's artistic ambition was to paint for the Mexican people, and she stated that she wished \"to be worthy, with my paintings, of the people to whom I belong and to the ideas which strengthen me\".",
              "[92] To enforce this image, she preferred to conceal the education she had received in art from her father and Ferdinand Fernandez and at the preparatory school.",
              "Instead, she cultivated an image of herself as a \"self-taught and naive artist\".",
              "[98] When Kahlo began her career as an artist in the 1920s, muralists dominated the Mexican art scene.",
              "They created large public pieces in the vein of Renaissance masters and Russian socialist realists: they usually depicted masses of people, and their political messages were easy to decipher.",
              "[99] Although she was close to muralists such as Rivera, Jose\u0301 Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siquieros and shared their commitment to socialism and Mexican nationalism, the majority of Kahlo's paintings were self-portraits of relatively small size.",
              "[100][84] Particularly in the 1930s, her style was especially indebted to votive paintings or retablos, which were postcard-sized religious images made by amateur artists.",
              "[101] Their purpose was to thank saints for their protection during a calamity, and they normally depicted an event, such as an illness or an accident, from which its commissioner had been saved.",
              "[102] The focus was on the figures depicted, and they seldom featured a realistic perspective or detailed background, thus distilling the event to its essentials.",
              "[103] Kahlo had an extensive collection of approximately 2,000 retablos, which she displayed on the walls of La Casa Azul.",
              "[104] According to Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen, the retablo format enabled Kahlo to \"develop the limits of the purely iconic and allowed her to use narrative and allegory\".",
              "[105] Many of Kahlo's self-portraits mimic the classic bust-length portraits that were fashionable during the colonial era, but they subverted the format by depicting their subject as less attractive than in reality.",
              "[106] She concentrated more frequently on this format towards the end of the 1930s, thus reflecting changes in Mexican society.",
              "Increasingly disillusioned by the legacy of the revolution and struggling to cope with the effects of the Great Depression, Mexicans were abandoning the ethos of socialism for individualism.",
              "[107] This was reflected by the \"personality cults\", which developed around Mexican film stars such as Dolores del Ri\u0301o.",
              "[107] According to Schaefer, Kahlo's \"mask-like self-portraits echo the contemporaneous fascination with the cinematic close-up of feminine beauty, as well as the mystique of female otherness expressed in film noir.\"",
              "[107] By always repeating the same facial features, Kahlo drew from the depiction of goddesses and saints in indigenous and Catholic cultures.",
              "[108] Out of specific Mexican folk artists, Kahlo was especially influenced by Hermenegildo Bustos, whose works portrayed Mexican culture and peasant life, and Jose\u0301 Guadalupe Posada, who depicted accidents and crime in satiric manner.",
              "[109] She also derived inspiration from the works of Hieronymus Bosch, whom she called a \"man of genius\", and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, whose focus on peasant life was similar to her own interest in the Mexican people.",
              "[110] Another influence was the poet Rosario Castellanos, whose poems often chronicle a woman's lot in the patriarchal Mexican society, a concern with the female body, and tell stories of immense physical and emotional pain.",
              "[86] Kahlo's paintings often feature root imagery, with roots growing out of her body to tie her to the ground.",
              "This reflects in a positive sense the theme of personal growth;",
              "in a negative sense of being trapped in a particular place, time and situation;",
              "and in an ambiguous sense of how memories of the past influence the present for good and/or ill.",
              "[111] In My Grandparents and I, Kahlo painted herself as a ten-year old, holding a ribbon that grows from an ancient tree that bears the portraits of her grandparents and other ancestors while her left foot is a tree trunk growing out of the ground, reflecting Kahlo's view of humanity's unity with the earth and her own sense of unity with Mexico.",
              "[112] In Kahlo's paintings, trees serve as symbols of hope, of strength and of a continuity that transcends generations.",
              "[113] Additionally, hair features as a symbol of growth and of the feminine in Kahlo's paintings and in Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair, Kahlo painted herself wearing a man's suit and shorn of her long hair, which she had just cut off.",
              "[114] Kahlo holds the scissors with one hand menacingly close to her genitals, which can be interpreted as a threat to Rivera \u2013 whose frequent unfaithfulness infuriated her \u2013 and/or a threat to harm her own body like she has attacked her own hair, a sign of the way that women often project their fury against others onto themselves.",
              "[115] Moreover, the picture reflects Kahlo's frustration not only with Rivera, but also her unease with the patriarchal values of Mexico as the scissors symbolize a malevolent sense of masculinity that threatens to \"cut up\" women, both metaphorically and literally.",
              "[115] In Mexico, the traditional Spanish values of machismo were widely embraced, but Kahlo was always uncomfortable with machismo.",
              "[115] As she suffered for the rest of her life from the bus accident in her youth, Kahlo spent much of her life in hospitals and undergoing surgery, much of it performed by quacks who Kahlo believed could restore her back to where she had been before the accident.",
              "[112] Many of Kahlo's paintings are concerned with medical imagery, which is presented in terms of pain and hurt, featuring Kahlo bleeding and displaying her open wounds.",
              "[112] Many of Kahlo's medical paintings, especially dealing with childbirth and miscarriage, have a strong sense of guilt, of a sense of living one's life at the expense of another who has died so one might live.",
              "[113] Although Kahlo featured herself and events from her life in her paintings, they were often ambiguous in meaning.",
              "[116] She did not use them only to show her subjective experience but to raise questions about Mexican society and the construction of identity within it, particularly gender, race, and social class.",
              "[117] Historian Liza Bakewell has stated that Kahlo \"recognized the conflicts brought on by revolutionary ideology\": What was it to be a Mexican?",
              "\u2013 modern, yet pre-Columbian;",
              "young, yet old;",
              "anti-Catholic yet Catholic;",
              "Western, yet New World;",
              "developing, yet underdeveloped;",
              "independent, yet colonized;",
              "mestizo, yet not Spanish nor Indian.",
              "[118] To explore these questions through her art, Kahlo developed a complex iconography, extensively employing pre-Columbian and Christian symbols and mythology in her paintings.",
              "[119] In most of her self-portraits, she depicts her face as mask-like, but surrounded by visual cues which allow the viewer to decipher deeper meanings for it.",
              "Aztec mythology features heavily in Kahlo's paintings in symbols including monkeys, skeletons, skulls, blood, and hearts;",
              "often, these symbols referred to the myths of Coatlicue, Quetzalcoatl, and Xolotl.",
              "[120] Other central elements that Kahlo derived from Aztec mythology were hybridity and dualism.",
              "[121] Many of her paintings depict opposites: life and death, pre-modernity and modernity, Mexican and European, male and female.",
              "[119] In addition to Aztec legends, Kahlo frequently depicted two central female figures from Mexican folklore in her paintings: La Llorona and La Malinche[122] as interlinked to the hard situations, the suffering, misfortune or judgement, as being calamitous, wretched or being \"de la chingada\".",
              "[123] For example, when she painted herself following her miscarriage in Detroit in Henry Ford Hospital (1932), she shows herself as weeping, with dishevelled hair and an exposed heart, which are all considered part of the appearance of La Llorona, a woman who murdered her children.",
              "[124] The painting was traditionally interpreted as simply a depiction of Kahlo's grief and pain over her failed pregnancies.",
              "But with the interpretation of the symbols in the painting and the information of Kahlo's actual views towards motherhood from her correspondence, the painting has been seen as depicting the unconventional and taboo choice of a woman remaining childless in Mexican society.",
              "[125] Kahlo often featured her own body in her paintings, presenting it in varying states and disguises: as wounded, broken, as a child, or clothed in different outfits, such as the Tehuana costume, a man's suit, or a European dress.",
              "[126] She used her body as a metaphor to explore questions on societal roles.",
              "[127] Her paintings often depicted the female body in an unconventional manner, such as during miscarriages, and childbirth or cross-dressing.",
              "[128] In depicting the female body in graphic manner, Kahlo positioned the viewer in the role of the voyeur, \"making it virtually impossible for a viewer not to assume a consciously held position in response\".",
              "[129] According to Nancy Cooey, Kahlo made herself through her paintings into \"the main character of her own mythology, as a woman, as a Mexican, and as a suffering person .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "She knew how to convert each into a symbol or sign capable of expressing the enormous spiritual resistance of humanity and its splendid sexuality\".",
              "[130] Similarly, Nancy Deffebach has stated that Kahlo \"created herself as a subject who was female, Mexican, modern, and powerful\", and who diverged from the usual dichotomy of roles of mother/whore allowed to women in Mexican society.",
              "[131] Due to her gender and divergence from the muralist tradition, Kahlo's paintings were treated as less political and more nai\u0308ve and subjective than those of her male counterparts up until the late 1980s.",
              "[132] According to art historian Joan Borsa, the critical reception of her exploration of subjectivity and personal history has all too frequently denied or de-emphasized the politics involved in examining one's own location, inheritances and social conditions .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "Critical responses continue to gloss over Kahlo's reworking of the personal, ignoring or minimizing her interrogation of sexuality, sexual difference, marginality, cultural identity, female subjectivity, politics and power.",
              "[82] Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Caldero\u0301n[a] was born on 6 July 1907 in Coyoaca\u0301n, a village on the outskirts of Mexico City.",
              "[134][135] Kahlo stated that she was born at the family home, La Casa Azul (The Blue House), but according to the official birth registry, the birth took place at the nearby home of her maternal grandmother.",
              "[136] Kahlo's parents were photographer Guillermo Kahlo (1871\u20131941) and Matilde Caldero\u0301n y Gonza\u0301lez (1876\u20131932), and they were thirty-six and thirty, respectively, when they had her.",
              "[137] Originally from Germany, Guillermo had immigrated to Mexico in 1891, after epilepsy caused by an accident ended his university studies.",
              "[138] Although Kahlo said her father was Jewish and her paternal grandparents were Jews from the city of Arad,[139] this claim was challenged in 2006 by a pair of German genealogists who found he was instead a Lutheran.",
              "[140][141] Matilde was born in Oaxaca to an Indigenous father and a mother of Spanish descent.",
              "[142] In addition to Kahlo, the marriage produced daughters Matilde (c.",

              "[145] Both parents were often sick,[146] and their marriage was devoid of love.",
              "[147] Her relationship with her mother, Matilde, was extremely tense.",
              "[148] Kahlo described her mother as \"kind, active and intelligent, but also calculating, cruel and fanatically religious\".",
              "[148] Her father Guillermo's photography business suffered greatly during the Mexican Revolution, as the overthrown government had commissioned works from him, and the long civil war limited the number of private clients.",
              "[146] When Kahlo was six years old, she contracted polio, which eventually made her right leg grow shorter and thinner than the left.",
              "[149][b] The illness forced her to be isolated from her peers for months, and she was bullied.",
              "[152] While the experience made her reclusive,[145] it made her Guillermo's favorite due to their shared experience of living with disability.",

              "[154] He also taught her photography, and she began to help him retouch, develop, and color photographs.",
              "[155] Due to polio, Kahlo began school later than her peers.",
              "[156] Along with her younger sister Cristina, she attended the local kindergarten and primary school in Coyoaca\u0301n and was homeschooled for the fifth and sixth grades.",
              "[157] While Cristina followed their sisters into a convent school, Kahlo was enrolled in a German school due to their father's wishes.",
              "[158] She was soon expelled for disobedience and was sent to a vocational teachers school.",
              "[157] Her stay at the school was brief, as she was sexually abused by a female teacher.",
              "[157] In 1922, Kahlo was accepted to the elite National Preparatory School, where she focused on natural sciences with the aim of becoming a physician.",

              "[160] She performed well academically,[10] was a voracious reader, and became \"deeply immersed and seriously committed to Mexican culture, political activism and issues of social justice\".",
              "[161] The school promoted indigenismo, a new sense of Mexican identity that took pride in the country's indigenous heritage and sought to rid itself of the colonial mindset of Europe as superior to Mexico.",
              "[162] Particularly influential to Kahlo at this time were nine of her schoolmates, with whom she formed an informal group called the \"Cachuchas\" \u2013 many of them would become leading figures of the Mexican intellectual elite.",

              "[163] To mask the fact that she was older and to declare herself a \"daughter of the revolution\", she began saying that she had been born on 7 July 1910, the year the Mexican Revolution began, which she continued throughout her life.",
              "[164] She fell in love with Alejandro Gomez Arias, the leader of the group and her first love.",
              "Her parents did not approve of the relationship.",

              "[165][166][167] Kahlo suffered many injuries: her pelvic bone had been fractured, her abdomen and uterus had been punctured by the rail, her spine was broken in three places, her right leg was broken in eleven places, her right foot was crushed and dislocated, her collarbone was broken, and her shoulder was dislocated.",
              "[165][168] She spent a month in hospital and two months recovering at home before being able to return to work.",
              "[166][167][169] As she continued to experience fatigue and back pain, her doctors ordered X-rays, which revealed that the accident had also displaced three vertebrae.",

              "[174] Shortly after their introduction in 1928, Kahlo asked him to judge whether her paintings showed enough talent for her to pursue a career as an artist.",

              "[184] During the civil war Morelos had seen some of the heaviest fighting, and life in the Spanish-style city of Cuernavaca sharpened Kahlo's sense of a Mexican identity and history.",
              "[19] Similar to many other Mexican women artists and intellectuals at the time,[185] Kahlo began wearing traditional indigenous Mexican peasant clothing to emphasize her mestiza ancestry: long and colorful skirts, huipils and rebozos, elaborate headdresses and masses of jewelry.",

              "[274] According to John Berger, Kahlo's popularity is partly due to the fact that \"the sharing of pain is one of the essential preconditions for a refinding of dignity and hope\" in twenty-first century society.",
              "[275] Kirk Varnedoe, the former chief curator of MoMA, has stated that Kahlo's posthumous success is linked to the way in which \"she clicks with today's sensibilities \u2013 her psycho-obsessive concern with herself, her creation of a personal alternative world carries a voltage.",
              "Her constant remaking of her identity, her construction of a theater of the self are exactly what preoccupy such contemporary artists as Cindy Sherman or Kiki Smith and, on a more popular level, Madonna.",

              "She fits well with the odd, androgynous hormonal chemistry of our particular epoch.\"",
              "[151] Kahlo's posthumous popularity and the commercialization of her image have drawn criticism from many scholars and cultural commenters, who think that, not only have many facets of her life been mythologized, but the dramatic aspects of her biography have also overshadowed her art, producing a simplistic reading of her works in which they are reduced to literal descriptions of events in her life.",
              "[276] According to journalist Stephanie Mencimer, Kahlo \"has been embraced as a poster child for every possible politically correct cause\" and like a game of telephone, the more Kahlo's story has been told, the more it has been distorted, omitting uncomfortable details that show her to be a far more complex and flawed figure than the movies and cookbooks suggest.",
              "This elevation of the artist over the art diminishes the public understanding of Kahlo's place in history and overshadows the deeper and more disturbing truths in her work.",
              "Even more troubling, though, is that by airbrushing her biography, Kahlo's promoters have set her up for the inevitable fall so typical of women artists, that time when the contrarians will band together and take sport in shooting down her inflated image, and with it, her art.\"",
              "[269] Baddeley has compared the interest in Kahlo's life to the interest in the troubled life of Vincent van Gogh but has also stated that a crucial difference between the two is that most people associate Van Gogh with his paintings, whereas Kahlo is usually signified by an image of herself \u2013 an intriguing commentary on the way male and female artists are regarded.",
              "[277] Similarly, Peter Wollen has compared Kahlo's cult-like following to that of Sylvia Plath, whose \"unusually complex and contradictory art\" has been overshadowed by simplified focus on her life.",

              "Out of love for her husband Diego Rivera, Kahlo tried repeatedly to conceive a male child.",
              "Unfortunately, the streetcar accident had rendered her body unable to support a pregnancy.",
              "Unable to carry a child to term, Kahlo created works exploring themes of infertility in a manner that shocked many of her contemporaries.",
              "In the painting Henry Ford Hospital (1932), for example, Kahlo shows her body lying on a hospital bed\u2014naked and hemorrhaging after a miscarriage and tethered to a stillborn fetus and objects symbolizing the anatomic structures of reproduction.",
              "Her emotional pain is evident from the tear falling down her face and the amount of blood.",
              "Her isolation is conveyed by the barren landscape surrounding her hospital bed.",
              "Though numerous industrial buildings are observed in the distant landscape, Kahlo utilizes their remoteness to represent the literal and figurative distance between Rivera and herself\u2014he was working on a mural in Detroit while she suffered the miscarriage alone at the hospital.",
              "Another evocative painting is My Birth (1932), which draws on painful memories of a miscarriage and the death of her mother.",
              "Kahlo structures the painting with elements from the ex voto tradition, in which a near-tragedy event is illustrated along with the religious figure intervening protectively.",
              "In this painting, however, Kahlo recounts her birth not as near-tragic event but simply as a tragic event.",
              "No family members or friends are present to support her mother, suggesting her birth is unwelcome.",
              "She paints herself emerging from her mother\u2019s body as a stillborn child, suggesting to the observer that her failing health began on the day she was born.",
              "Having lived a life of pain and disillusionment in health and marriage, Kahlo may have retrospectively deemed her entire life as worthless.",
              "Kahlo perceived her infertility as a failure in her role as a woman and a wife in Mexican society.",
              "Unfortunately, her marriage suffered for reasons beyond her infertility.",
              "Kahlo experienced severe mental anguish during her marriage due to Rivera\u2019s numerous extramarital affairs with artists, models, actresses, and photographers.",
              "Early in her marriage, Kahlo tried to ignore the affairs;",
              "she believed Rivera would only seek short-lived, casual liaisons.",
              "But Rivera\u2019s paramours would include Kahlo\u2019s own sister Cristina.",
              "The discovery of Rivera\u2019s and Cristina\u2019s betrayal devastated Kahlo and she ceased to paint for several months.",
              "When she did begin to paint again, her anguish is clearly evident.",
              "In the painting Memory (1937), Kahlo communicates emotional pain by portraying her body with a gaping wound in the chest and her eviscerated heart lying on the ground, hemorrhaging blood.",
              "As Kahlo biographer Hayden Herrera notes, \u201cthe greater the pain she wished to convey\u2014especially pain caused by rejection from Diego\u2014the bloodier Frida\u2019s self-portraits became\u201d [7].",
              "In the painting Self-portrait with Cropped Hair (1940), Kahlo reflects on her marriage and divorce from Rivera and the emotions fueling her pain: desolation, devastation, and defeat.",
              "Unlike previous works in which Kahlo adorns herself with colorful clothing and beautiful jewelry, she now wears an ill-fitting dark suit, implying a renunciation of femininity.",
              "With a pair of scissors in her right hand, Kahlo completes the transformation by cutting off her beautiful long black hair.",
              "In Kahlo\u2019s works, we observe the dehumanizing effects of her physical and emotional pain.",
              "She exposes her physical injuries and emotional suffering so that we may understand her life and challenges.",
              "Yet, among the many dozens of paintings in her body of artwork, Kahlo never painted the streetcar accident that wounded her teenage body.",
              "According to Herrera, \u201c[t]he accident was too \u2018complicated\u2019 and \u2018important\u2019 to reduce to a simple comprehensible image\u201d [3].",
              "While memories of the accident were too traumatizing for Kahlo to revisit, she found strength and catharsis in painting the other painful memories of her life.",
              "The depiction of physical and emotional pain in the artworks by Kahlo has not gone unnoticed in the health care community.",
              "For example, a New York psychologist uses Kahlo\u2019s artwork in therapy sessions to help women talk about their experiences of emotional and physical trauma such as infidelity, violence, and infertility [12].",
              "The experience of pain and the damage done by it can be palpable in Kahlo\u2019s work.",
              "The hope of the author is that Kahlo\u2019s work will empower more patients to talk about their own pain.",
              "Frida Kahlo\u2019s life and artwork can serve as a resource for physicians who want to better comprehend the experience and dehumanizing consequences of pain.",
              "Her paintings are a medium to visualize pain and the effect of pain on the human condition.",
              "We witness the suffering, grief, and doubt in Kahlo\u2019s paintings;",

              "Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderon was a famous Mexican painter born in Mexico City in 1907.",
              "She began painting in the mid-1920s and continued to do so throughout the rest of her life.",
              "Kahlo was known mostly for her Surrealist self-portraits, but unknown to many was her lifelong struggle with chronic illness and the origin of the pain in the art that she created.",
              "Frida Kahlo grew up in Coyoaca\u0301n, a southern neighborhood in central Mexico City.",
              "She was born to a German immigrant father, Wilhelm, and a Spanish and Native American mother, Matilde.",
              "At just six years of age, Frida contracted polio and was unable to leave her bed for nine months.",
              "At the time, there were no effective treatments for polio and it wouldn\u2019t be until decades later that the first successful polio vaccines were invented.",
              "Due to the disease, Frida\u2019s right leg and foot were significantly thinner than her left ones.",
              "Nevertheless, as Frida grew healthier she played soccer, swam regularly, and even participated in wrestling\u2013 breaking many gender norms of the time.",
              "At age fifteen, Frida Kahlo began attending the National Preparatory School in Mexico City, a prestigious and renowned school.",
              "She was one of only thirty-five girls selected to attend.",
              "At the school, she met Mexican muralist Diego Rivera and often watched him work.",
              "While attending school, Frida became involved with a group of students with similar, more progressive political ideas.",
              "The students named themselves the Cachuchas, after a nickname for a cap worn by members of the group.",
              "One member of the group, Alejandro Gomez Arias, began a romantic relationship with Frida, even exchanging love letters with her.",
              "While Kahlo and Arias were traveling home from school one afternoon, the driver of the bus they were on attempted to cross in front of an electric streetcar which ended up with the two vehicles colliding and the bus being dragged for several feet.",
              "Nearly everyone on the bus ended up passing away, either instantly because of the impact or later due to their injuries.",

              "Though the Muralists, in particular Los Tres Grandes (Diego Rivera, Jose\u0301 Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros), have been largely accredited as the visual architects of twentieth-century Mexican national identity, response to the question of mexicanidad was varied.",
              "Frida Kahlo\u2019s body of work proffered a compelling alternative to the government-endorsed Muralist movement, championing the intimacies of individual experience as opposed to the centralised nationalist rhetoric which reigned prevalent amongst her contemporaries.",
              "As a means of supplementing this approach, her paintings borrow purposefully from the popular imagery of the Mexican folk retablo genre.",
              "Traditional systems of iconography designed to elicit or document divine encounter are effectively co-opted and reimagined throughout her visual world to create sites of personal encounter, which explore understandings of faith, suffering and identity on both private and collective levels.",
              "The resulting images emphasize the ways in which Kahlo's relationship to herself, tradition and the nation are inextricably linked.",
              "The creation and distribution of devotional images used for home-altars was a thriving folk art tradition in Mexico throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.",
              "Painted in oil on sheets of tin by self-taught retablero artists, these retablo images would typically depict holy personages (retablo Santos, de Guadalupe or serve as thanksgiving for a particular event or miracle (retablo ex-voto, El Sen\u0303or de la Misericordia (1954)).",
              "The works themselves are characterised by a vibrant approach to colour and ornamentation.",
              "Due to the artists\u2019 lack of formal training, retablo works often have a skewed perspective and inexact depiction of anatomical elements.",
              "Brought to the Americas as a strategy for Catholic conversion during the Spanish conquest, retablo art took on a life of its own when it merged with pre-existing indigenous pagan belief systems and practices in Mexico.",
              "The resulting genre serves as a unique expression of syncretic Mexican popular identity, as it transcended the boundaries of officially sanctioned Catholic religion.",
              "Essentially, retablo art emerged as a means to depict authentic accounts of the events, hopes and struggles of local Mexican communities.",
              "de Guadalupe, oil on tin, 25cm x 36cm from Mexican Folk Retablos by Gloria Kay Giffords El Sen\u0303or de la Misericordia (1954) oil on tin, 15cm x 23cm, from Mexican Folk Retablos by Gloria Kay Giffords Relevant both to the private nature of devotional practice in Mexico and communal identity, the retablo form was already widely familiar to the Mexican consciousness by the start of the twentieth century.",
              "This familiarity in turn presented opportunity for innovation- the genre could be harnessed poetically as a bridge between individual and collective experiences, as seen in the works of Kahlo.",
              "Kahlo\u2019s love for Mexican folk art was a vital source of inspiration for her own work.",
              "Along with her husband, Diego Rivera, she was known to have kept a collection of around two thousand retablo images displayed around her residence, The Blue House, in Coyoaca\u0301n.",
              "Kahlo\u2019s mother, Matilda Calderon, was a devout Catholic and had her daughters educated in religious schools.",
              "While Kahlo herself was a pronounced atheist, she continued to make use of Catholic imagery and iconographic language in her artwork.",
              "Many of her paintings directly adopt the format of the ex-voto, mimicking the genre\u2019s approach to narrative and medium, as well as its stylised treatment of colour and form.",
              "Her actual subject matter is then frequently utilised to a subversive end;",
              "the viewer is often made uncomfortably aware of the absence of miracle usually commemorated in ex-voto art.",
              "Kahlo\u2019s faith in her own self clearly supersedes her faith in divine intervention, as suggested in Mi Nacimiento (1932).",
              "Painted in the traditional ex-voto manner of oil on metal in small dimensions, the scene depicts the aftermath of a traumatic birth.",
              "Life and death, personified through the newly born baby and the deceased mother respectively, are presented in chilling concurrence;",
              "a violent juxtaposition echoed by the brutal contrast of blood against white bed sheets.",
              "Below the bed stretches a horizontal scroll, which is importantly left blank- there has been no miracle for which to give thanks.",
              "A framed retablo of the Mater Dolorosa (Virgin of Sorrows) on the wall looks out over the scene, symbolising the suffering experienced by the subjects and alluding to Kahlo\u2019s own linkage with the Dolorosa.",
              "Frida Kahlo, Mi nacimiento (1932), https://historia-arte.",
              "com/obras/mi-nacimiento.",
              "Imagery of the Mater Dolorosa in Kahlo\u2019s art lends itself to allegorical interpretation within a postcolonial context.",
              "Oriana Baddeley has outlined the connection between Mexico\u2019s colonised past and La Llorona, \u2018the weeping woman\u2019 of popular myth as well as La Chingada, the so-called mother of mestizo culture and female embodiment of post-conquest Mexico, a chain of symbolism which can be further extended to the Virgin of Sorrows.",
              "A personification of Mary\u2019s deep grief at the suffering and crucifixion of Christ, the Mater Dolorosa can be interpreted as yet another archetypal embodiment of the agony accompanying mother-loss, and subsequently as a visual counterpart of the injured, defiled manifestation of Mexico\u2019s colonised past.",
              "Kahlo\u2019s self-identification with the figure of the Virgin of Sorrows can be sensed throughout much of her self-imagery, as well as in her personal writing- one letter to Alejandro Gomez Arias written in 1926 is even signed as \u2018Virgen Lacrimorum\u2019, or Virgin of the Tears.",
              "This relation to Mary\u2019s suffering is used as a means of examining the pain which would follow Kahlo throughout her own life, as seen in Henry Ford Hospital (1932).",
              "Here, Kahlo\u2019s use of symbolic objects is found to mirror the iconography of the retablo santo tradition, specifically that commonly used to symbolise the seven sorrows of the Virgin.",
              "One such retablo (seen below Mater Dolorosa) illustrates the efficacy of this vocabulary: the figure of the Virgin in her distinguishing red and blue gownery is surrounded by symbols of Christ\u2019s Passion, including the reed with which he was beaten (reinterpreted as a corn-stalk), a crown of thorns, three nails used for his crucifixion, and the Sacred Heart.",
              "Frida Kahlo, Henry Ford Hospital Room (1932), https://artsandculture.",
              "google.",
              "com/asset/henry-ford-hospital/kgHTa-02kVhHJA?",
              "hl=en-GB&avm=2.",
              "Mater Dolorosa, oil on tin, 12cm x 17cm Clear parallels can be drawn between the iconographic language found in retablo paintings and the symbolism Kahlo uses in Henry Ford Hospital to explain her own mother-loss tragedy: the misscarriage she suffered in Detroit that same year.",
              "Naked in a hospital bed, Kahlo is shown connected through vein-like red ribbons to various emblematic objects: the fetus of her unborn son;",
              "a snail and an orchid, both symbols of fertility;",
              "a skeletal pelvis and a machine used to make casts, in reference to the ongoing medical problems stemming from her accident in 1925;",
              "and what appears to be an anatomical figure of the female reproductive system.",
              "Beyond these iconographic similarities, there is a significant likeness between the facial expression of Kahlo\u2019s self-portrait, shown as visibly weeping, and the image of the Dolorosa.",
              "Similarities of their suffering are continuously accentuated to communicate an implicit hopefulness;",
              "as the Virgin of Sorrows was evoked at the loss of a child, Kahlo\u2019s self-identification with her image following her own miscarriage implies her position as self-declared hero within her own tragic narrative.",
              "This sentiment in turn resonates with the wider national struggle felt across Mexico throughout the twentieth century: as a continuation of the archetypal image of mother-loss, Kahlo\u2019s status as hero within her own story sets an example for the overcoming of shared national traumas, including colonialism and war.",
              "Thus, while the immediate subject matter of Henry Ford Hospital is Kahlo\u2019s miscarriage and personal suffering, the nature of retablo and ex-voto traditions is such that the personal and the collective are profoundly entwined.",
              "Kahlo\u2019s tortured self, acting as the subject of most of her work, not only parallels the imagery and suffering of the Virgin but also acts as a visual counterpart to the injury and suffering inflicted by Mexico\u2019s colonised past.",
              "She is simultaneously La Llorona of popular myth and the Catholic Virgin of Sorrows, but above all she is Frida;",
              "her struggle is at once indicative of the collective suffering harboured in Mexico's cultural memory and entirely her own.",
              "The retablo provided an ideal model for the expression of cultural distinction and self-determination amongst Mexican artists of the post-revolutionary period.",
              "References to the genre throughout the works of Frida Kahlo, demonstrate how she connected to her own heritage whilst recycling the retablo\u2019s known iconographic language of suffering to a subversive end.",
              "In opposition to traditional feminizations of colonial trauma, the images of female suffering presented in her paintings are strong, enduring images which assert the potential for dignified cultural resistance.",
              "Imbued with an essential sense of mexicanidad which transcends time and political circumstance, her works parting message is one which resonated powerfully throughout post-revolutionary Mexico: just as perseverance in the face of suffering and against odds would come to define Kahlo\u2019s own career and personal life, so too should it define the spirit of Mexican identity, if it was to prevail.",

              "it is a key to the inner recesses of Kahlo\u2019s heart and heritage.",
              "Whether or not the artist intentionally left it open to interpretation for us, the viewers, or simply just painted what she felt due to her heartbreak and pain, nonetheless, it holds many meanings, and maybe Kahlo painted it with many meanings in mind.",
              "\u201cThe Two Fridas\u201d meaning could possibly be allocated to four different explanations that the artist incorporated in her painting, namely and most importantly, the hurt and sadness from her divorce from Diego Rivera.",
              "The other three meanings could be around the chronic pain she always experienced due to the near-fatal accident when she was younger, her indigenous Mexican and European heritage, and the schism this may have formed within her identity as a woman, and lastly, some sources state that Kahlo referred to her imaginary friend when she was growing up, which the artist could be alluding to in her painting here.",
              "It is interesting to note that some sources also refer to Kahlo\u2019s earlier oil painting Frieda and Diego Rivera (1931), which depicts the couple standing together holding each other\u2019s hands.",
              "This has been a part of the question as to why Frida Kahlo painted her own double self-portrait, and part of uncovering its meaning, some relate to her significant relationship with Rivera.",
              "The painting, Frieda and Diego Rivera, was produced as a portrait of the couple indicating their wedding and married life.",
              "In this painting we notice how their hands barely touch, Frida\u2019s right hand, our left, is just clasping Diego\u2019s left hand, our right, which is underneath.",
              "Similarly, there are numerous meanings in this painting, and Kahlo undoubtedly hinted at what was beyond just a \u201chappy marriage\u201d, subtly pointing to her husband\u2019s affairs, questioning the stability of their marriage.",
              "We see this similar hand-holding in Frida\u2019s \u201cLas Dos\u201d painting.",
              "However, here, Frida is holding her own hand, which could possibly indicate a new type of marriage she underwent with herself, deepening her relationship with herself.",
              "This ultimately gives her masterwork painting a deeper meaning altogether, showing us how she held her own hand through her heartbreak and pain, holding her own hand as she walked across the bridge that gapped her role as a woman in a European world and a woman in a Mexican world.",
              "It has become her emblem of courage and bravery in a world that seemed wholly dualistic.",

              "Beyond the above, Kahlo has been honored in many pop-cultural references, including film, music like the song Frida Kahlo\u2019s Visit to the Taybridge Bar by Michael Marra, books like the children\u2019s publication Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos (2017), and various authors like Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s novel The Lacuna (2009), as well as various other plays.",
              "In The Two Fridas Kahlo depicts two sides of herself that are wholly different;",
              "the one side that is seemingly broken and in pain, bleeding out so to say, and the other side that is seemingly strong and whole, rooted in her heritage and love with Rivera.",
              "She ultimately shows us two sides of the same coin: while she has two sides, she is still one person, multifaceted and simultaneously experiencing various emotions.",
              "Frida Kahlo used herself as the model and recipient of deeper meanings pictured through her paintings.",
              "Some sources describe her as using her body as the \u201cmetaphor\u201d in addressing these various issues.",
              "She showed us many facets of herself and in almost all her paintings she wore her heart wide open for the world to see.",

              "Take a look at our The Two Fridas webstory here!",
              "The Two Fridas (1939) painting has different meanings, but it was painted when Kahlo was going through a divorce with her husband Diego Rivera, depicting her heartbreak and sadness.",
              "It also symbolizes Kahlo\u2019s different identities, namely her European and Mexican identities, evident in the dresses she wears.",

              "The Two Fridas (1939) by Frida Kahlo was exhibited in 1940 at the International Surrealist Exhibition, which was held in Mexico.",
              "Kahlo met the Surrealist pioneer, Andre\u0301 Breton in 1938.",
              "Through him, she exhibited in Paris and New York City, however, she never considered herself a Surrealist painter.",
              "Her style was more like Magical Realism, which was a combination of reality and fantasy.",

              "It was first bought by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, which was during 1947, and before then it was still held by Frida Kahlo.",
              "The Two Fridas (1939) depicts Frida Kahlo in two different dresses, one dress is a classic Victorian wedding dress, which covers her entire body and gives the idea of conservatism and rigidness, while the other dress is from the Tehuana culture, which is more colorful and appears freer and less restricted.",
              "It also reveals more of Kahlo\u2019s skin where the white dress covers most of her body.",

              "The first noticeable indicator is that while Diego looks modern in his suit, Frida looks traditional in her attire.",
              "The painting also privileges Diego over Frida in terms of accomplishment.",
              "While Diego appeared modern and successful standing close to the foreground of the painting, Frieda would have disappeared into the background but for the red scarf around her shoulder.",
              "The painting seems to suggest that Frida assumed the role of the traditional Mexican wife soon after getting married, an idea she abhorred.",

              "Frida explained in her journal that the painting depicts a rebirth of herself.",
              "However, there are references in the frightening large painting that points to Frida\u2019s struggle with having children.",
              "While the sheet covering the woman\u2019s face references the death of Frida\u2019s mother, the woman giving birth points to Frida\u2019s recent miscarriage and abortion.",
