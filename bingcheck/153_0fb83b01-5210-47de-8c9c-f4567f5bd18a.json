    "response": "Epigenetics is the study of how your behaviors and environment can cause changes that affect the way your genes work. Unlike genetic changes, epigenetic changes are reversible and do not change your DNA sequence, but they can change how your body reads a DNA sequence[^1^] [^2^]. Epigenetic changes can affect gene expression, which refers to how often or when proteins are created from the instructions within your genes[^1^]. Epigenetic changes can occur as part of normal development and aging, or in response to external factors such as diet, stress, toxins, or infections[^1^] [^2^].\n\nEpigenetic changes can impact the expression of genes and the development of certain traits and diseases in individuals and across generations by turning genes \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d[^1^] [^2^]. For example, epigenetics can determine which function a cell will have, such as a heart cell, nerve cell, or skin cell[^1^]. Epigenetics can also influence the risk of developing diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, or mental disorders by altering the activity of genes involved in these processes[^2^] [^3^]. Epigenetic changes can be inherited from parents to offspring through the sperm or egg cells, or they can be acquired during one's lifetime[^2^] [^3^]. Some epigenetic changes may be beneficial, while others may be harmful depending on the context and environment[^2^] [^3^].\n\nI hope this helps you understand the concept of epigenetics better. \ud83d\ude0a",

              "Briefly, negatively charged DNA is packaged around a positively charged histone protein octamer, which contains 2 copies of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.",

              "The chromatin of a chromosome exists as either loose, transcriptionally active euchromatin or dense, transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.",
              "[4] Chemical alterations to histone proteins can induce the formation of either the open euchromatin state, which facilitates gene expression by allowing transcription factors and enzymes to interact with the DNA, or the closed heterochromatin state, which suppresses gene expression by preventing initiation of transcription.",
              "In addition to histone changes, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism associated with gene silencing when the methylation occurs in CpG islands of promoter sequences.",
              "[5] Further, non-coding RNA sequences have shown to play a key role in the regulation of gene expression.",
              "[6] These epigenetic modifications can be induced by several factors including age, diet, smoking, stress, and disease state.",
              "[7][8] Epigenetic modifications are reversible, but they rarely remain through generations in humans despite persisting through multiple cycles of cell replication.",
              "[9] Epigenetic mechanisms form a layer of control within a cell that regulates gene expression and silencing.",
              "This control varies between tissues and plays an important role in cell differentiation.",
              "[10] Additionally, differences in gene expression between cells, which are driven by epigenetic modifications, result in the unique function of specific cell types.",

              "In cancer, the normal epigenetic patterns are disrupted resulting in the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes like CDKN2A.",
              "[12] Three different epigenetic mechanisms have been identified: DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing.",
              "Catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes, DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group directly to a cytosine nucleotide within a cytosine-guanine sequence (CpG), which are often surrounded by other CpG\u2019s forming a CpG island.",
              "CpG islands are common targets for epigenetic DNA methylation, notably the CpG islands within promoter regions.",

              "[13] Methylated cytosines within a promoter region recruit gene suppressor proteins and reduce interaction between the DNA and transcription factors.",
              "[14] Cytosine methylation also drives the formation of heterochromatin, so the nucleosome tightening prevents transcriptional machinery from interacting with the DNA.",
              "[15] As such, DNA methylation within promoter regions results in gene silencing.",
              "Cancers often show marked hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of proto-oncogenes, both of which contribute to tumor carcinogenesis.",
              "[15] This epigenetic mechanism also plays an important role in tissue-specific gene regulation, genomic imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation.",
              "[14] The second epigenetic mechanism is post-translational modifications to histone proteins.",
              "These modifications include enzyme-catalyzed acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, each of which alters the DNA-histone interactions in nucleosomes.",
              "[16] Histone acetylation often occurs at positively charged lysine residues which weakens the DNA-histone interactions, thus opening the chromatin and facilitating transcription.",
              "[17] For example, acetylation of lysine 9 and lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac, respectively) correlates with transcription activation.",
              "Histone methylation is more complex as it does not change the histone protein charge and can include the addition of 1-3 methyl groups to lysine and 1-2 methyl groups to arginine.",
              "[17] For example, methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me) is associated with transcription activation while trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) correlates with transcription repression.",
              "[18] Histone phosphorylation involves the addition of a negative phosphate group to the histone tail, but less is known of its function aside from phosphorylation of H2A(X) playing a role in the response to DNA damage and its subsequent repair.",
              "[19] Histone ubiquitylation involves the addition of a large ubiquitin molecule to lysine residues.",
              "Examples of histone ubiquitylation include H2AK119ub, which is associated with gene silencing, and H2BK123ub, which is involved in transcription.",
              "[17] Aside from the relatively straightforward effect of histone acetylation on gene expression, the effects of other histone modifications are complex and greatly influenced by the state of nearby DNA molecules.",
              "The most recently elucidated epigenetic mechanism is non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing.",
              "A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is transcribed but not translated into proteins.",
              "Once regarded as waste of the genome, recent insight suggests the ncRNA molecules harbor a crucial role in epigenetic gene expression and likely account for the great difference in phenotype between species and within human populations despite such similarity in encoded proteins.",
              "[6][18] Notable ncRNA molecules include microRNAs (miRNA) and short interfering RNAs (siRNA), which include less than 30 nucleotides, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which are 200 nucleotides or longer.",
              "Though the full extent of their role in epigenetics is still being determined, there is evidence suggesting that ncRNAs participate in DNA methylation and histone modifications in addition to gene silencing.",
              "[20] siRNAs and lncRNAs both have been shown to regulate gene expression by the formation of heterochromatin.",
              "[6][21] As people age, the largest influence on the epigenome is the environment.",
              "Direct influencers such as diet can affect one's epigenome, as determined by the Dutch famine studies.",
              "[22][23] Other environmental stressors include smoking and psychological stress.",
              "Epigenetic changes in utero are particularly sensitive as the epigenetic profile of the fetus is forming and developing rapidly during this time.",
              "[24] Indeed, teratogens like cigarette smoke, alcohol, and specific minerals have shown to induce in utero epigenetic changes.",
              "[24][25] Perhaps the most studied clinical application of epigenetic mechanisms is cancer.",
              "One of the first reports of epigenetics involved in cancer reported hypomethylation of DNA in cancer cell genomes, which caused overexpression of genes within that cell.",
              "[26] Since this report, great strides have been made toward understanding the role of epigenetics in carcinogenesis.",
              "For example, the degree of DNA methylation continues to decrease as a benign tumor cell progresses to invasive cancer.",
              "[27] Other studies have shown hypomethylation of pro-proliferative genes like BAX2 that are suppressed in normal cells.",
              "[28] Other reports show hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, like Rb, BCRA1, and CDKN2A, in cancer cells.",
              "[29][30][31] Despite the wealth of knowledge present on the relationship between epigenetics and carcinogenesis, treatment development is still very much in the preliminary phase for most cancers.",
              "Epigenetics is a promising field of research because of the potential to regulate gene expression without changing the DNA sequence, which may likely cause safety and ethical concerns if performed in humans.",
              "The most promising way to treat diseases through epigenetic regulation has been through pharmacology.",
              "Previous clinical trials for drugs formulated to block epigenetic modifications associated with cancers have proved successful.",
              "The FDA has approved a number of these drugs which target epigenetic regulators to treat various cancers including azacytidine and decitabine for myelodysplastic syndrome, panobinostat for multiple myeloma, and romidepsin for cutaneous T cell lymphoma.",
              "[32] More drugs are likely to be approved in the coming years as a number of clinical trials for DNA methylation inhibitors and histone modification inhibitors are underway.",
              "In addition to cancers, many conditions associated with genomic imprinting are the result of malfunctioning epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms can induce disease, but they are also necessary for normal cell function, specifically in imprinted genes where only one parental chromosome is expressed.",
              "For genomic imprinting to successfully occur, the other parental chromosome must be silenced, which occurs through DNA methylation.",
              "Noteworthy conditions associated with abnormalities in gene imprinting include Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, and Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome.",
              "[33][34] Recent studies have shown positive results for epigenetic-based therapies for imprinting disorders, which may be a field of increased focus in the coming years in search of better treatments.",

              "You have full access to this article via your institution.",
              "Biologists have long sought to understand how a fertilized egg can form an organism composed of hundreds of specialized cell types, each expressing a defined set of genes.",
              "Cellular identity is now accepted to be the result of the expression of specific combinations of genes (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "This expression pattern must be established and maintained\u2014two distinct, but connected, processes.",
              "The pluripotency of the initial cell and the establishment of cell types depend to a large extent on the coordinated deployment of hundreds of transcription factors that bind to specific DNA sequences to activate or repress the transcription of cell lineage genes1.",
              "This establishment phase corresponds most closely to what is generally cited as the first definition of epigenetics by Conrad Waddington, namely the study of the mechanisms by which the genotype produces the phenotype in the context of development2.",
              "The maintenance phase often involves a plethora of non-DNA sequence specific chromatin cofactors that set up and maintain chromatin states through cell division and for extended periods of time\u2014sometimes in the absence of the initial transcription factors3.",
              "This phase is more akin to a definition of epigenetics put forward by Nanney4, then elaborated on by Riggs and Holliday5,6,7 and further modified by Bird8 and others9 to mean the inheritance of alternative chromatin states in the absence of changes in the DNA sequence.",
              "DNA methylation was proposed early on as a carrier of epigenetic information with subsequent work revealing that chromatin proteins and noncoding RNAs are also important for this process10,11,12,13,14.",
              "For example, histone variants and histone modifications can influence local chromatin structure, either directly or indirectly.",
              "Such modifications can be heritable but reversible and are governed by a series of writers (that deposit them), readers (to interpret them) and erasers (to remove them).",
              "Finally, higher-order 3D chromosome folding is also thought to modulate gene expression and might contribute to inheritance15.",
              "Starting from the zygotic genome, stage- and cell-type-specific transcription factors initiate regulatory cascades that induce cell differentiation.",
              "Epigenetic components (for example, Polycomb PRC1/2 and Trithorax group proteins) maintain the \u2018off\u2019 states of certain genes and the \u2018on\u2019 states of others, in a cell-type- and time-specific manner (the bottom panels show three genes, depicted schematically as chromatinized templates, in which transcription is triggered by specific transcription factors and silent or active states are maintained by PRC1/2 or Trithorax proteins, respectively).",
              "In doing so, they constitute barriers against accidental reprogramming that maintain developmental and physiological homeostasis.",
              "Altered epigenomes can lead to changes in programmed cell differentiation or, when accidental, to disease (bottom right).",
              "Germline reprogramming resets the majority (but not all) of the epigenome to achieve reproduction (top right).",
              "Since 1942, when the word was first coined, epigenetics has been redefined multiple times16 (Table 1).",
              "In this Review, we use epigenetics to mean \u201cthe study of molecules and mechanisms that can perpetuate alternative gene activity states in the context of the same DNA sequence\u201d.",
              "This operational definition has several implications.",
              "First, it encompasses transgenerational inheritance as well as mitotic inheritance and the persistence of gene activity or chromatin states through extended periods of time, even without cell division\u2014for instance, in long-lived post-mitotic cells such as adult neurons.",
              "Second, the DNA sequence to be considered depends on the biological system.",
              "In mitotic inheritance, one should consider the genomic sequence of individual cells, whereas in transgenerational inheritance one should consider the DNA of the whole organism (including its microbiota, if this can contribute to inheritance).",
              "Finally, this definition explicitly extends the usage of \u2018epigenetic\u2019 to regulatory processes that involve molecules known to participate in epigenetic inheritance, even when not addressing the epigenetic memory function per se.",
              "We argue that this common practice should be accepted, as it conveys to non-specialists the broader field of epigenetic research.",
              "We also note that cases of inheritance that do not involve chromosomal components have been documented14,17,18 and it will be important to study how widespread they are and whether similar phenomena occur in humans.",
              "Here, we review the interplay between regulatory plasticity and stable epigenetic heritability, including cell fate and reprogramming events that occur during development, in response to physiological stimuli, and in disease.",
              "We discuss how noncoding RNAs, DNA methylation, heterochromatin, Polycomb and Trithorax proteins and 3D genome architecture (Box 1) can regulate both inheritance and gene expression plasticity, and how new technologies allow these phenomena to be analysed in a spatiotemporal fashion, in small numbers of cells or even single cells, and at multiple scales from the nucleotide to the chromosome (Box 2).",
              "We discuss evidence for a hotly debated topic\u2014epigenetic inheritance across generations\u2014particularly focusing on mammalian examples because of the potential biomedical implications.",
              "We also consider two other important new research areas: the potential influence of the environment and the effects of epigenetic changes on genome integrity.",
              "In closing, we highlight how epigenetic research may benefit human health.",
              "Heterochromatin components Pericentric heterochromatin contains a large number of proteins, but its most distinctive feature is the presence of megabase-sized repetitive DNA domains coated in a specific histone H3K9 trimethylation mark, which is deposited by the enzymes SUV39 and SETDB1.",
              "This mark is bound by the chromo domain of SUV39H1, which stimulates catalytic activity of the enzyme152.",
              "Furthermore, the same mark is bound by the HP1 protein, which can bridge adjacent nucleosomes153.",
              "Therefore, heterochromatin components can both write and read the H3K9me3 mark and compact their target chromatin.",
              "Heterochromatin factors also collaborate with RNAi in plants, yeast and some animals to convey epigenetic inheritance.",
              "Polycomb proteins Early genetic studies classified Polycomb (PcG) and Trithorax into two antagonistic groups that maintain the memory of spatial patterns of expression of homeotic genes throughout development.",
              "These complexes also have key roles in the maintenance of developmentally or environmentally programmed expression states, such as X-chromosome inactivation or cold-induced vernalization in plants3.",
              "PcG proteins are found in two main classes of complex\u2014PRC2 and PRC1\u2014that are responsible for deposition of the H3K27me3 and H2AK119Ub marks via EZH2 and RING1A/1B, respectively3.",
              "PcG proteins can be recruited to specific regions of the genome by DNA-binding proteins or noncoding RNAs3.",
              "PRC2 complexes contain a writer, the histone methyltransferase enzyme EZH2 (or its less efficient paralogue EZH1), and a reader, the EED subunit.",
              "Similar to HP1, CBX subunits of PRC1 complexes contain a chromodomain that specifically recognizes H3K27me3.",
              "Finally, another PRC1 subunit, PHC1-3, can oligomerize and induce 3D clustering in nuclear foci in vivo3.",
              "Noncoding RNAs Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) belong to several classes, and neither their production nor their functions can be generalized.",
              "Many ncRNAs, such as microRNAs, regulate post-transcriptional processes, whereas others are involved in transcriptional regulation.",
              "Short noncoding RNAs, such as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), are shorter than 30 nucleotides, whereas long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) vary in size (up to more than 100 kilobases).",
              "The best characterized of these is probably the X-inactive specific transcript (Xist)154.",
              "Many short ncRNAs act within or outside chromatin, and some, for example siRNAs and tRNA fragments, can diffuse extracellularly14, whereas many nuclear lncRNAs are chromatin-associated.",
              "Enhancer RNAs can activate genes155, but most short and long ncRNAs are repressive, act via chromatin (H3K9me3, Polycomb) or DNA methylation154,156, and can induce epigenetic memory by building self-enforcing loops with heterochromatin or the RNAi machinery.",
              "They are also involved in the regulation of higher-order chromatin architecture.",
              "DNA methylation The mechanisms that allow DNA methylation to be copied during DNA replication represent one of the best-understood epigenetic systems, and involve specific proteins that recognize CpG hemi-methylated DNA and thereby redeposit DNA methylation on newly replicated DNA.",
              "DNA methylation is maintained by the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 and its partner UHRF1 (also known as NP95), which specifically binds hemimethylated DNA and stimulates DNMT1 via its ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig.",
              "2).",
              "Therefore, as recently reviewed in detail157, a single complex contains both the \u2018writer\u2019 and the \u2018reader\u2019 of the epigenetic methyl CpG mark, and both moieties are essential for the maintenance of DNA methylation.",
              "The understanding of epigenetic inheritance requires the ability to tell whether progenies retain parental phenotypes.",
              "Early studies on mitotic inheritance were severely hampered by limitations in describing the molecular states of individual cells.",
              "However, modern low-cell and single-cell technologies are allowing high-throughput quantitative measurements of molecular species in a few or even single cells, and simultaneous measurement of multiple molecules, including proteins and RNAs, RNAs and DNA methylation or RNAs and chromatin accessibility158,159.",
              "These techniques are complemented by increasingly robust and predictive analytical tools160.",
              "Furthermore, techniques such as single-cell Hi-C can provide information on three-dimensional chromatin folding161,162,163,164, which can be complemented by high-content super-resolution microscopy and molecular modelling approaches165.",
              "Low-cell and single-cell studies allow the investigation of individual germline cells, mature gametes, zygotes and early stages of embryonic development166.",
              "The study of epigenetic inheritance also requires the ability to follow molecular changes through time and cell division.",
              "Recent progress in lineage-tracing techniques has been instrumental in accomplishing this goal, as such techniques allows cell pedigrees to be established.",
              "Early tracing techniques led to the labelling of one or a small group of cells.",
              "However, more recent approaches allow prospective multiplex tracing by introducing barcodes of essentially unlimited complexity into dividing cells, as well as retrospective tracing by extensive DNA sequencing and reconstruction of the history of acquisition of spontaneous mutations.",
              "The division tree of large cell populations can thus be reconstructed167.",
              "Coupling lineage tracing with single-cell \u2018omic\u2019 technologies thus promises to make it possible to understand the gene expression histories of cell lineages.",
              "These descriptive techniques can be complemented by the versatile toolbox of genome engineering technologies such as CRISPR\u2013Cas.",
              "It is possible to mutate the genome precisely, reversibly and at multiple sites simultaneously168.",
              "Furthermore, one can tether proteins of interest to selected genomic positions in order to silence or activate genes, to induce reversible changes in 3D chromatin architecture and to visualize loci of interest in live imaging experiments169,170.",
              "This surge in approaches and technologies is revolutionizing the ways in which epigenetic processes can be studied, understood and harnessed to understand biological and pathological processes and to develop novel therapeutic strategies.",

              "Epigenetics is the study of heritable and stable changes in gene expression that occur through alterations in the chromosome rather than in the DNA sequence.",
              "[1] Despite not directly altering the DNA sequence, epigenetic mechanisms can regulate gene expression through chemical modifications of DNA bases and changes to the chromosomal superstructure in which DNA is packaged.",
              "Briefly, negatively charged DNA is packaged around a positively charged histone protein octamer, which contains 2 copies of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.",
              "[2] This nucleoprotein complex is a nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin.",
              "[3] The nucleosomes of a continuous DNA polymer are connected by linker DNA and the complex is stabilized by histone protein H1.",
              "The aggregation of chromatin results in the formation of a chromosome.",
              "The chromatin of a chromosome exists as either loose, transcriptionally active euchromatin or dense, transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.",
              "[4] Chemical alterations to histone proteins can induce the formation of either the open euchromatin state, which facilitates gene expression by allowing transcription factors and enzymes to interact with the DNA, or the closed heterochromatin state, which suppresses gene expression by preventing initiation of transcription.",
              "In addition to histone changes, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism associated with gene silencing when the methylation occurs in CpG islands of promoter sequences.",
              "[5] Further, non-coding RNA sequences have shown to play a key role in the regulation of gene expression.",
              "[6] These epigenetic modifications can be induced by several factors including age, diet, smoking, stress, and disease state.",
              "[7][8] Epigenetic modifications are reversible, but they rarely remain through generations in humans despite persisting through multiple cycles of cell replication.",
              "[9] Epigenetic mechanisms form a layer of control within a cell that regulates gene expression and silencing.",
              "This control varies between tissues and plays an important role in cell differentiation.",
              "[10] Additionally, differences in gene expression between cells, which are driven by epigenetic modifications, result in the unique function of specific cell types.",
              "[11] Genome-wide patterns of DNA and histone modifications are established during early development and are maintained throughout multiple cell divisions.",
              "In cancer, the normal epigenetic patterns are disrupted resulting in the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes like CDKN2A.",
              "[12] Three different epigenetic mechanisms have been identified: DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing.",
              "Catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes, DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group directly to a cytosine nucleotide within a cytosine-guanine sequence (CpG), which are often surrounded by other CpG\u2019s forming a CpG island.",
              "CpG islands are common targets for epigenetic DNA methylation, notably the CpG islands within promoter regions.",
              "Indeed, it has been reported that around 70% of gene promotor regions lie within CpG islands.",
              "[13] Methylated cytosines within a promoter region recruit gene suppressor proteins and reduce interaction between the DNA and transcription factors.",
              "[14] Cytosine methylation also drives the formation of heterochromatin, so the nucleosome tightening prevents transcriptional machinery from interacting with the DNA.",
              "[15] As such, DNA methylation within promoter regions results in gene silencing.",
              "Cancers often show marked hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of proto-oncogenes, both of which contribute to tumor carcinogenesis.",
              "[15] This epigenetic mechanism also plays an important role in tissue-specific gene regulation, genomic imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation.",
              "[14] The second epigenetic mechanism is post-translational modifications to histone proteins.",
              "These modifications include enzyme-catalyzed acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, each of which alters the DNA-histone interactions in nucleosomes.",
              "[16] Histone acetylation often occurs at positively charged lysine residues which weakens the DNA-histone interactions, thus opening the chromatin and facilitating transcription.",
              "[17] For example, acetylation of lysine 9 and lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac, respectively) correlates with transcription activation.",
              "Histone methylation is more complex as it does not change the histone protein charge and can include the addition of 1-3 methyl groups to lysine and 1-2 methyl groups to arginine.",
              "[17] For example, methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me) is associated with transcription activation while trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) correlates with transcription repression.",
              "[18] Histone phosphorylation involves the addition of a negative phosphate group to the histone tail, but less is known of its function aside from phosphorylation of H2A(X) playing a role in the response to DNA damage and its subsequent repair.",
              "[19] Histone ubiquitylation involves the addition of a large ubiquitin molecule to lysine residues.",
              "Examples of histone ubiquitylation include H2AK119ub, which is associated with gene silencing, and H2BK123ub, which is involved in transcription.",
              "[17] Aside from the relatively straightforward effect of histone acetylation on gene expression, the effects of other histone modifications are complex and greatly influenced by the state of nearby DNA molecules.",
              "The most recently elucidated epigenetic mechanism is non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing.",
              "A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is transcribed but not translated into proteins.",
              "Once regarded as waste of the genome, recent insight suggests the ncRNA molecules harbor a crucial role in epigenetic gene expression and likely account for the great difference in phenotype between species and within human populations despite such similarity in encoded proteins.",
              "[6][18] Notable ncRNA molecules include microRNAs (miRNA) and short interfering RNAs (siRNA), which include less than 30 nucleotides, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which are 200 nucleotides or longer.",
              "Though the full extent of their role in epigenetics is still being determined, there is evidence suggesting that ncRNAs participate in DNA methylation and histone modifications in addition to gene silencing.",
              "[20] siRNAs and lncRNAs both have been shown to regulate gene expression by the formation of heterochromatin.",
              "[6][21] As people age, the largest influence on the epigenome is the environment.",
              "Direct influencers such as diet can affect one's epigenome, as determined by the Dutch famine studies.",
              "[22][23] Other environmental stressors include smoking and psychological stress.",
              "Epigenetic changes in utero are particularly sensitive as the epigenetic profile of the fetus is forming and developing rapidly during this time.",
              "[24] Indeed, teratogens like cigarette smoke, alcohol, and specific minerals have shown to induce in utero epigenetic changes.",
              "[24][25] Perhaps the most studied clinical application of epigenetic mechanisms is cancer.",
              "One of the first reports of epigenetics involved in cancer reported hypomethylation of DNA in cancer cell genomes, which caused overexpression of genes within that cell.",
              "[26] Since this report, great strides have been made toward understanding the role of epigenetics in carcinogenesis.",
              "For example, the degree of DNA methylation continues to decrease as a benign tumor cell progresses to invasive cancer.",
              "[27] Other studies have shown hypomethylation of pro-proliferative genes like BAX2 that are suppressed in normal cells.",
              "[28] Other reports show hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, like Rb, BCRA1, and CDKN2A, in cancer cells.",
              "[29][30][31] Despite the wealth of knowledge present on the relationship between epigenetics and carcinogenesis, treatment development is still very much in the preliminary phase for most cancers.",
              "Epigenetics is a promising field of research because of the potential to regulate gene expression without changing the DNA sequence, which may likely cause safety and ethical concerns if performed in humans.",
              "The most promising way to treat diseases through epigenetic regulation has been through pharmacology.",
              "Previous clinical trials for drugs formulated to block epigenetic modifications associated with cancers have proved successful.",
              "The FDA has approved a number of these drugs which target epigenetic regulators to treat various cancers including azacytidine and decitabine for myelodysplastic syndrome, panobinostat for multiple myeloma, and romidepsin for cutaneous T cell lymphoma.",
              "[32] More drugs are likely to be approved in the coming years as a number of clinical trials for DNA methylation inhibitors and histone modification inhibitors are underway.",
              "In addition to cancers, many conditions associated with genomic imprinting are the result of malfunctioning epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms can induce disease, but they are also necessary for normal cell function, specifically in imprinted genes where only one parental chromosome is expressed.",
              "For genomic imprinting to successfully occur, the other parental chromosome must be silenced, which occurs through DNA methylation.",
              "Noteworthy conditions associated with abnormalities in gene imprinting include Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, and Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome.",
              "[33][34] Recent studies have shown positive results for epigenetic-based therapies for imprinting disorders, which may be a field of increased focus in the coming years in search of better treatments.",

              "DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism, and its role in the pathogenesis of several diseases has been extensively studied.",
              "The process of DNA methylation consists of covalent binding of a methyl group to a cytosine residue in the DNA, where cytosines are followed by guanines (CpG sites).",
              "This chemical modification is mediated via a group of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).",

              "[12], the body mass index of pre-bariatric obese adults correlated negatively with LEP methylation and positively with adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) methylation measured in subcutaneous adipose tissues.",
              "Several other investigations have confirmed the association between obesity and the methylation status of LEP and ADIPOQ, which has been proposed to promote obesity-associated insulin resistance and metabolic derangements [13,14,15].",
              "DNA methylation also regulates genes involved in insulin signaling, such as insulin (INS) [16], insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) [17], and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit (PIK3R1) [18].",

              "The methylation of these two genes was disrupted in obesity, gestational diabetes, and high-fat feeding but was restored in response to caloric restriction [21,22,23].",

              "In addition, genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress such as TNF (tumor necrosis factor), IL6 (interleukin 6), and TFAM (mitochondrial transcription factor A) exhibited aberrant DNA methylation in obese individuals and correlated with abnormal expression and disturbed function of these genes [27,28,29].",
              "Collectively, obesity has been linked to altered DNA methylation patterns, which could serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",
              "These changes have been linked to a disrupted balance between DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and active demethylases such as TETs (Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1) [28,29,30,31].",

              "Although the development of methylation arrays has made DNA methylation analyses much more affordable, these arrays remain largely inefficient, covering less than 3% of the CpG sites in the human genome, even on the latest Illumina MethylationEPIC Beadchip [95].",
              "In addition, as the contents of these arrays were determined by expert panels, the selected CpG sites present a biased representation of the genome.",
              "In contrast, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is able to reveal methylation status at each cytosine across the whole genome, with approximately 95% of all CpG sites in the human genome assessable via WGBS [95].",
              "In fact, despite the value of higher resolution and unbiased coverage, the widespread utilization of WGBS has been hindered primarily by its high cost and the large DNA input required, compounded by the extensive computational power and expertise necessary for its accurate interpretation.",
              "The value of WGBS in the study of diabetes has been previously demonstrated by Jeon et al.",
              "who found a 10 kb stretch in the MSI2 gene displaying methylation differences strongly related to hyperglycemia in islet preparations from two donors with T2D and 16 non-diabetic donors [96], and Volkov et al.",
              "who identified >25,000 differentially methylated regions in islets from individuals with T2D covering loci with known islet function and binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for islet-specific transcription factors as well as enhancer regions [97].",
              "With maturation of the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology and improvements in library preparation methods [98], both the cost of WGBS and the DNA input amount necessary have greatly reduced, rendering this technology increasingly affordable for usage in EWAS and other studies.",
              "In our benchmarking study where we systematically compared the performance of three WGBS library preparation methods with low DNA input requirement (Swift Biosciences Accel-NGS, Illumina TruSeq and QIAGEN QIAseq) on two state-of-the-art sequencing platforms (Illumina NovaSeq and HiSeq X), we demonstrated that the Swift Accel-NGS library preparation method presented the best overall data quality, along with similar performance between NovaSeq and HiSeq X platforms [99].",
              "When we assessed concordance between data generated by WGBS and methylation arrays, we discovered systematic biases between WGBS and methylation arrays, with lower precision observed for WGBS across all depths investigated (10\u2013120x).",
              "To achieve a level of precision broadly comparable to the methylation array, a minimum coverage of 100x is recommended.",
              "Given the differential cost for sequencing at different depths, this has important implications for the design of future WGBS studies, in particular population-based studies on large cohorts.",
              "For example, to detect a difference of 1% in methylation levels between cases and controls, as was observed in previous T2D EWAS, a sample size of \u223c4,500 will be needed on the methylation array, and \u223c5,000 for WGBS at 100x coverage.",
              "For an average detectable difference of \u223c6% as reported to be observed in pancreatic islets, a sample size of 158 will suffice at 100x, or 384 at a more modest 30x coverage (Figure 2).",

              "[1] Despite not directly altering the DNA sequence, epigenetic mechanisms can regulate gene expression through chemical modifications of DNA bases and changes to the chromosomal superstructure in which DNA is packaged.",
              "Briefly, negatively charged DNA is packaged around a positively charged histone protein octamer, which contains 2 copies of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.",
              "[2] This nucleoprotein complex is a nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin.",
              "[3] The nucleosomes of a continuous DNA polymer are connected by linker DNA and the complex is stabilized by histone protein H1.",
              "The aggregation of chromatin results in the formation of a chromosome.",
              "The chromatin of a chromosome exists as either loose, transcriptionally active euchromatin or dense, transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin.",
              "[4] Chemical alterations to histone proteins can induce the formation of either the open euchromatin state, which facilitates gene expression by allowing transcription factors and enzymes to interact with the DNA, or the closed heterochromatin state, which suppresses gene expression by preventing initiation of transcription.",
              "In addition to histone changes, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism associated with gene silencing when the methylation occurs in CpG islands of promoter sequences.",
              "[5] Further, non-coding RNA sequences have shown to play a key role in the regulation of gene expression.",
              "[6] These epigenetic modifications can be induced by several factors including age, diet, smoking, stress, and disease state.",
              "[7][8] Epigenetic modifications are reversible, but they rarely remain through generations in humans despite persisting through multiple cycles of cell replication.",
              "[9] Epigenetic mechanisms form a layer of control within a cell that regulates gene expression and silencing.",
              "This control varies between tissues and plays an important role in cell differentiation.",
              "[10] Additionally, differences in gene expression between cells, which are driven by epigenetic modifications, result in the unique function of specific cell types.",
              "[11] Genome-wide patterns of DNA and histone modifications are established during early development and are maintained throughout multiple cell divisions.",
              "In cancer, the normal epigenetic patterns are disrupted resulting in the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes like CDKN2A.",
              "[12] Three different epigenetic mechanisms have been identified: DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing.",
              "Catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes, DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group directly to a cytosine nucleotide within a cytosine-guanine sequence (CpG), which are often surrounded by other CpG\u2019s forming a CpG island.",

              "[13] Methylated cytosines within a promoter region recruit gene suppressor proteins and reduce interaction between the DNA and transcription factors.",
              "[14] Cytosine methylation also drives the formation of heterochromatin, so the nucleosome tightening prevents transcriptional machinery from interacting with the DNA.",
              "[15] As such, DNA methylation within promoter regions results in gene silencing.",
              "Cancers often show marked hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylation of proto-oncogenes, both of which contribute to tumor carcinogenesis.",
              "[15] This epigenetic mechanism also plays an important role in tissue-specific gene regulation, genomic imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation.",
              "[14] The second epigenetic mechanism is post-translational modifications to histone proteins.",
              "These modifications include enzyme-catalyzed acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, each of which alters the DNA-histone interactions in nucleosomes.",
              "[16] Histone acetylation often occurs at positively charged lysine residues which weakens the DNA-histone interactions, thus opening the chromatin and facilitating transcription.",
              "[17] For example, acetylation of lysine 9 and lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K9ac and H3K27ac, respectively) correlates with transcription activation.",
              "Histone methylation is more complex as it does not change the histone protein charge and can include the addition of 1-3 methyl groups to lysine and 1-2 methyl groups to arginine.",
              "[17] For example, methylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me) is associated with transcription activation while trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) correlates with transcription repression.",
              "[18] Histone phosphorylation involves the addition of a negative phosphate group to the histone tail, but less is known of its function aside from phosphorylation of H2A(X) playing a role in the response to DNA damage and its subsequent repair.",
              "[19] Histone ubiquitylation involves the addition of a large ubiquitin molecule to lysine residues.",
              "Examples of histone ubiquitylation include H2AK119ub, which is associated with gene silencing, and H2BK123ub, which is involved in transcription.",
              "[17] Aside from the relatively straightforward effect of histone acetylation on gene expression, the effects of other histone modifications are complex and greatly influenced by the state of nearby DNA molecules.",
              "The most recently elucidated epigenetic mechanism is non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing.",
              "A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is transcribed but not translated into proteins.",
              "Once regarded as waste of the genome, recent insight suggests the ncRNA molecules harbor a crucial role in epigenetic gene expression and likely account for the great difference in phenotype between species and within human populations despite such similarity in encoded proteins.",
              "[6][18] Notable ncRNA molecules include microRNAs (miRNA) and short interfering RNAs (siRNA), which include less than 30 nucleotides, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), which are 200 nucleotides or longer.",
              "Though the full extent of their role in epigenetics is still being determined, there is evidence suggesting that ncRNAs participate in DNA methylation and histone modifications in addition to gene silencing.",
              "[20] siRNAs and lncRNAs both have been shown to regulate gene expression by the formation of heterochromatin.",
              "[6][21] As people age, the largest influence on the epigenome is the environment.",
              "Direct influencers such as diet can affect one's epigenome, as determined by the Dutch famine studies.",
              "[22][23] Other environmental stressors include smoking and psychological stress.",
              "Epigenetic changes in utero are particularly sensitive as the epigenetic profile of the fetus is forming and developing rapidly during this time.",
              "[24] Indeed, teratogens like cigarette smoke, alcohol, and specific minerals have shown to induce in utero epigenetic changes.",
              "[24][25] Perhaps the most studied clinical application of epigenetic mechanisms is cancer.",
              "One of the first reports of epigenetics involved in cancer reported hypomethylation of DNA in cancer cell genomes, which caused overexpression of genes within that cell.",
              "[26] Since this report, great strides have been made toward understanding the role of epigenetics in carcinogenesis.",
              "For example, the degree of DNA methylation continues to decrease as a benign tumor cell progresses to invasive cancer.",
              "[27] Other studies have shown hypomethylation of pro-proliferative genes like BAX2 that are suppressed in normal cells.",
              "[28] Other reports show hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, like Rb, BCRA1, and CDKN2A, in cancer cells.",
              "[29][30][31] Despite the wealth of knowledge present on the relationship between epigenetics and carcinogenesis, treatment development is still very much in the preliminary phase for most cancers.",
              "Epigenetics is a promising field of research because of the potential to regulate gene expression without changing the DNA sequence, which may likely cause safety and ethical concerns if performed in humans.",
              "The most promising way to treat diseases through epigenetic regulation has been through pharmacology.",
              "Previous clinical trials for drugs formulated to block epigenetic modifications associated with cancers have proved successful.",
              "The FDA has approved a number of these drugs which target epigenetic regulators to treat various cancers including azacytidine and decitabine for myelodysplastic syndrome, panobinostat for multiple myeloma, and romidepsin for cutaneous T cell lymphoma.",
              "[32] More drugs are likely to be approved in the coming years as a number of clinical trials for DNA methylation inhibitors and histone modification inhibitors are underway.",
              "In addition to cancers, many conditions associated with genomic imprinting are the result of malfunctioning epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms can induce disease, but they are also necessary for normal cell function, specifically in imprinted genes where only one parental chromosome is expressed.",
              "For genomic imprinting to successfully occur, the other parental chromosome must be silenced, which occurs through DNA methylation.",
              "Noteworthy conditions associated with abnormalities in gene imprinting include Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, and Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome.",
              "[33][34] Recent studies have shown positive results for epigenetic-based therapies for imprinting disorders, which may be a field of increased focus in the coming years in search of better treatments.",

              "These marks change the spatial conformation of chromatin: either compacting it, thereby preventing the binding of transcription factors to the DNA, or opening it, allowing transcription factor binding and usually upregulating cellular processes.",

              "Acetylation of histone tails is controlled by two enzyme families: histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which transfer an acetyl group, and histone deacetylases (HDACs) [4,5,6], which remove acetyl groups.",
              "Other epigenetic marks are also described and include histone post-translational modifications such as methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, phosphorylation, biotinylation, and ADP-ribosylation, which either promote or suppress gene expression.",
              "The pattern of these marks on histone tails is often referred to as the histone code, which dictates the binding of effector proteins that in turn results in specific cellular processes.",
              "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are another type of specific epigenetic mark that mediate various intracellular processes [7].",
              "A ncRNA is a functional RNA molecule transcribed from DNA but not translated into protein.",
              "The best characterized ncRNAs are microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short, single-stranded, 19\u201324 nucleotide ncRNAs.",

              "With little or no protein-coding potential, lncRNAs instead participate in various intracellular processes [7], and recent studies have identified that certain lncRNAs are specifically associated with certain cancers [9].",
              "With the development of high-resolution sequencing and high-throughput technologies, a large number of biologically functional ncRNAs have now been identified [10].",
              "In addition, there is crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modifications [11];",
              "for example, histone methyltransferases, histone demethylases, and accessory proteins interact and coordinate the chromatin state and DNA methylation and methylation status of histones are tightly associated [12].",
              "Moreover, various ncRNAs are also closely associated with other epigenetic marks, which form extensive crosstalk throughout the cell, or the \u201cepigenetic network\u201d [7].",
              "There is now plenty of evidence that the epigenetic control of the genome is far more complicated than first thought and involves multiple epigenetic mechanisms and their interactions [12,13].",

              "Behavior, nutrition, and exposure to toxins and pollutants are among the lifestyle factors known to be associated with epigenetic modifications.",
              "For example, nutrition is a key environmental exposure from gestation to death that impacts our health by influencing epigenetic phenomena.",
              "In another example, recent epidemiological data suggest that the increased incidence of cancer observed in the developed world since the 1960s may partly be due to exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), to which humans and wildlife are exposed daily from multiple sources.",
              "These are discussed in detail below.",
              "Cancer is the second most common cause of death in most countries and will remain so as elderly people are most susceptible to cancer and the population is rapidly aging, at least in the west.",
              "While age-standardized cancer mortality rates are projected to decrease in the European Union (EU) [17,18] and the United States (US) [19,20] due to advances in screening, prevention, and treatment, the incidence has increased in Europe and the US for testicular and prostate cancers over the last 50 years [21,22,23].",
              "In the United Kingdom (UK), the combined incidence of all cancers has increased for all age groups since the early 1990s, with the greatest increase seen in young people aged 0\u201324 years.",

              "Nutrition is one of the most studied and better understood environmental epigenetic factors.",
              "Associations have been observed between adverse prenatal nutritional conditions, postnatal health, and increased risk of disease.",
              "For instance, at its extreme, the Dutch Famine Birth Cohort resulting from the Dutch Famine of 1944\u20131945 has been used to study the effects of starvation during pregnancy and subsequent health and developmental outcomes including, but not limited to, increased risk of type II diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, and decreased cognitive function in later life [24,25,26].",
              "The first months of pregnancy seem to have the greatest effect on disease risk;",
              "children conceived during the Dutch Famine tended to have smaller-than-usual offspring, suggesting that effects may persist and impact our children and even beyond.",
              "It seems likely that the fetus epigenetically adapts in response to a limited supply of nutrients.",
              "In humans, persistent epigenetic differences associated with prenatal exposure to famine have been ascribed to a lower degree of methylation of a gene implicated in insulin metabolism than their unexposed siblings [27].",
              "The evidence for transgenerational effects of poor maternal diet on human populations with respect to metabolic outcomes was examined in [28].",
              "There is evidence from historical records that the grandchildren of women exposed to famine and other dietary alterations during pregnancy are more likely to experience health complications than their control counterparts.",
              "The potential molecular mechanisms of transgenerational inheritance suggest methylation of gametes via the paternal and maternal lineage [28].",
              "Indeed, further transmission via the paternal line is highly likely to occur via epigenetic modulation of the spermatozoan nucleus.",
              "Two examples from historical cohorts illustrate this transgenerational transmission via the paternal lineage.",
              "One showed that female grandchildren (F2) from the paternal grandmother (F0) who experienced poor food availability during her own growth were at higher risk of cardiovascular mortality.",
              "The second more recent example showed that adult grand-offspring whose fathers were exposed to famine in utero had higher BMIs than a control population.",
              "The evidence that both maternal and paternal diets influence metabolic phenotypes in offspring in mammals through epigenetic information transmission is reviewed in [29].",
              "Over molecular mechanisms with respect to the fetal origins of adult disease have been suggested including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as among the earliest events described in offspring exposed to nutrient restriction [29].",
              "Nutrition in early life induces long-term changes in DNA methylation that impact on individual health and age-related diseases throughout life [11,30].",
              "Nutrients can either act directly by inhibiting epigenetic enzymes such as DNMT, HDAC, or HAT or by altering the availability of substrate necessary for those enzymatic reactions.",
              "This in turn modifies the expression of critical genes and impacting on our overall health and longevity (see [12,31] for reviews).",
              "A number of studies have reported the epigenetic effects of diet on phenotype and susceptibility to diseases throughout life.",
              "Folate metabolism is linked to phenotypic changes through DNA methylation, as folate, a water-soluble B vitamin, is a source of one-carbon for the synthesis of AdoMet, which is necessary for DNA methylation [12,30,31].",
              "Other methyl donor nutrients such as choline can also alter the DNA methylation status and subsequently impact gene expression [12].",
              "Maternal methyl donor nutrient availability in early pregnancy is essential for proper fetal development, with consequences for health and disease susceptibility or cancer in the children throughout life.",
              "In one animal study, a maternal diet restricted in methyl nutrients during periconception affected DNA methylation patterns in offspring and was the cause of altered phenotypes [12].",
              "Conversely, dietary restriction but without severe nutritional deprivation has been shown in several models to extend lifespan [32].",
              "Calorie restriction has an anti-inflammatory effect through the inhibitory effects of critical genes not limited to NF-\u03baB [12].",
              "From the epigenetic standpoint, there is clear crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modifications [11], suggesting that the chromatin structure may also determine DNA methylation [11].",
              "In this context of epigenetic interactions, sirtuin 1, a NAD+-dependent HDAC whose substrate specificity includes histone proteins, has been suggested to be activated by some dietary components (for example resveratrol, a type of natural phenol present in grape skins).",
              "Sirtuin 1 mediates some of the effects of dietary restriction that delay or reverse some of the physiological changes associated with aging through effects on DNA methylation [32].",
              "Diets high in these methyl-donating nutrients can rapidly impact gene expression, especially during early development when the epigenome is first established, and can have long-lasting effects in adult life.",
              "Studies in animals have reported that diets poor in methyl-donating folate or choline before or just after birth cause permanent hypomethylation of parts of the genome.",
              "In adults, a methyl-deficient diet decreases DNA methylation, but the changes are reversible when methyl is added back into the diet.",
              "Further, depending on the dietary supplements received by a pregnant mouse, her offspring may have a different phenotype due to differential gene methylation.",
              "In an example of epigenome-modifying chemicals, bisphenol A (BPA) is widely used to manufacture numerous plastic products including containers.",
              "The pups of adult mice fed BPA were more likely to have an unhealthy phenotype (yellow/obese, prone to cancer and diabetes) compared to those born from mothers fed BPA with supplemented methyl-rich nutrients like folic acid and vitamin B12 (brown, thin and healthy).",
              "In this case, maternal nutrient supplementation counteracted the negative effects of chemical exposure, underscoring the importance of a good diet rich in fruit and vegetables and other high-quality foods.",
              "Methyl-donating nutrients act as co-substrates for methyl group transfers;",
              "the pool of available methyl donors is an important regulator of both DNA and histone methylation capacity [33] and their production is also dependent on BPA\u2019s epigenetic effects.",
              "In this mouse model, altered DNA hypomethylation could be alleviated by folic acid as a dietary methyl donor.",
              "Another striking example of the effects of early diets on epigenetics with consequences on the phenotype can be found in honey bees.",
              "The sterile worker bee differentiates from the fertile queen depending on the larval diet through epigenetic changes in DNA methylation patterns.",
              "Larvae designated to become queens are fed exclusively with royal jelly, which contains epigenetically active ingredients that silences a key gene which itself silences a group of queen genes [12].",
              "Furthermore, DNA methylation changes occur during ageing, and it has become evident that early life nutrition can modulate DNA methylation and influence longevity, in particular by inducing long-term changes in DNA methylation and other marks that affect susceptibility to a range of ageing-associated diseases [11];",
              "that is, a form of \u201ccellular memory\u201d (see [32] for a review).",
              "In this regard, the lifespan of a queen bee is up to twenty times that of a worker.",
              "Folic acid and vitamin B12 are two examples of epigenetically active ingredients that play important roles in DNA metabolism and the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns via chemical reaction of a methyl product.",
              "In one in vivo study, dietary folate intake was positively correlated with p16 tumor suppressor gene expression, a critical cancer-associated gene with frequent silencing DNA methylation of its promoter [12].",
              "Altered p16 gene expression was observed in aged mouse colons, consistent with the known decrease in DNMT expression with aging.",
              "Low folate intake has been associated with hypomethylation and an increased risk of colorectal and pancreatic cancers [9,34].",
              "There is a growing body of epidemiological evidence that folate modulates anticarcinogenic properties through epigenetic changes, as folate deficiency reduces the potential for DNA methylation, and abnormal DNA methylation is associated with many types of cancer.",
              "Diets rich in fruits and vegetables containing natural anti-oxidants can protect against cancer.",
              "The potential epigenetic effects of several nutritional components in addition to folate, mostly derived from vegetables, have been examined in a number of studies, which have shown reductions in DNA hypermethylation of critical genes resulting in tumor suppression [32,35].",

              "The pluripotency of the initial cell and the establishment of cell types depend to a large extent on the coordinated deployment of hundreds of transcription factors that bind to specific DNA sequences to activate or repress the transcription of cell lineage genes1.",
              "This establishment phase corresponds most closely to what is generally cited as the first definition of epigenetics by Conrad Waddington, namely the study of the mechanisms by which the genotype produces the phenotype in the context of development2.",
              "The maintenance phase often involves a plethora of non-DNA sequence specific chromatin cofactors that set up and maintain chromatin states through cell division and for extended periods of time\u2014sometimes in the absence of the initial transcription factors3.",
              "This phase is more akin to a definition of epigenetics put forward by Nanney4, then elaborated on by Riggs and Holliday5,6,7 and further modified by Bird8 and others9 to mean the inheritance of alternative chromatin states in the absence of changes in the DNA sequence.",
              "DNA methylation was proposed early on as a carrier of epigenetic information with subsequent work revealing that chromatin proteins and noncoding RNAs are also important for this process10,11,12,13,14.",

              "Such modifications can be heritable but reversible and are governed by a series of writers (that deposit them), readers (to interpret them) and erasers (to remove them).",
              "Finally, higher-order 3D chromosome folding is also thought to modulate gene expression and might contribute to inheritance15.",

              "In doing so, they constitute barriers against accidental reprogramming that maintain developmental and physiological homeostasis.",
              "Altered epigenomes can lead to changes in programmed cell differentiation or, when accidental, to disease (bottom right).",
              "Germline reprogramming resets the majority (but not all) of the epigenome to achieve reproduction (top right).",
              "Since 1942, when the word was first coined, epigenetics has been redefined multiple times16 (Table 1).",
              "In this Review, we use epigenetics to mean \u201cthe study of molecules and mechanisms that can perpetuate alternative gene activity states in the context of the same DNA sequence\u201d.",
              "This operational definition has several implications.",
              "First, it encompasses transgenerational inheritance as well as mitotic inheritance and the persistence of gene activity or chromatin states through extended periods of time, even without cell division\u2014for instance, in long-lived post-mitotic cells such as adult neurons.",
              "Second, the DNA sequence to be considered depends on the biological system.",
              "In mitotic inheritance, one should consider the genomic sequence of individual cells, whereas in transgenerational inheritance one should consider the DNA of the whole organism (including its microbiota, if this can contribute to inheritance).",
              "Finally, this definition explicitly extends the usage of \u2018epigenetic\u2019 to regulatory processes that involve molecules known to participate in epigenetic inheritance, even when not addressing the epigenetic memory function per se.",
              "We argue that this common practice should be accepted, as it conveys to non-specialists the broader field of epigenetic research.",
              "We also note that cases of inheritance that do not involve chromosomal components have been documented14,17,18 and it will be important to study how widespread they are and whether similar phenomena occur in humans.",
              "Here, we review the interplay between regulatory plasticity and stable epigenetic heritability, including cell fate and reprogramming events that occur during development, in response to physiological stimuli, and in disease.",
              "We discuss how noncoding RNAs, DNA methylation, heterochromatin, Polycomb and Trithorax proteins and 3D genome architecture (Box 1) can regulate both inheritance and gene expression plasticity, and how new technologies allow these phenomena to be analysed in a spatiotemporal fashion, in small numbers of cells or even single cells, and at multiple scales from the nucleotide to the chromosome (Box 2).",
              "We discuss evidence for a hotly debated topic\u2014epigenetic inheritance across generations\u2014particularly focusing on mammalian examples because of the potential biomedical implications.",
              "We also consider two other important new research areas: the potential influence of the environment and the effects of epigenetic changes on genome integrity.",
              "In closing, we highlight how epigenetic research may benefit human health.",
              "Heterochromatin components Pericentric heterochromatin contains a large number of proteins, but its most distinctive feature is the presence of megabase-sized repetitive DNA domains coated in a specific histone H3K9 trimethylation mark, which is deposited by the enzymes SUV39 and SETDB1.",
              "This mark is bound by the chromo domain of SUV39H1, which stimulates catalytic activity of the enzyme152.",
              "Furthermore, the same mark is bound by the HP1 protein, which can bridge adjacent nucleosomes153.",
              "Therefore, heterochromatin components can both write and read the H3K9me3 mark and compact their target chromatin.",
              "Heterochromatin factors also collaborate with RNAi in plants, yeast and some animals to convey epigenetic inheritance.",
              "Polycomb proteins Early genetic studies classified Polycomb (PcG) and Trithorax into two antagonistic groups that maintain the memory of spatial patterns of expression of homeotic genes throughout development.",
              "These complexes also have key roles in the maintenance of developmentally or environmentally programmed expression states, such as X-chromosome inactivation or cold-induced vernalization in plants3.",
              "PcG proteins are found in two main classes of complex\u2014PRC2 and PRC1\u2014that are responsible for deposition of the H3K27me3 and H2AK119Ub marks via EZH2 and RING1A/1B, respectively3.",
              "PcG proteins can be recruited to specific regions of the genome by DNA-binding proteins or noncoding RNAs3.",
              "PRC2 complexes contain a writer, the histone methyltransferase enzyme EZH2 (or its less efficient paralogue EZH1), and a reader, the EED subunit.",
              "Similar to HP1, CBX subunits of PRC1 complexes contain a chromodomain that specifically recognizes H3K27me3.",
              "Finally, another PRC1 subunit, PHC1-3, can oligomerize and induce 3D clustering in nuclear foci in vivo3.",
              "Noncoding RNAs Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) belong to several classes, and neither their production nor their functions can be generalized.",
              "Many ncRNAs, such as microRNAs, regulate post-transcriptional processes, whereas others are involved in transcriptional regulation.",
              "Short noncoding RNAs, such as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), are shorter than 30 nucleotides, whereas long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) vary in size (up to more than 100 kilobases).",
              "The best characterized of these is probably the X-inactive specific transcript (Xist)154.",
              "Many short ncRNAs act within or outside chromatin, and some, for example siRNAs and tRNA fragments, can diffuse extracellularly14, whereas many nuclear lncRNAs are chromatin-associated.",
              "Enhancer RNAs can activate genes155, but most short and long ncRNAs are repressive, act via chromatin (H3K9me3, Polycomb) or DNA methylation154,156, and can induce epigenetic memory by building self-enforcing loops with heterochromatin or the RNAi machinery.",
              "They are also involved in the regulation of higher-order chromatin architecture.",
              "DNA methylation The mechanisms that allow DNA methylation to be copied during DNA replication represent one of the best-understood epigenetic systems, and involve specific proteins that recognize CpG hemi-methylated DNA and thereby redeposit DNA methylation on newly replicated DNA.",
              "DNA methylation is maintained by the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 and its partner UHRF1 (also known as NP95), which specifically binds hemimethylated DNA and stimulates DNMT1 via its ubiquitin ligase activity (Fig.",
              "2).",
              "Therefore, as recently reviewed in detail157, a single complex contains both the \u2018writer\u2019 and the \u2018reader\u2019 of the epigenetic methyl CpG mark, and both moieties are essential for the maintenance of DNA methylation.",
              "The understanding of epigenetic inheritance requires the ability to tell whether progenies retain parental phenotypes.",
              "Early studies on mitotic inheritance were severely hampered by limitations in describing the molecular states of individual cells.",
              "However, modern low-cell and single-cell technologies are allowing high-throughput quantitative measurements of molecular species in a few or even single cells, and simultaneous measurement of multiple molecules, including proteins and RNAs, RNAs and DNA methylation or RNAs and chromatin accessibility158,159.",
              "These techniques are complemented by increasingly robust and predictive analytical tools160.",
              "Furthermore, techniques such as single-cell Hi-C can provide information on three-dimensional chromatin folding161,162,163,164, which can be complemented by high-content super-resolution microscopy and molecular modelling approaches165.",
              "Low-cell and single-cell studies allow the investigation of individual germline cells, mature gametes, zygotes and early stages of embryonic development166.",
              "The study of epigenetic inheritance also requires the ability to follow molecular changes through time and cell division.",
              "Recent progress in lineage-tracing techniques has been instrumental in accomplishing this goal, as such techniques allows cell pedigrees to be established.",
              "Early tracing techniques led to the labelling of one or a small group of cells.",
              "However, more recent approaches allow prospective multiplex tracing by introducing barcodes of essentially unlimited complexity into dividing cells, as well as retrospective tracing by extensive DNA sequencing and reconstruction of the history of acquisition of spontaneous mutations.",
              "The division tree of large cell populations can thus be reconstructed167.",
              "Coupling lineage tracing with single-cell \u2018omic\u2019 technologies thus promises to make it possible to understand the gene expression histories of cell lineages.",
              "These descriptive techniques can be complemented by the versatile toolbox of genome engineering technologies such as CRISPR\u2013Cas.",
              "It is possible to mutate the genome precisely, reversibly and at multiple sites simultaneously168.",
              "Furthermore, one can tether proteins of interest to selected genomic positions in order to silence or activate genes, to induce reversible changes in 3D chromatin architecture and to visualize loci of interest in live imaging experiments169,170.",
              "This surge in approaches and technologies is revolutionizing the ways in which epigenetic processes can be studied, understood and harnessed to understand biological and pathological processes and to develop novel therapeutic strategies.",
              "An appreciation of the role of chromatin as a carrier of epigenetic information that can propagate active and silent activity states during cell division came from the study of different biological processes and model organisms. These include, to name but a few, heterochromatin inheritance in yeast, X-chromosome inactivation (the process by which one of the copies of the female X chromosome is silenced), or genomic imprinting (the parent-of-origin-specific repression of certain genes) in mammals;",

              "Studies of cellular reprogramming in the germline and early embryogenesis19,20,21,22, during induced pluripotency (iPS)23,24, or upon somatic nuclear transfer25,26 have shown that chromatin and DNA methylation act as important \u2018epigenetic barriers\u2019 (Fig.",
              "1) that prevent changes in gene expression and cell identity.",
              "Epigenetic systems (Box 1) include heterochromatin (HP1 and H3K9me3 (trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9)), Polycomb (PRC1 and PRC2) and Trithorax (COMPASS (complex proteins associated with SET1)) complexes.",
              "These complexes are thought to perpetuate functional responses by modifying histone proteins in chromatin and by binding their own histone marks in order to convey stable inheritance.",
              "Indeed, nucleosomes are subject to constant remodelling, histones are exchanged and all DNA and histone marks discovered so far are reversible, although the rates of exchange and the stability of the marks vary in different genomic domains27.",
              "Therefore, most regulatory signals would be rapidly lost in the absence of tight self-reinforcing loops that maintain the memory of the chromatin state28.",
              "Furthermore, the inheritance of epigenetic marks through cell division requires that they survive DNA replication and mitosis (Fig.",
              "2).",
              "This is particularly relevant for histone modifications, because nucleosomes do not have a DNA template-based duplication system.",
              "Deposition of parental H3 and H4 histones occurs within few hundred base pairs of their pre-replication position and, upon replication, they are roughly equally distributed to the leading and the lagging strand daughter DNA molecules, through the action of dedicated molecular complexes29,30.",

              "Loss of the target DNA sequence elements results in loss of PcG proteins and of gene silencing within a few cell divisions in Drosophila35,36, although sequence-independent propagation of silencing can be maintained in mammalian cell culture37.",
              "Mitotic retention of regulatory components (Fig.",

              "Owing to the lack of a precise \u2018replication\u2019 process for parental nucleosomes and to the loss of many DNA-binding factors and chromatin-associated components during mitosis and meiosis, the inheritance of single nucleosome marks poses specific challenges28.",

              "Indeed, the genome is now known to be hierarchically organized in a series of 3D structures, starting from nucleosome clutches, to chromatin loops, to chromosomal domains called topologically associating domains (TADs), and finally to active or repressive compartments and chromosome territories15,46,48,49,50.",
              "TADs and compartments might stabilize functional states and drive their own inheritance.",
              "Furthermore, multiple epigenetic machineries often act together to stabilize heritable states.",
              "For example, PRC2 collaborates with PRC1 complexes and DNA methylation is sustained by heterochromatin proteins and/or small RNA pathways51.",
              "In summary, epigenetic inheritance can involve multiple layers;",
              "and usually entails the cooperation of partially overlapping signals, initially dependent on DNA sequence (elicited by transcription factor binding or RNA-mediated mechanisms).",
              "Each of these layers adds a degree of stability, but each of them is also reversible, allowing plasticity in the presence of regulatory cues47,52.",
              "The inheritance of chromatin states in the absence of chromatin domains, or without self-reinforcing mechanisms, is more challenging28.",

              "As CTCF can affect 3D genome architecture and gene expression, this finding suggests that rewiring of epigenomic landscapes might frequently occur as a consequence of mutations.",
              "On the other hand, mutations that affect histone and DNA methyltransferases, or demethylases (TET enzymes), chromatin remodellers and other chromatin factors including histones, are frequently found in disease57 and their effects may be specifically targeted by therapeutic interventions58.",
              "The often cryptic relationship between DNA sequence and epigenetic changes can mean that mutations may be overlooked or mistaken for epimutations, leading to misconceptions about the driver versus passenger role for epigenetic changes59.",
