    "query": "What is the most effective way to design a sustainable and eco-friendly building, and how have architects and engineers incorporated these principles into their designs?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Designing a sustainable and eco-friendly building involves following some key principles that aim to reduce the environmental impact and improve the well-being of the occupants. According to Wikipedia[^1^], sustainable design seeks to reduce the consumption of non-renewable resources, minimize waste, and create healthy, productive environments. Some of the main principles of sustainable design are[^5^]:\n\n- Energy efficiency and conservation: measures to reduce energy consumption and maximize the efficiency of the energy used.\n- Renewable energy: using renewable energy like solar and wind power to meet the needs of the building in whole or in part.\n- Effective use of water: water use reduction efficiency and greywater recycling.\n- Effective waste and emissions management: use of measures to reduce waste generation and facilitate reuse and recycling. Implementation of measures to minimize or offset emissions and pollution, especially air and water pollution.\n- Sustainable construction materials: the building is built with materials that are non-toxic, ethically, and sustainably sourced from suppliers with the least environmental impact.\n- Environmentally conscious construction methods: the use of construction techniques that focus on reducing the impact of construction on the surrounding natural environment by reducing noise and light pollution and protecting local flora and fauna from harm during the construction phase.\n- Harmonious design: buildings designed to make the most of features like natural lighting and ventilation for heating/cooling. Designed to fit harmoniously into the surrounding natural environment and contribute to the preservation of local ecology.\n\nArchitects and engineers have incorporated these principles into their designs in various ways, depending on the context, budget, and goals of each project. Some examples of eco-friendly buildings from around the world are[^2^]:\n\n- Pixel Building (Melbourne, Australia): This office building was Australia\u2019s first carbon-neutral building, generating all its own power and water on site. It has colorful panels that provide shade and maximize daylight, supports that help process wastewater, a roof that captures rainwater, and vertical wind turbines.\n- One Central Park (Sydney, Australia): This residential building features vertical gardens on the facade that cover 250 species of Australian plants and flowers. They provide shade, beauty, and a statement of sustainability. The building also has a hovering cantilever that holds solar panels and a heliostat system that reflects sunlight into the building and surrounding areas.\n- Bahrain World Trade Center 1 and 2 (Bahrain): These twin towers have three giant wind turbines between them that generate up to 15% of the buildings\u2019 electricity needs. The towers are also shaped to funnel wind towards the turbines, maximizing their efficiency.",

              "\ud83d\udd51 Reading time: 1 minute The building construction sector is a significant contributor to the overall global carbon emissions.",
              "This includes the emissions during the construction phase as well as throughout the building's operational life.",
              "The construction phase comprises emissions due to equipment, heavy machinery, and the vehicles used for transportation of the building materials.",
              "During the operational life, electricity, power requirements, and maintenance are a big part of the building's carbon emissions.",
              "Moreover, buildings contribute to carbon emissions, even when they are demolished.",
              "Almost half of the greenhouse gas emissions are generated from the urban construction sector.",
              "Therefore, it is of utmost importance to consider the construction of buildings with minimal carbon footprint.",
              "The Pixel building in Melbourne, Australia, is one such epitome of sustainable construction.",
              "The carbon-neutral Pixel building was constructed in July 2010.",
              "The building was developed to support the changing business practices and provide a dynamic work environment.",
              "The idea for the project was conceived to create a structure capable of minimizing the carbon emissions generated during and after its life span.",
              "The building will offset all of the carbon used in its construction over time and generate energy back to the grid.",
              "The Pixel building has managed to keep a check on its carbon emissions, which is significantly less than that of ordinary buildings.",
              "The building has secured the highest LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) ratings.",
              "These rating systems are highly systematic and reliable.",
              "A brief explanation of the same is given in the FAQ section at the bottom of the article.",
              "The roof of the Pixel building is installed with wind turbines and solar panels.",
              "The panels with solar tracking system can generate 6.",
              "3 kW of electricity, while the wind turbines have an installed capacity of 5 kW.",
              "The building has reduced dependence on other external sources of energy and is quite self-sufficient.",
              "It fulfills most of its energy requirements without affecting the environment.",
              "Rainwater harvesting is commonly used as an additional source of water in many buildings.",
              "The Pixel building is also equipped with special tanks to collect and treat the stored water to be distributed across washrooms and other areas.",
              "The leftover wastewater (also known as Grey wastewater) is used for watering the plants.",
              "Refrigerants such as CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), hydro-fluorocarbons, and halons form an integral part of various cooling systems such as air conditioners and refrigerators.",
              "These refrigerants are infamous for their adverse effects on the ozone layer of the atmosphere.",
              "To tackle this, the Pixel building does not depend on air conditioners and utilizes Ammonia refrigerant.",
              "This ammonia refrigerant has zero impact on the environment as it does not deplete the ozone layer and is a reliable substitute for CFCs.",
              "Cement is a fundamental element of any concrete mix.",
              "Its production includes the manufacturing of clinker by calcination in large kilns at temperatures as high as 1450\u00b0C.",
              "This process alone generates a considerable amount of carbon emissions;",
              "therefore, cement is responsible for around 8% of the world's CO2 emissions.",
              "Therefore, the Pixel building utilized a unique concrete mix called 'Pixelcrete'.",
              "With nearly 60% less cement than a traditional concrete mix, it has helped in significantly reducing the building's carbon footprint.",
              "Besides, the aggregate used in this mix was recycled.",
              "The Pixel building is unique in yet another aspect.",
              "For instance, it does not have several fans on each floor and instead has only two fans\u2014one for the supply of fresh air, and the second one for releasing the fully exhausted air out of the building.",
              "The air entering the building from the outside is heated or cooled, as per the requirement, by a gas-fired ammonia absorption heat pump.",
              "Absorption heat pumps are beneficial in situations where both heating and cooling is required.",
              "In an ammonia heat pump, ammonia acts as the refrigerant when cooler air is needed, while water acts as an absorption medium by giving out substantial heat when warmer air is required.",
              "The building features thermally active floors with vents responsible for circulating the pre-conditioned air evenly on each floor.",
              "The individual exhaust vents located in the ceilings carry the exhausted air to the main exhaust fan.",
              "In this manner, fresh and conditioned air is circulated throughout the building without affecting the environment.",
              "A share of the treated rainwater is sent to the vacuum flush toilets in the building.",
              "These vacuum flush toilets use air suction to remove fecal waste and minimize water usage.",
              "Although, setting up a vacuum flushing system requires some level of expertise, it is an excellent initiative towards a greener outlook.",
              "The roof of the Pixel building also has a small anaerobic digester that receives the waste from the vacuum flush and effectively produces biogas from it.",
              "This sewage then goes directly towards the sewer pipelines.",
              "Overall, this digester ensures that no form of energy remains unused from within the building.",
              "The Pixel building was constructed with a focus on carbon balance rather than energy and is therefore energy-positive but carbon neutral.",
              "Its design incorporates energy-efficient components in the facade and services to minimize electricity required for lighting, heating, cooling, and ventilation.",
              "Apart from the entire building using only two fans, it also utilizes LED lights for non-office areas, an external shading system to reduce solar thermal loads, and an individually addressable dimming system.",
              "Grey water waste is the waste water generated from any building\u2019s occupants, other than the fecal waste.",
              "All other uses of water such as washing hands, washing utensils, bathing etc.",
              "constitute grey water waste.",
              "This waste water is not as toxic as the sewage waste (black water waste) and requires little to no chemical treatment.",
              "Sometimes, this water is used for other purposes such as watering the garden or plants, which is also the case in the Pixel building.",
              "This helps in reducing the waste water generation as well as save the extra water which would otherwise be used for watering plants.",
              "Often when buildings reach the end of their service lives or there are certain building violations, demolition of the buildings are carried out.",
              "This process requires fuel operated heavy equipment which generates considerable amounts of CO2.",
              "Moreover, a major part of the demolished building is not reusable and is dumped away into landfills or some other waste treatment is done.",
              "This again aggravates the problem of carbon emissions and waste production.",
              "LEED stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.",
              "It is a world famous green building rating system.",
              "Ever since the concept of green buildings was realized, a benchmark for their effectiveness was required.",
              "The LEED credit categories which is illustrated below, shows the parameters on which the building is rated.",
              "A building can score a maximum of 110 points on this rating system and the Pixel building has an outstanding score of 105 points.",
              "BREEAM stands for Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method which was launched long back by the Building Research Establishment of the UK.",

              "Just knowing there is so much oil under your feet makes profligate behaviour seem natural: people drive their gas guzzlers on journeys of a few yards and everywhere you go, super strong air-conditioning is engaged in an endless battle with 50\u00b0C temperatures.",

              "It was clear to us that the opportunity was there to create a building that would harness that wind.",
              "\u201d The obvious option in such a sun-blessed country would have been solar power, but Killa explains that his choice of wind was based on sound logic as well as instinctive enthusiasm.",

              "But even in the Middle East clients are careful not to chuck money away on mad schemes.",
              "Killa and his team had to prove the idea was going to work, which was a tough job when it had never been done before.",
              "This required a huge amount of research.",
              "The team opted for as many standard components with proven performance records as possible, to keep the client happy and the project manageable.",
              "These components included the control systems, the mounting bridges for the turbines and, crucially, the actual wind turbines, which were a type used on early wind farms. \u201cThey needed to be rated and certified,\u201d says Killa.",
              "\u201cIf we chose anything that wasn\u2019t, there would be five years of research and development, and I don\u2019t believe any client would sponsor that.",
              "\u201d This meant the building had to be designed around turbines that were intended for a different environment to an office building.",
              "\u201cWe had to take a wind turbine that was built for a field and create a near perfect environment for it,\u201d explains Killa.",
              "How would it work?",
              "If we chose any component that wasn\u2019t rated and certified, there would be five years of research and development Shaun Killa, Atkins Middle East Research showed that about 70% of the wind coming off the Gulf hit the coast head on or within a 60\u00b0 range on either side.",
              "This confirmed that the planned development would work well on the site, but only if the building were designed to straighten out any winds coming in at a slight angle, in order to hit the turbine blades head on for maximum efficiency.",
              "The solution was to create two separate wings with the wind turbines sitting on bridges between them.",
              "These two elements are shaped like aerofoils, angled so the distance between the wings is 120m at the front but just 30m at the rear.",
              "This creates a funnelling effect that, aided by the shape of the wings, straightens and channels the wind.",
              "The outer edges of the wings are also aerofoil-shaped, which creates an area of low pressure just behind the wind turbines.",
              "Killa says the design not only directs the wind, but also increases the wind speed so that up to twice as much energy can be extracted from it by the turbines.",
              "Every part of the development has been designed to maximise the effectiveness and efficiency of the turbines.",
              "The building has been carefully shaped so each of the three turbines rotates at the same speed.",
              "This means that each is generating the same amount of electricity, simplifying control and power conversion systems and ensuring maintenance schedules are the same.",
              "Because the wind speed increases towards the top of the building, it tapers to lessen the funnelling effect, keeping the wind consistent over the building height.",
              "Safety first The client didn\u2019t approve the bridges until we were up to the 9th floor, which was the latest date the decision could be made Simha Lytherao, Atkins Middle East Deciding the building shape was only the beginning.",
              "There were a huge number of questions that had to be answered.",
              "Would the turbines create airborne andstructure-borne noise?",
              "Could they deflect and hit the bridges?",
              "What would happen if the blades were struck by birds or lightning?",
              "Would the flickering caused by the turbine blades cause someone in an adjacent building to have an epileptic fit?",
              "The list goes on, covering about 200 possible scenarios.",
              "\u201cThe threshold we always set was safety and user comfort,\u201d says Simha LytheRao, Atkins\u2019 project manager.",
              "Each scenario was carefully risk-assessed to determine how much risk was acceptable.",
              "The team also looked at each part of the building and listed what events could affect it.",
              "If the risk seemed too great, measures were put in place to reduce it.",
              "For example, there was a high risk that vibrations from the turbine gearbox would be transmitted into the building structure by way of the bridges and would be audible to the occupants in the same way as someone drilling into a wall several floors away.",
              "The solution was to mount the turbines on rubber and isolate the bridges from each wing using rubber dampers, which also accommodate the differential movement between the two wings.",
              "In addition, lasers are used to monitor the turbine blades;",
              "if these get too close to the bridges, the control system shuts the turbines down.",
              "Another big challenge was coming up with the control system itself.",
              "There are existing systems for turbines, and for buildings, but nothing that links the two together.",
              "Uniting the two was important, as the control system needed to tie the turbines\u2019 output with the electrical demand of the building.",
              "Safety issues also came into play, as the turbines need to shut down if there is a fire, or if someone opens one of the doors from the building onto a turbine bridge.",
              "\u201cNobody thinks about the integration of the controls but it was the most difficult part,\u201d says LytheRao.",
              "Turbine supplier Norven worked with Atkins to develop a system that would cope with all these requirement by working with the building management system.",
              "Testing the wind Leaders in the Middle East see this as the future.",
              "Its success has contributed to a lot of the green initiatives Shaun Killa, Atkins Middle East The crunch moment came in April, when the turbines were switched on briefly to see if all these issues were successfully resolved.",
              "\u201cWe ran the turbines for 14 hours.",
              "There was no vibration or noise at all and nothing which was a concern,\u201d says LytheRao.",
              "Killa adds that the turbines produced more power than predicted, spectacularly vindicating his vision and the team\u2019s hard work (see box: How much power does it produce).",
              "The building is scheduled for completion at the end of the year and is apparently fully let.",
              "Was all the work worth it?",
              "Killa thinks so.",
              "He has also been surprised by the positive response the building has received from locals, and from other parts of the Middle East.",
              "\u201cWe were told unofficially that a lot of the leaders in the Middle East started to see this as the future,\u201d he says.",
              "\u201cThere needs to be a new consciousness.",
              "This building\u2019s success has contributed to a lot of the green initiatives in the region.",
              "\u201d The new wave of eco-enthusiasm he refers to includes zero-carbon city Madur in Abu Dhabi and the new green regulations in Dubai, plus a rash of new, low energy buildings such as the Dubai International Financial Centre Lighthouse (see box: What\u2019s next).",
              "Making the Middle East\u2019s inhabitants think more carefully about the oil beneath their feet is no mean achievement.",
              "Each of the three turbines produces 225kW when running at full capacity, totalling 675kW.",
              "This is estimated to produce a total of 1,300MWhr a year.",
              "Calculations show that the wind turbines should produce 10% to 15% of the building\u2019s energy needs, and this includes all the occupants\u2019 power use, too.",
              "But this figure is negated somewhat as the building is cooled via a district cooling system.",
              "Killa says that the calculations were very conservative.",
              "When the turbines were tested in April they produced more power than anticipated, and the calculations were based on a much higher occupant density than the actual finished design.",
              "Efforts have been made to reduce the energy the building uses.",
              "Sources from Atkins say there is some potential for natural ventilation in the winter as the balconies have opening doors, and the concrete structure means the building has high levels of thermal mass.",
              "The building is narrow-plan which means it receives high levels of natural light and LytheRao points out that district cooling is less energy intensive than a building-based system.",
              "He does concede, however, that it is not a low energy building.",
              "Unfortunately, the local power company has not yet caught up with the idea of a renewable energy network, and refuses to allow any power to be fed into its grid.",
              "Atkins had to convince the power company that power from the turbines would not migrate into the grid.",
              "This means that the power-generating potential of the turbines goes unused during evenings and weekends.",
              "\u201cIt means we cannot generate power unless the building\u2019s electrical demand is more than the turbines can produce,\u201d says LytheRao.",
              "The team are considering ways of making the most out of the output of the turbines during dead periods by installing a chiller to make ice, which could be used to cool the building during the day and reduce reliance on the district cooling system.",
              "In the long term, the team hopes that the power company might change its mind about accepting power from the wind turbines.",
              "Here, the signs are good;",
              "the power companies in Dubai and Abu Dhabi recently started accepting feed-in power, as the rulers recognised that this is the only way renewable energy can be efficiently generated.",
              "Despite the unusual nature of the building the client still wanted it delivered in double-quick time.",
              "This is not unusual in today\u2019s Middle East.",
              "In 2004, the design was at the concept stage, and normally another 12 to 18 months would be needed to complete the research and work up the detailed version.",
              "But construction started in June 2004, so the team had to complete their research and detailed design as the building was being constructed.",
              "This meant some close calls, for example, the team had not finalised the design of the bridges to support the turbines until the building was well out of the ground.",
              "\u201cThe client didn\u2019t approve the bridges until we were up to the 9th floor, which was the latest date the decision could be made,\u201d says LytheRao.",
              "He adds that the building was designed to function with or without the turbines, in case there was no time to incorporate them into the finished building.",
              "The building structure was only marginally beefed up to cope with the additional weight of the bridges and turbines, but at 70 tonnes the bridges were too heavy to lift into position by crane so this had to be done by strand-jack.",
              "Then the turbines\u2019 nacelles were installed and, finally, the blades were assembled on the ground and craned up as a unit, a tricky job because of the wind.",
              "How well the turbines will work in 10 or 20 years is open to question.",
              "At the moment, the Bahrain World Trade Centre stands with no tall buildings around it, which means it enjoys clean, uninterrupted wind.",
              "This is bound to change, as the building occupies a very desirable spot and future development may well affect wind quality.",
              "\u201cAt the moment there is nothing in front of the building, and what is currently planned won\u2019t affect it,\u201d says LytheRao.",
              "\u201cIn the medium term nothing will change, but this is the Middle East and anything can happen.",
              "\u201d Although it would be unfortunate if new development compromised the impact and efficiency of the turbines, the key achievement \u2013 the principle of integrating large-scale wind turbines into a building \u2013 will remain.",
              "The financial loss would also not be too significant, as the turbines and support bridges added just 3-4% extra to the building budget.",
              "Killa says early calculations showed the payback period was 17\u201320 years but the 10% additional rental premium the building commands reduces that to just 2.",
              "5 years, even without allowing for recent energy price hikes.",
              "The experience Atkins has gained from the Bahrain World Trade Centre is already feeding into other projects.",
              "It has designed the Dubai International Finance Centre\u2019s Lighthouse Tower, which has three big integrated wind turbines at the top of the building.",
              "Although Dubai has wind speeds about 30% lower than in Manama, at 402m the building is much taller, which offsets this.",
              "It also has 4,000 photovoltaic panels.",
              "These renewable technologies will contribute 12% of the building\u2019s energy needs, for much higher occupant densities than the Bahrain building.",
              "It also incorporates other energy-saving features such as chilled ceilings rather than power-hungry fan-coil units, regenerative double-deck lifts and low energy lighting systems. The combination of the renewable energy technologies and energy-saving design cuts total energy use by 50-55% compared with a standard good-practice building.",
