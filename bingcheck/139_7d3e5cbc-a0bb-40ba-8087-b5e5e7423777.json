              "He is best known for the invention of the crossword puzzle in 1913, when he was a resident of Cedar Grove, New Jersey.",
              "[5] Wynne created the page of puzzles for the \"Fun\" section of the Sunday edition of the New York World.",
              "For the December 21, 1913, edition, he introduced a puzzle with a diamond shape and a hollow center, with the letters F-U-N already being filled in.",
              "He called it a \"Word-Cross Puzzle.\"",
              "[6] Although Wynne's invention was based on earlier puzzle forms, such as the word diamond, he introduced a number of innovations (e.",
              "g. the use of horizontal and vertical lines to create boxes for solvers to enter letters).",
              "He subsequently pioneered the use of black squares in a symmetrical arrangement to separate words in rows and columns.",
              "With the exception of the numbering scheme, the form of Wynne's \"Word-Cross\" puzzles is that used for modern crosswords.",
              "[6] A few weeks after the first \"Word-Cross\" appeared, the name of the puzzle was changed to \"Cross-Word\" as a result of a typesetting error.",
              "[5] Wynne's puzzles have been known as \"crosswords\" ever since.",

              "The quick is sometimes thought to be simple but that isn't always the case: a clue may simply say \"draw\", but that's a word whose alternative meanings command a whole column in any thesaurus.",

              "Or often, at first, away from it: since this is a world in which fiendish is a term of approval and the work of its best protagonists is admired for a phenomenon, rare in most trades, that might be called honest deception.",

              "Combing through coverage of crossword puzzles in the 1920s, I\u2019m struck the most by how convinced its detractors were that the game wouldn\u2019t have long-term relevance.",
              "But of course, we know now that the crossword wasn\u2019t going anywhere.",
              "Currently, more than 50 million Americans complete the puzzles, and crosswords appears in every major daily newspaper.",
              "Those who similarly want to write Wordle off as a fad today would do well to heed the advice of the Chicago Department of Health of 1924, which prescribed the crossword for \u201cgeneral health and happiness.",

              "It\u2019s not uncommon for Crossword solvers to be called upon to put more than one letter in a square or play games with whitespace.",
              "One puzzle we published even had a third list of clues that offered an extra challenge.",
              "Subscribers to the Crossword have access to over 25 years worth of daily puzzles, as long as Will Shortz has been editor (he started editing the Crossword in November 1993).",
              "Our iOS and Android apps have put all these puzzles in your hand so you can play on the couch, the subway or wherever you choose to pass the time.",
              "And unlike solving on paper, the digital puzzles can check your work.",
              "Our app also connects you to the daily Wordplay column, where you can get hints and learn more about the person who created the puzzle \u2014 we call them constructors.",
              "With such a deep archive, Crossword devotees often visit puzzles months or years after they\u2019ve been published.",
              "This opens a challenge for the developers on The Times\u2019s Games Team.",
              "We have to ensure the digital versions of the puzzles work properly, even as the puzzle app itself continues to evolve.",
              "While we could manually play a collection of puzzles from the past 25 years, it would be too time consuming and would distract us from building new features.",
              "In our Android app, we run a suite of automated tests that allow us to check that the app is still working according to specification, even after changes are made.",
              "Every time we make a change to the code, our testing suite robotically plays through a set of the more clever puzzles in our archive, to confirm that any code changes didn\u2019t impact the ability to view and solve them with the app.",
              "When implementing a new gameplay-related feature or working through a bug, we\u2019ll create a test case to cover the issue.",
              "For a bug, we\u2019ll write a test that follows the steps to reproduce the problem, and then, if we\u2019ve solved the issue, it will confirm that the problem no longer exists.",
              "For a new feature, we\u2019ll build a test that engages with the feature to make sure it\u2019s working as our product designer intended it.",
              "These tests help us in two ways: they help us verify that later changes didn\u2019t break functionality, and they live on as code-level documentation for future developers working in the app.",
              "It\u2019s also really fun to watch the Crossword \u201cplay\u201d itself as the tests run.",
              "Up until recently, the Android Crossword app only supported \u201cacross\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d clue lists, which was a problem if a constructor had clues that didn\u2019t fit into those two categories.",
              "We added support for lists that went beyond the traditional clues, and built an infrastructure that made it easy to test whether users can navigate through every clue list and type the answers.",
              "Here, we see an example of our testing tools playing through a Mini puzzle by navigating the clue lists and typing the answers: The automated gameplay tests are built on Espresso, a user interface testing tool that is included as part of the Android SDK.",
              "Espresso allows you to write code that navigates the app and peeks at how the user interface appears.",
              "You can have Espresso click on buttons, type into text views or even navigate complex views like a Crossword game.",
              "To confirm that an element on the screen looks the way you expect it to, you can have Espresso make an \u201cassertion\u201d about the element.",
              "For example, consider a simple Espresso test for the gameplay screen below: we\u2019d like to build a simple test that \u201cclicks\u201d letters on the keyboard and solves the puzzle (the answer for this clue, by the way, is James BOND).",
              "We\u2019d want to tell Espresso to look at the keyboard and find a view on the screen that matches two qualifiers: a keyboard key (first qualifier) with the letter B for BOND (second qualifier).",
              "Once we\u2019ve found it, we want Espresso to click it.",
              "Here\u2019s what that would look like in code: While this is pretty straightforward, the syntax is still fairly verbose and what\u2019s going on is not immediately clear to a future developer reading the test.",
              "To make this easier, we implemented a testing robot pattern to leverage some of the language features in Kotlin that allow us to write a clearly descriptive gameplay test.",
              "The robot abstracts away the Espresso heavy lifting, and provides a way for the test to look more like plain English.",
              "To illustrate how this works, here we have a puzzle with diagonal clues.",
              "Let\u2019s walk through how we\u2019d implement a test to confirm that a solver can navigate the diagonal clues as expected.",
              "We\u2019ve assigned each of the cells in the puzzle a number from 0 through (n \u2014 1), where n is the number of cells in the whole puzzle.",
              "When we want the robot to click on a cell, we pass it the cell number.",
              "We want the robot to do the following: Here\u2019s the code to do this test, using our robot: Here\u2019s how it looks when watching the puzzle solve itself: The robot component is intended to be extremely reusable, so it reduces a lot of the effort involved in writing additional tests for the same screen or user interface flow.",
              "The descriptive nature of the test is also helpful when coming back to the code in the future.",
              "Having to debug a test failure is no fun when you don\u2019t know (or can\u2019t remember) what the test was aiming to validate.",
              "The goal of these tests is to make them emulate real user interactions as closely as possible.",
              "This includes the code that communicates with our backend to fetch puzzles, as well as the code that parses puzzles and presents them in the game board.",
              "This is because a change to the parsing code might impact how the app might render a puzzle, especially a \u201cpeculiar\u201d one like the diagonal puzzle above.",
              "We set up local instances that mirror the same server interactions that take place in the production app.",
              "Our testing framework uses a fake web server, provided by Wiremock, that responds to the app\u2019s network requests for puzzle data.",
              "We use Dagger throughout the app for configuration and dependency management, but it\u2019s also useful for switching from the live production backend to the fake web server when we\u2019re running our tests.",
              "When the app runs a test, Dagger sets up the app to communicate with the Wiremock server on localhost rather than the production backend at www.",
              "nytimes.",
              "com.",
              "This way, we have complete control over what network interactions will happen during testing.",
              "We configure how the network interactions will take place by setting up matchers for various URLs.",
              "For instance, here\u2019s the URL for puzzle 1,001 that returns the puzzle in JSON format: We want to tell Wiremock that when it receives a request for a given puzzle URL, it should return a static JSON file for that puzzle for our tests.",
              "To do this we\u2019ll build a matcher, which looks something like this: We\u2019re telling Wiremock that when it sees a GET request for that URL, we\u2019re going to respond with an HTTP status code of 200 (signifying that everything is working as it should), along with the contents of the JSON file on disk.",
              "Then we\u2019ll call this code from our tests, so that when the game requests a URL for a puzzle, it receives the puzzle JSON data from our test case.",
              "This way, the app\u2019s network and parsing muscles are flexed as well as the gameplay logic itself.",
              "The mocking layer is also handy in other parts of the development workflow, including a Test-Driven Development process.",
              "Recently, we launched Leaderboards, which allows solvers to share their Mini puzzle times with their friends.",
              "We wrote tests while building the Leaderboards screens, so that as we worked, we knew that we were meeting requirements.",
              "By using mocked data, the tests also saved us time in testing different scenarios.",
              "For example, you can\u2019t add yourself as a friend, and you can have a maximum of 25 friends.",
              "By providing mocked server responses for each of these scenarios, we can make sure the app renders the right error message in every circumstance, without having to set up a number of test users on a live server.",
              "Because it\u2019s easy to mock out the end-to-end network activity and script interactions with the UI, we\u2019ve been able to increase our UI test coverage as we add new features.",
              "It also makes it easier to add new tests to existing features, as the reusable test robot pattern reduces the effort involved.",
              "Our automated tests proved particularly helpful recently when doing a large, complicated refactor across the entire app.",
              "An overzealous find-and-replace had inadvertently impacted some of the UI resources in the gameplay screen.",
              "But our suite of tests caught the problem and made it easy to pinpoint the source.",
              "Had we not had the backing of our tests, we might not have caught this until later (or not at all), and it would\u2019ve been much harder to trace back to a root cause.",
