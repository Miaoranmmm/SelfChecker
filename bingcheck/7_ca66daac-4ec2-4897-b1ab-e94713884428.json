              "Dinosaurs might have been longer, but they were not heavier by any stretch of the imagination, notes Nicholas Pyenson, curator of fossil marine mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.",

              "But now, Pyenson and his colleagues have found that this menu of miniatures may have helped, rather than hindered, whales along their evolutionary growth spurt.",
              "By attaching sophisticated sensors to a cadre of 300 whales while they dove for food, the researchers discovered that, by and large, diet dictates the size a whale ultimately achieves.",
              "And, as they report this week in the journal Science, that constraint works both ways: The amount of stuff whales shovel down their gullets can bulk them up\u2014but it also limits just how big they can eventually get.",
              "In the study, the researchers suction-cupped their sensors onto the backs of 13 species of both baleen and toothed whales, including porpoises and dolphins of various sizes, allowing the team to track the animals\u2019 underwater activities.",
              "With data pouring in from the tag\u2019s pressure sensors, hydrophones, cameras and accelerometers, the team was able to track each animal\u2019s movements and estimate how much energy it expended per dive.",
              "Pyenson and his colleagues then reverse-engineered the whales\u2019 probable diets by surveying the surrounding waters with sonar and sifting through past records of cetacean stomach dissections.",
              "Their findings, covering some 10,000 feeding events, spilled some sizable secrets.",
              "For toothed whales like sperm whales, which use sonar to chase down and snare prey one at a time, being large can be an asset for deep dives.",
              "But as body size increases, whales get less caloric bang for their buck when hunting, meaning the ratio of calories eaten to calories burned declines.",
              "Some of the largest toothed whales, the team found, don\u2019t even eat enough during a dive to compensate for the energy they spent getting there before they must return to the surface to breathe.",
              "Ultimately, the energetic tradeoff caps toothed whales\u2019 growth somewhere around the size of sperm whales, which reach 60 feet in length and clock in around 55 tons, Pyenson says.",
              "There simply isn\u2019t enough big-bodied prey in the ocean to sustain hunters in a higher weight class.",
              "Blue whales, however, easily shatter that ceiling with a different feeding strategy.",
              "As filter-feeding whales, these animals drop their jaws to let in huge amounts of water, then strain out their pint-sized prey through the sieve-like structures in their mouths.",
              "Their maws are so massive that these whales can process a quantity of liquid equivalent to 100 to 160 percent of their own body volume in a single gulp, the team found.",
              "Compared to the thrill of the hunt, the process doesn\u2019t take a ton of energy.",
              "But when prey is abundant, one swallow can gift the whale about 10 million calories, reports Jonathan Lambert at Science News.",
              "That\u2019s a \u201chuge bang for the buck,\u201d study author Jeremy Goldbogen, a marine ecologist at Stanford University, tells Malcolm Ritter of the Associated Press.",
              "This strategy, wherein efficiency increases in lockstep with size, may help explain how filter-feeders ballooned over time.",
              "Eventually, though, some other limitation forced that trend to peter out.",
              "It may have something to do with the density of krill, which waxes and wanes with the seasons, Goldbogen tells Ritter.",
              "Another possibility is physiological: Perhaps such a massive body can\u2019t work much harder than it already does to process such a quantity of food, Terrie Williams, a marine ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz who was not involved in the study, writes in an accompanying perspective piece.",

              "The biodiversity crisis, explained The heart of the Etruscan shrew, one of the world\u2019s smallest mammals, beats incredibly fast \u2014 up to 1,500 times per minute, or 25 times per second.",
              "The human heart, in comparison, is sluggish, beating only 60 to 100 times a minute.",

              "These marine giants can be longer than two school buses, and their hearts \u2014 which are roughly the size of a loveseat and weigh over 1,000 pounds \u2014 beat as few as two times per minute.",
              "If you were to put an enormous stethoscope up to a blue whale\u2019s chest underwater, it might sound something like this.",
              "That clip was produced using real data that scientists collected a few years ago from a blue whale in Monterey Bay, California.",
              "The heart beat slowly when the animal dived, but when it came to the surface to breathe, the rate picked up dramatically, reaching as fast as 37 beats per minute.",
              "In the last few years, scientists have figured out how to listen to the heartbeats of wild whales.",
              "They\u2019re not interested in checking these animals\u2019 vitals, per se, but trying to answer one of biology\u2019s most fundamental questions: How large can an animal on Earth get?",
              "Measuring the heart rate of blue whales \u2014 which are larger than dinosaurs \u2014 reveals that body size might be constrained by heart size.",
              "And with more advanced monitoring tools, it could also help scientists protect these marine giants from one of the ocean\u2019s most mysterious threats.",
              "The short answer: food.",
              "Several million years ago, blue whales evolved to binge-eat tiny crustaceans called krill, which are super abundant in some coastal regions during part of the year.",
              "All of that food can fuel a big body, and being big allowed these animals to take larger gulps of krill and swim efficiently from one krill buffet to the next.",
              "But what\u2019s interesting is that there are actually enough krill and other aquatic critters in the ocean for the whales to be even bigger.",
              "Food, alone, does not seem to limit the potential body size of whales, said Max Czapanskiy, a doctoral researcher at Stanford who studies marine mammals.",
              "\u201cThere has to be something about their bodies that\u2019s keeping them from getting even bigger,\u201d he said.",
              "The answer, scientists suspect, may lie in the heart.",
              "Whales hold their breath as they\u2019re feeding on krill, which tend to aggregate hundreds of feet underwater.",
              "That causes carbon dioxide to build up in their blood.",
              "When these marine mammals return to the surface to breathe, their hearts beat fast to rid their bodies of CO2 and replace it with fresh oxygen, so they can dive back down and continue foraging.",
              "Larger hearts beat more slowly and take longer to replenish oxygen in the body.",
              "That means whales have to spend more time on the surface, catching their breath, which eats into precious time they have to feed on a seasonal resource like krill.",
              "Too big a heart and these behemoths might not have enough time to eat.",
              "If heart size is limiting whales in some way, these organs should, theoretically, be maxing out their speed when the animals come up for air.",
              "That\u2019s one thing that scientists wanted to figure out when they set out to measure a blue whale\u2019s heartbeat in 2018.",
              "There are plenty of ways to measure our own heart rates, from simple stethoscopes to wearables like Fitbits and Apple Watches.",
              "It\u2019s much harder to measure a whale\u2019s.",
              "These animals are covered in a thick coat of blubber and dive down several hundred feet, where the pressure is immense.",
              "Even if a heart rate monitor works under these conditions, scientists then have to find a whale, attach the device, and retrieve it.",
              "It wasn\u2019t until 2018 that scientists were able to do this successfully.",
              "In late summer, California-based researchers were out on the water in Monterey Bay studying a large group of blue whales.",
              "On an inflatable research boat, the researchers approached one of them and, using a 20-foot pole, stuck a specialized EKG sensor behind its left flipper.",
              "The whale descended, and several hours later, the device floated back up to the surface, where the researchers were able to retrieve it.",
              "The EKG sensor, which measures electrical signals, recorded the animal\u2019s heartbeat for several hours.",
              "That\u2019s where the video clip above comes from: Jessica Kendall-Bar, a marine scientist and artist who was not affiliated with the study, turned a segment of the heartbeat data into an audio file, which she shared with Vox.",
              "But this approach has some serious drawbacks, said Czapanskiy, who was a co-author of a 2019 paper based on the EKG research.",
              "\u201cThe failure rate is really high,\u201d he said, mentioning that saltwater often interferes with electrical sensors.",
              "That\u2019s why scientists have been looking for other approaches.",
              "In a paper Czapanskiy published in May, he showed that a device called an accelerometer \u2014 which measures an animal\u2019s movement \u2014 can actually detect the pulse of a heart, as well.",
              "Each time a whale\u2019s heart beats, it sends out a wave of blood that causes its body to shake ever so slightly (not unlike how a hose kicks back when you turn on the faucet).",
              "When a whale is otherwise still, accelerometers can pick up those subtle movements.",
              "Like an EKG sensor, accelerometers only work if they\u2019re strapped to a whale.",
              "But these devices offer a big benefit: Scientists have been putting them on whales for roughly 20 years to measure other things, Czapanskiy said, which means there\u2019s already plenty of potential heart rate data out there that just needs to be analyzed.",
              "Heart rate data from the blue whale shows that these animals essentially have two different heart rates.",
              "One of them is slow, like the clip you heard above;",
              "that\u2019s when the whale is diving and trying to conserve oxygen.",
              "The other is fast, when the whale is back at the surface and its heart is racing to replenish oxygen.",
              "As researchers suspected, it\u2019s there, on the surface, where big-bodied-ness could become a problem.",
              "The EKG data shows that a single beat of the blue whale\u2019s heart takes about 1.",
              "8 seconds, which means its heart can only beat roughly 33 times per minute.",
              "But as the whale was catching its breath, its heart was maxing out slightly above that number.",
              "This suggests something critical: The blue whale\u2019s heart is working at \u201cpeak performance,\u201d Czapanskiy said, and it literally can\u2019t beat any faster.",
              "But what does that have to do with the limits of body size?",
              "If the whale were any bigger, it would need a bigger heart and more food.",
              "But, again, a bigger heart would beat slower and require the animal to spend more time at the surface, giving the whale less time to forage for krill.",
              "So basically, any bigger, and these animals likely wouldn\u2019t be able to consume enough food to sustain their hulking figures.",
              "That\u2019s why Czapanskiy has a hard time imagining even a hypothetical animal evolving to be larger than a blue whale.",
              "These animals live in an environment with an enormous amount of food, yet their bodies limit how quickly they can consume it.",
              "Unless a new and massive source of nutrient-rich food appears \u2014 or an animal evolves a highly novel and efficient physiology \u2014 the blue whale may not only be the largest animal to have lived but the largest animal to live, period.",
              "That\u2019s a theory, anyway.",
              "It\u2019s worth noting that there may be a handful of other factors that limit body size, such as the distribution and seasonal abundance of krill, said Jeremy Goldbogen, an associate professor at Stanford and lead author of the 2019 EKG study.",
              "There are also open questions about the ecology of blue whales, such as how much time they spend feeding.",
              "And that\u2019s where additional research \u2014 and Czapanskiy\u2019s accelerometer data \u2014 will likely come in.",
              "Equipping whales with heart rate monitors could also benefit the animals.",
              "Just as Apple Watches detect an elevated heart rate when we\u2019re nervous or scared, sensors on whales could reveal when these animals are under duress.",
              "These devices could even help solve the enduring mystery of whale strandings, said Dave Haas, a marine scientist and co-founder of FaunaLabs, a company that develops Fitbit-like devices for whales, dolphins, and other animals.",
              "Thousands of whales get beached every year, and yet scientists don\u2019t really know why.",
              "At least in some cases, strandings appear to be linked to naval activity, leading some scientists to suspect that sonar might interfere with the navigation of some whales and dolphins.",
              "\u201cIf we\u2019re able to measure their physiology, we\u2019re going to be able to see in real time what those signals are doing to their heart rate,\u201d Haas said.",
              "With heart rate monitors, scientists may be able to determine what stresses out whales and even test potential solutions.",
              "In the best-case scenario, Haas said, a subtle change in the frequency or intensity of sound emitted by ships might prove to be less harmful to whales.",
              "Maritime groups like the Navy \u2014 which has funded research into how whales respond to sonar, Haas said \u2014 might be amenable to those adjustments.",
              "\u201cThat could have some big conservation outcomes,\u201d Haas said.",
              "In this way, eavesdropping on the heartbeats of whales completes a loop: It teaches us about how unique these animals are \u2014 how singular their anatomy is in the animal kingdom.",
              "But it may also help us preserve these marine giants \u2014 the largest animals on Earth, ever \u2014 for many years to come.",

              "Most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions.",
              "But when it comes to what we\u2019re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple reasons that we can't rely only on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.",
              "First, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy.",
              "We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.",
