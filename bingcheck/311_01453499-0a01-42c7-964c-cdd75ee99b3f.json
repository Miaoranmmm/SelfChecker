              "Both SETO and BTO have supported research, development, demonstration, and commercialization (RDD&C) efforts on BIPV via a variety of programs. The purpose of this RFI was to solicit feedback from various stakeholders, such as industry, research laboratories, academia, government agencies, regulators, and other experts, on issues related to BIPV technologies and markets.",

              "This was an almost equal split, with slightly more responses giving preference to commercial buildings and the majority pursuing both markets.",
              "It was noted by some respondents that their strategy is to initially target commercial buildings and then move to the residential market, as they see more difficulties for the residential segment due to less willingness of owners to pay and lack-of-standardization concerns for BIPV products.",
              "Some special segments of the commercial building market, like government buildings, educational facilities, hospitals, manufactured houses, and agricultural facilities were also identified by the respondents as being of interest and of their primary focus.",

              "Larger roof areas (like in warehouses) would naturally be a better fit for rooftop solar, while taller, skinnier buildings (like high-rise office or residential buildings) would be better fit for glazing or fac\u0327ade products.",
              "Overall, most of the respondents considered the extended commercial building market to be best aligned with commercialized BIPV products.",
              "This market includes high-end commercial office and retail buildings (which have fewer cost constraints and can use the technology as marketing point), educational facilities, such as schools, colleges, and universities (which consider educational and research benefits of incorporating new technologies, especially in the science and technology sectors), hospitals, hospitality buildings, and warehouse facilities (which consider weight issues and reduced need for puncture of membrane roofs).",
              "New construction commercial projects seem to have the most potential.",
              "The residential building market seems to be interested in the appeal of aesthetics of BIPV compared to tradition rooftop PV products.",
              "Development of more aesthetically pleasing products would be the best strategy for alignment with this market, though cost is also a significant factor.",

              "In terms of location, it was mentioned that the state of California would provide a large market opportunity because of the state requirements with respect to climate change and clean energy.",
              "When viewing opportunities from the BIPV product perspective, three product categories were identified as being the most promising in the market: Regarding PV glass and power generating windows, respondents explicitly mentioned the stacking benefits of glass capturing infra-red light and thus also reducing heat transferred into the building.",
              "Respondents also noted that a comprehensive market characterization and assessment is necessary, as the market opportunity will be eventually defined by the adoption and market-pull for these products, not by the theoretical availability of BIPV products that could replace a particular building element.",
              "Another view presented was the perspective of using the energy generated to offset the cost of the building element that is required by the building.",
              "Respondents approached this topic from various different angles and provided different types of information related to marketing strategies, manufacturing locations, industry composition, and PV cell technologies mostly used by BIPV products.",
              "Some respondents noted that marketing efforts are very limited and are done on a project-per-project basis, and this is considered a contributing factor to the limited uptake of BIPV technologies.",
              "In cases where developers or designers are more familiar with BIPV products, sourcing would follow the pattern of an interested architect or building developer reaching out to a BIPV product vendor.",
              "BIPV products are often marketed as elements of total-building approaches to achieve high LEED or similar scores.",
              "They are offered by the supplier to real-estate developers and architects with a promise of return on investment based on the electrical cost offset from the generated electricity as well as on applicable local incentives.",

              "In addition, a growing number of innovative BIPV ideas have emerged across smaller companies and startups in the United States.",
              "Respondents, however, have noted that currently there are insufficient economic incentives for the development of domestic manufacturing of BIPV products and their respective supply chains in the United States.",

              "S.",
              "and for businesses to procure these products could be a driver for adoption.",
              "In general, it is ideal to manufacture components as close to the market as possible as this reduces costs and speeds up development.",
              "The impact to the cost of the final product could be lowered, if the bulk of the raw materials and final assembly are completed domestically or regionally (especially if tariffs are considered).",
              "It is customary for the building industry to use local manufacturing and source materials locally, so it would be meaningful for BIPV to follow the same paradigm.",
              "Many building materials used in such products are large and heavy enough that makes sense to produce domestically and even regionally throughout the country to reduce transportation costs and logistics, which could account for 10-15% of the cost, in some cases.",
              "Other benefits include manufacturing to order, reduced inventories, on time delivery, quick deployment within the region, quality control, and the ability to better meet various sustainability requirements, while also ensuring supply chain security.",
              "It was also identified that cybersecurity of BIPV systems, as it pertains to their electronics and control hardware and software, provides another argument for domestic production.",
              "The roofing industry lends itself to domestic manufacturing, with shipping costs being a major reason.",
              "The main challenge to the development of BIPV roofing is sourcing of materials and manufacturing of the non-industry standard-size solar roof tile.",
              "There currently exists very limited domestic capability for this need.",
              "The specific glass used in PV modules is made only in Asia today and is difficult and costly to source.",
              "Manufacturing equipment and facilities do not currently exist for specific solar tile sizes, and this not only increases cost but also lengthens development time.",
              "This creates needs and opportunities for developing domestic manufacturing capabilities.",
              "Glass is also produced close to the consumption site due to high transportation costs because of the brittleness and weight of the product.",
              "Most windows are manufactured domestically, and insulated glass units (IGUs) follow this same pattern.",
              "IGUs are primarily ordered and manufactured regionally/domestically, due to custom specifications, sizes, and lead times.",
              "By extension, it is reasonable to conclude that solar windows and other glazing-based PV products are well-suited for domestic manufacturing.",
              "Solar windows are unlikely to be exported globally from a single manufacturing site as this could be cost prohibitive.",
              "If the integrated photovoltaic function does not involve fabricating semi-transparent solar cells over the entire window area, but rather only employ commercial solar cells (e.",
              "g. crystalline Si based) outside the window viewing area and thin-film coating techniques, then it is very feasible to integrate the photovoltaic window manufacturing/assembly alongside the existing window manufacturing facilities.",
              "It could also seamlessly integrate into the existing IGU supply chain (glass fabricators can apply PV coatings), which further ensures domestic manufacturing and that the revenue uplift from the value-added BIPV window product is captured domestically as well.",
              "Semitransparent OPV power generating windows also have a significant opportunity for domestic manufacturing.",
              "Respondents also identified a few additional, more specialized opportunities for domestic manufacturing, such as cadmium telluride (CdTe) as the semiconductor for PV modules, pre-engineering and assembly of unitized curtainwall panels, manufactured homes incorporating BIPV, and emerging products that rely on advanced manufacturing like quantum dots.",
              "Respondents described a variety of advantages that regional BIPV product manufacturing would provide.",
              "Such benefits pertain to: It was also noted that this topic should be more thoroughly addressed within an economic framework that will consider factors like the costs of building and operating regional manufacturing facilities, the cost and availability of raw materials at a distributed scale, projected long-term product demand per region, the ability of a smaller manufacturing facility to adapt to new products and production equipment, and how the latter stacks up against projected savings in transportation and breakage costs.",
              "Respondents pointed out that a variety of BIPV products exist on the market, but many of them are still not mature enough to be considered truly competitive, pointing out a few reasons for this assessment.",
              "Currently there exists a tradeoff between the cost of BIPV and the aesthetics of a system.",
              "The cost is a function of the difficulty in sourcing components as well as the complexity of installing the system.",
              "Installation complexity of the most aesthetically pleasing systems appears to be high.",
              "Products have not been successful so far either because of aesthetics improvements not being substantial to justify the higher cost or because of limited support services provided to the installers to sell and design these products.",
              "Products that have excellent aesthetics have often been too expensive for adoption beyond early adopters.",
              "In addition, BIPV systems do not seem to payback within an assumed 20-year lifespan of the product, based on energy generation.",
              "This is attributed to insufficient solar to electric power conversion efficiency combined with suboptimal solar orientation, and it makes the business case for BIPV weaker.",
              "It was also identified that the BIPV market is currently unstable as it is largely supported by a few specialty manufacturers who could abruptly withdraw, causing an entire market segment to collapse.",
              "Nevertheless, respondents identified specific BIPV product categories and commercial products that in their opinion are the current most competitive ones on the market: In terms of competitive PV cell technologies used in BIPV products, respondents indicated that monocrystalline Si panels (similar to those commonly used for BAPV) are the most competitive due to cost, efficiency, and reliability.",
              "Silicon products have advanced more than other thin-film products for BIPV, but BIPV provides unique opportunities for thin film.",
              "Currently, a-Si is the dominant player in the market, because it is a mature, scalable, and relatively low-cost technology.",
              "Organic PV (OPV) cell technologies were also mentioned, mainly for windows and other glass applications.",
              "Respondents also provided information on this topic in the \u201cMarketing and sourcing of current BIPV products\u201d section of this report under the \u201cState of the industry and key domestic markets\u201d category.",
              "Respondents also identified specific companies and products in the BIPV space that they consider to be the most competitive in the current market.",
              "The companies and products referenced were: Respondents overall identified that a number of factors such as performance, cost, lifetime, reliability, code compliance, supply chain integration, design process integration, aesthetics, and installation process are all important factors in the requirements for the BIPV industry and overall market.",
              "Responses were provided considering BIPV products in general and specific product categories.",
              "The following overarching requirements, spanning all BIPV product categories were identified: Identified (ideal) requirements for BIPV roofing products include: Identified requirements for glass products (windows, insulated gas units, glazing) relate to: The majority of the respondents identified standardization and code compliance as the major challenge that BIPV are facing with respect to performance requirements of building materials.",
              "More specifically, responses revolved around the following issues: Respondents indicated that the alignment between performance requirement and BIPV applications might depend on the product and the product design in a particular category as well as the specific requirements for the category.",
              "However, there are some common themes that emerged from the responses.",
              "Respondents identified a number of factors and perceptions that are weakening the value proposition for BIPV and are thus limiting the uptake and faster deployment of such technologies.",
              "These factors are grouped in the following areas and summarized below: Costs are a significant barrier, particularly in the lack of tax credits or other incentives.",
              "The resulting high cost and long payback period make it challenging to cost-justify BIPV into new or existing buildings and structures.",
              "The information received under this question was rather limited.",
              "Respondents identified a few factors that are limiting collaboration and partnerships on BIPV technologies between members of the solar and the building industries.",
              "These factors are grouped in the following areas and summarized below: The way to increase the collaboration/partnering on BIPV technology needs to educate the solar and building industries about BIPV products and then provide incentives for their use through programs or building code accommodations.",
              "Once customers understand the value of BIPV, a market will be created, and collaboration will follow.",
              "Academic research can define the benefits of BIPV to the solar and building industries.",
              "By providing local governments grants or additional funding, the early projects can be launched and highlighted to encourage future collaboration.",
              "Some work has already been performed in modeling of the production cost, installed system cost, and energy yields for BIPV technologies and systems in conjunction with partners and experts across the supply chain, including NREL, and the DOE.",
              "The most important next step to improve these models is to demonstrate and test them in real world production.",
              "This would also result in obtaining realistic field data also addressing the issue of unavailability of such data, which was identified as an important limiting factor of the current BIPV modeling.",
              "Nevertheless, it appears that in practice there are still information gaps, issues to be addressed, and improvements to be made and respondents have identified the following limitations in regard to the current modeling of the production cost, installed system cost, and energy yields for BIPV technologies and systems: Most of the current PV modeling software is designed for modeling of ground-mounted or rooftop solar systems applied to buildings.",
              "Such PV performance models do not accurately capture the unique aspects of the BIPV package and, therefore, do not give accurate information for performance or cost when used in conjunction with BIPV applications.",
              "These limitations could be overcome to some extent by adding new models within existing production modeling software, instead of developing custom production software for BIPV.",
              "However, it was also pointed out that gaps in current modeling tools for BIPV are also largely due to the fact that most BIPV tools are either standalone software or part of distribution grid simulation software.",
              "It would be more effective for BIPV models to be an integrated part of building simulation software to leverage the existing capacity and resources in building energy modeling tools and study the impact and control of BIPV together with other building energy assets.",
              "Taking it even further, more complex, physics-based models, which run thermodynamic simulations to estimate the energy consumption and capture the physics-based heat transfer relationship between heating, cooling, temperature and energy consumption and generation could be used, especially for more advanced research studies.",
              "But such models are computationally expensive and require very detailed input data, which might typically be unavailable for most buildings.",
              "Overall, it appears that there is need for both high- and low-fidelity simulation models.",
              "High-fidelity simulations, coupled with field work or experiments, could support research purposes, and should be used to validate the coarser tools developed for engineers/architects.",
              "Ideally, an integrated modeling system would be developed that spans length scales and unites PV cell/module properties up to building performance and large-scale deployments with many buildings or cities.",
              "Respondents identified several limitations that exist in current evaluations of BIPV systems compared to traditional building applications for energy performance, electricity generation, and carbon emission reduction.",
              "Such limitations are grouped in the following categories: Another key limitation with respect to data is lack of standardized data sources of city-scale building data that are needed for evaluating BIPV systems. Those data sources should include various levels of building characteristic such as basic properties (e.",
              "g. use type, year built, change history, building permits, etc.)",
              ", geometry (e.",
              "g. footprint, height, number of stories, total area, etc.)",
              ", location and climate, energy systems (e.",
              "g. HVAC, lighting, internal loads, service hot water etc.)",
              ", building envelope information (e.",
              "g. construction type, insulation for walls and roofs, window properties, etc.)",
              ", and actual energy consumption data and utility bills.",
              "Besides the data for individual buildings, several other datasets are required for BIPV system evaluation, including weather data, local building energy codes and standards, utility rates, and cost data of building technologies.",
              "Respondents have noted that very little research or development has been performed on BIPV technologies in the U.",
              "S.",
              "which could address the numerous challenges identified.",
              "Therefore, several areas for research, development, and demonstration have been identified: Respondent input was limited but overall, the following issues were identified: Regulatory compliance was one of the key barriers that respondents have identified for BIPV deployment pertaining to both the product certification as well as permitting requirements.",
              "This topic was also covered by responses to the third category about key barriers and perceptions.",
              "The following issue were identified by the respondents: BIPV technologies requiring both construction and solar technologies code compliance and, therefore, face greater barriers than solar alone.",
              "The multiple testing protocols needed for a base product and potential repeated testing for customized products add time and expense in getting the required certifications.",
              "Some of these processes may require assistance form third-party laboratories which can further increase the costs.",
              "The burden of meeting these requirements impedes innovation.",
              "In addition, solar certification standards (e.",
              "g. UL and IEC) are developed for rack-mounted conventional PV technologies making it difficult for BIPV products to comply.",
              "Similarly, the certification and testing process of building products developed for traditional passive building products and is not designed for BIPV.",
              "There is, therefore, no clear path for a BIPV company to adhere to guidelines while being innovative.",
              "BIPV deserves to be considered as an independent category with dedicated standards that trim away aspects not relevant but burdensome to the technology developers.",
              "Regarding permitting barriers, it appears that local regulations have not caught up with BIPV technologies and there are no codes or standards specifically addressing BIPV.",
              "Given BIPV products are rapidly evolving, there is a mismatch with the fire, electrical, and structural codes enforced, the newest model codes, and the newest BIPV products.",
              "NEC code requiring rapid shutdown, voltage limitations of 80V, and fire set-back requirement were mentioned as relevant examples.",
              "These challenges continue to the inspection phase of the permitting process, where the inspector enforces the code implemented at the local government.",
              "BIPV may face challenges if the inspection process and sequence is not explicitly understood by jurisdictions and builders alike.",
              "Variations and inconsistencies from multiple revisions of codes and interpretation of inspectors are also frequent.",
              "This reality results in delays and inefficiencies that influence BIPV product installation processes, timelines, and costs.",

              "These two sources of mortality are responsible for most documented juvenile and adult right whale deaths over the past 25 years.",

              "Experts anticipate cost reductions of 17%-35% by 2035 and 37%-49% by 2050, driven by bigger and more efficient turbines, lower capital and operating costs, and other advancements.",
              "The findings are described in an article in the journal Nature Energy.",

              "At the same time, there is uncertainty in these projections, illustrated by the range in expert views and by the \u201chigh cost\u201d scenario in which cost reductions are relatively modest.",

Like most renewables, solar and wind are exceedingly cheap to operate\u2014their \u201cfuel\u201d is free, and maintenance is minimal\u2014so the bulk of the expense comes from building the technology.",

              "Key challenges in wind energy science and innovation must be overcome to increase the penetration and capability of this technology.",
              "However, the success of these efforts heavily depends on how society engages with the development of wind power infrastructure.",
              "Consequently, grand challenges exist in both technical and social domains, yet little research has made substantial efforts in connecting them.",
              "Here we review the social science and humanities literature on wind energy to illustrate the social dimensions of previously identified technical challenges.",
              "We suggest that a socio-technical lens enables an interdisciplinary approach to overcome the prevalent tendency of silo thinking in wind energy research and use it to explore socio-technical grand challenges related to the design, planning, development, operational and end-of-life phases of wind energy.",
              "Finally, we provide an outlook for research, practice and innovation, including an interdisciplinary and socio-technical research agenda for wind energy science, renewable energy developments and science policy in general.",

              "Among the most well known of these grand challenges are climate change and energy security1.",
              "In the European Union\u2019s STI policy, these grand challenges have, for example, been framed as a matter of ensuring secure, clean and efficient energy and undertaking action on climate change4.",
              "We argue that tackling the grand challenge of climate change requires integration of perspectives across disciplines to address its \u2018wicked\u2019 nature5,6 that cuts across multiple entangled domains and issues.",
              "Our ability to solve the climate challenge relies on the deployment of a large quantity of renewable energy infrastructure;",
              "however, development and deployment of renewables is all too often sought in isolation by individual disciplines, frequently from the technical sciences.",
              "Furthermore, decision-makers and investors frequently use a technical go-to solution, which ends up with discipline-oriented grand challenges to enhance and accelerate renewable energy deployment.",
              "We argue that there is a need to enhance our understanding of how the deployment of renewables bears with it social dynamics (and potential contestations), which must be addressed alongside the technical challenges if we want to meet the overarching climate challenge.",
              "Here we use the case of wind power\u2014the most mature of existing renewable energy technologies, potentially providing 30\u201350% of the future electricity supply in many countries7\u2014to explore a pathway and a means to develop an interdisciplinary and essentially socio-technical perspective to approach the grand challenge of climate change.",
              "The literature on wind energy and on renewable energy transitions, generally, is predominantly split between the technical and natural sciences on the one hand and social sciences and humanities (SSH) on the other hand.",
              "Studies that combine both perspectives are rare, and both bodies of literature have tended to focus on particular phases of the wind energy life cycle of design, planning, development, operation and end of life, while rarely looking across all the stages.",
              "The technical sciences often consider social issues as separate \u2018barriers\u2019 to wind power deployment, treating these as somewhat removed from issues related to the technological design and operation of wind turbines.",
              "Solutions to overcome these barriers have often been framed within a techno-economic rationale (for example, of incentives, costs and benefits) and treating non-experts (\u2018lay people\u2019) as passive or hampering desired progress.",
              "But SSH is often guilty of overlooking how the design and operation of technologies shape public responses to renewables and of often disregarding the technical aspects of these developments.",
              "Such monodisciplinary perspectives risk ignoring how technologies are always also social, co-producing the agency of different actors.",
              "A recent series of articles8,9,10,11 has extended the grand challenges discourse into the wind energy realm.",
              "While this was initiated by engineering science, SSH and environmental sciences have since been encouraged to extend these insights by highlighting \u2018social grand challenges\u201911.",
              "This indicates a potential for cross-fertilization between perspectives.",
              "Such collaboration is sorely needed as local opposition to renewable energy deployments has been growing in the past decade12,13, which risks jeopardizing our ability to meet climate ambitions.",
              "While other SSH scholars have already advocated that technical researchers should give social issues greater attention14,15, there is great potential for influence by SSH directly participating in the grand challenges agenda.",
              "In this sense, we advocate for an interdisciplinary full life-cycle approach to wind energy.",
              "This is of utmost importance as wind energy technologies on their own do not matter much if they cannot be deployed in and with society.",
              "To support this goal, we start with a critical review of the existing literature on wind energy, where three technical grand challenges have gained prominence, and we illustrate how these are imbued with issues just as relevant for SSH.",
              "Showing what SSH can bring to our understanding of wind energy, we then propose an interdisciplinary lens that can look holistically at all phases of wind energy\u2014design, planning, development, operation and end of life\u2014and thereby better support climate change mitigation.",
              "Through this socio-technical lens, we identify a series of key research gaps\u2014or what could be coined as socio-technical grand challenges\u2014along the full life cycle.",
              "On the basis of this, we outline a future research agenda that holds promise to better tackle the grand challenge of climate change.",
              "Our aim is, therefore, to move the state of the art in wind energy science forward by illustrating the socio-technical dimensions of wind energy along its full life cycle.",
              "In the following, we use the grand challenges carved out in the technical literature as a scheme to shed light on how these challenges related to space, scale and system are not just technical or economic but are entangled with social dimensions that are ripe for interdisciplinary enquiry.",
              "In the techno-economic literature, spatial conditions are considered a grand challenge8,9,16.",
              "The energy in the wind does, indeed, depend on the geographical location, as particular conditions of the airflow are shaped by terrain, be it mountains, flat plains, vegetation or other spatial conditions.",
              "Considerable research goes into detailed prediction and characterization of wind resource conditions, examining flows at varying levels17,18,19, to find the optimal siting of wind turbines that ensures the highest possible energy production20,21.",
              "Considering the social (or \u2018human\u2019) dimension of spatial conditions for the deployment of wind farms, we find that different location and territorial challenges emerge that further constrain the siting of wind turbines.",
              "These are not per se determined by the characteristics of wind resources.",
              "Acknowledging the interrelationship between wind energy resources and socio-spatial conditions, analysis should take into account how wind energy development not only takes place in space but also has specific relations to a place and its history22,23 and may evoke particular perceptions and emotions24,25.",
              "The erection of wind turbines onshore or offshore can place new values on land and sea and render particular areas controversial26.",
              "This means that different land uses and marine interests can result in contestations, while the deployment of wind turbines has socio-spatial consequences that have often been the cause of conflicts.",
              "First, land has become an increasingly scarce resource (\u2018asset\u2019)26, co-constituted by regulatory or clandestine processes of identifying, designating or establishing suitable locations for wind turbines.",
              "Land thus increasingly constitutes a critical resource for the commodification and marketization of wind energy26,27,28,29.",
              "While regulatory processes of assigning suitable or acceptable sites can be ambiguous29,30,31, the underlying practices and implications of land acquisition for wind turbines has had a pervasive impact on local populations.",
              "Most notably, it recently has been affiliated with issues of land grabbing32,33, colonization by wind energy34,35,36, dispossession37,38 and rentiership39,40, especially in the Global South.",
              "This research strand emphatically hints at the importance of energy justice in an intensified search for wind farm sites.",
              "Second, the deployment of wind turbines has various implications for the affected areas, such as site-specific socio-economic or environmental impacts and benefits.",
              "These impacts materialize in the uneven distribution of wind energy landscapes22,23,41,42, for example, areas with good wind energy profiles often tend to occur in sparsely populated areas or wind energy developments take place in disadvantaged areas, thus spurring further de-population27, marginalization or, conversely, prosperity, while often ignoring the relationships that people have with these landscapes and places43,44,45.",
              "Scrutinizing the human dimension of wind energy deployment, there has been prolific research within social acceptance of wind energy46 that examines the manifold relationships between wind turbines as technical infrastructures, spatial conditions and people\u2019s responses.",
              "Hence, local resistance to wind farm developments (which still tends to be simplified as NIMBY (not in my backyard) behaviour by many decisionmakers and developers) has been rethought as responses to disruptions to place identity47,48, place attachment49,50 and spatial\u2013visual perceptions51.",
              "Likewise, issues of spatial justice are embedded in wind energy politics52,53,54 and in people\u2019s responses to wind farms55,56, all pointing at the importance of social values and meanings attached to physical material conditions for wind energy developments, that is, their socio-technical configuration.",
              "Another technical challenge receiving interest in the techno-economic literature is the continuous upscaling of wind turbine technology, where the industry sector seeks ever-larger turbines8,10.",
              "This continuous effort to drive down the cost of each kilowatt hour produced57,58 by increasing the energy yield per turbine59,60 has resulted in an overwhelming focus on reducing the levelized cost of energy\u2014a research focus that today seems somewhat paradoxical or outdated as onshore wind energy has become cost competitive against fossil fuels.",
              "Science here is particularly challenged by aerodynamics, structural dynamics and\u2014when offshore\u2014hydrodynamics.",
              "Making wind turbines larger has been part of the engineering ethos since the birth of the wind energy sector in the 1970s.",
              "When turbine sizes were around 250 kW in the 1980s, their contribution to the power system was considered marginal, but by the end of the 2010s, the industry could boast onshore turbines of up to 4 MW and around 8 MW for offshore61, reflecting a 30-fold increase in capacity.",
              "Today, the socio-technical imaginary of wind energy holds the potential of developing 20 MW wind turbines within a few years and the experimentation with turbine structures up to 450 m tall.",
              "The marketization of wind power has been supported by the shifting regulatory context of financial instruments61,62 (for example, national and European Union-based support schemes and funding of research and development, planning regulations), transforming wind into a commodity worthy of investment24,63,64, over time construing wind power as critical infrastructure28,61,62.",
              "Large wind turbine designs currently dominate the market, leaving little space for developing designs in a wider range of directions, for instance, towards urban wind or other small-scale designs that are more affordable for non-commercial actors.",
              "The scalability of turbine structures has, however, not gone unnoticed by societal actors such as local communities, who express an increasing anxiety about the visibility and dominance of wind turbines in landscapes and their everyday lives51,65.",
              "Opposition has often centred around the size of wind turbines and how they have outgrown the human scale, creating a fundamental mismatch between wind energy infrastructure and the scale of local landscapes.",
              "Others also raise concerns over how ever-larger wind turbines have marginalized small investors due to the increased capital cost of wind energy projects61,62,66.",
              "In Denmark, for instance, a paradigm shift has taken place in the wind energy sector61 as small-scale cooperative investors have been gradually ostracized.",
              "Small-scale investors have become increasingly unable to invest61 due to the effect of entangled processes of technological development (upscaling), shifting support and financing instruments and ownership models, further spurred on by the European Union\u2019s requirement for wind power to be subject to public tenders.",
              "Here bidders compete by building the largest wind farm at the lowest cost (in terms of subsidy from the state), which favours large utility-scale wind farm developments.",
              "Today, the roots of Denmark\u2019s wind energy sector\u2014the local cooperatives\u2014have been eradicated without facilitating public debate around it, spurring increased local opposition to wind power over the past decade61.",
              "Upscaling of wind power through marketization raises issues of distribution, recognition and procedural justice67 of the energy transition and leads to challenges in engaging societal actors to utility-scale wind power.",
              "An SSH lens can help to shed critical light on the underlying techno-economic and techno-scientific valuations of \u2018what matters\u2019 in the design of wind energy technologies, their socio-material effects and their inherent politics for the agency of different actors around wind power developments, while being reflexive of the role of situated histories of wind power developments in particular sites.",
              "Finally, the techno-economic literature is concerned with the optimal and safe integration of wind energy into the future electricity grid9,68,69.",
              "This is seen as a precondition for the further deployment and expansion of wind energy and other intermittent renewable sources, with one of the solutions being to make it \u2018smarter\u2019.",
              "The smart grid employs a digital layer on the energy system to manage an increasingly decentralized system based on fluctuating electricity production from renewable energy sources, particularly wind power.",
              "Smart grids hold the promise of a broader decarbonization of our electricity system, through optimized system integration, flexibility and demand management70.",
              "Furthermore, smart grids enable cross-sector coupling with other energy technologies and fuels, such as power-to-X technologies (that is, conversion technologies transforming renewable energy into, for example, hydrogen) and aggregation into energy islands.",
              "Proponents of the smart-grid concept expect consumers to play a key role by shifting their electricity consumption during the day, motivated by dynamic pricing in the energy market70,71.",
              "The required end-user flexibility72,73 is achieved by doing daily chores (for example, laundry, dishwashing) when \u2018the wind blows\u2019 and outside peak demand hours or by allowing energy companies to control, for example, residents\u2019 heat pumps or electric car chargers74.",
              "The social sciences are often delegated the task of investigating how consumers of wind energy can be persuaded (or nudged) to take on this role74.",
              "We argue that an approach that can move beyond the nudging of consumers through pricing would be helpful, to facilitate a better understanding of, for example, the role of visions, user images and everyday life and the design of socio-technical systems74,75,76.",
              "Visions represented in white papers, policy briefs and so on are important to explore because they actively \u2018create the future\u2019 by mobilizing and aligning actors into pursuing certain futures instead of others, such as a future with wind as critical infrastructure in the envisioned smart energy grid75,77.",
              "Moreover, the image of the consumer as a tech-savvy and economically rational agent (the Resource Man)78, which configures the consumer as a \u201cMini-Me\u201d version of his utility provider79, excludes a multiplicity of other rationalities and future users in the designs74,79.",
              "It naturalizes and reinforces certain policies and development paths over others, for instance, more techno-economic and marketable and less citizen-driven sustainable transition paths80.",
              "Such paths based on a particular configuration of smart energy may risk producing colliding valuations of \u2018what matters\u2019, such as between economic valuations and more social valuations of community concerns and energy justice63.",
              "Other SSH studies have looked at what happens when visions of the smart grid come together with users of wind energy at the household level.",
              "A recent review of the SSH literature on flexibility and demand-side management81 points to challenges related to the capacities of the users to actually change the timing and quantity of energy consumed, their sense of control and agency, and their own stake in managing the electricity grid.",
              "The taken-for-granted ease with which these systems are taken up as intended is challenged in many studies70,74,82,83,84 and may even spur family conflicts70,74,83,84, for instance, when parents spy on their children via energy management systems74.",
              "Single measures such as price incentives alone to make people \u2018play along\u2019 will not succeed in the complex reality of everyday life85 and may cause unexpected responses, for example, user hacks into the systems to improve them74,86, while also producing justice issues, for example, related to gender (as women are still often left with the majority of domestic work but might also be less inclined to use smart technologies)72,82.",
              "Further social inequalities and justice issues are related to the uneven distribution of who is able to be flexible and adjust electricity consumption (related to socio-economic status, non-flexible working hours, strict rules for use of washing machines and the like in rental or other collective housing and so on).",
              "In countries such as Denmark that rely mostly on intermittent resources such as wind power, these issues are critical and call for careful consideration of how flexible electricity markets are constructed and whose expertise should be included in their design.",
              "System integration of wind energy thus requires simultaneous changes in technology, markets, regulations and politics75.",
              "The growing role of prosumers (that is, consumers that produce electricity from their own sources87) and the European Union\u2019s recent call to give citizens a stronger role in the energy transition by forming renewable energy communities88,89 result in radically different roles and responsibilities that need to be negotiated.",
              "This needs attention as emergent business models such as aggregators and virtual power plants often rely on wind energy as the critical energy resource90,91 but also highlight inequalities in the resources available to citizens, leaving some unable to invest or participate in an energy community72,92.",
              "Such tensions between neoliberal and communitarian logics93 have become even more pertinent with rising electricity prices and the unfolding energy crisis since the beginning of 2022.",
              "Having shown above how SSH has made important contributions to the framing of notionally technical problems, we now move the research agenda forward with our proposal for a socio-technical lens on what we term the life-cycle approach.",
              "Through it, we shed light on central research questions and gaps.",
              "Founded in science and technology studies (STS)94,95,96, a socio-technical lens helps to enquire into how \u2018the social\u2019 and \u2018technologies and scientific knowledges\u2019 are co-produced97,98.",
              "Originating from studying scientists and engineers in their laboratories, the STS literature has explored how scientific facts are socio-materially produced, that is, by both human and non-human actors.",
              "From there, STS has ventured into technological innovation, the making of economies and markets, and recently also into the realm of the energy transition.",
              "More recent publications63 have moved the STS literature forward by illustrating the constructedness of renewable energy resources, renewable energy sites, landscapes and energy markets.",
              "The STS lens has become useful in shedding critical light on otherwise taken-for-granted truths, such as the assumption that renewable energies are by default \u2018sustainable\u2019 as their \u2018green\u2019 credentials are often considered part of the \u2018good economy\u2019, framed as \u2018novel, ethical and good\u201999.",
              "At the same time, an STS approach can be used to analyse how certain matters of concern come to matter in the design, planning and deployment of renewable energies and what tools, devices and forms of expertise are employed to do so.",
              "We argue that such a socio-technical lens can pry open some of the underlying valuations that come to matter in the governance of the energy transition and in the design of wind turbines and wind farms, providing insights into the often-hidden power and politics of technologies and scientific facts and even of energy epistemologies and ontologies100.",
              "Thus, this lens can shed critical light on power structures and, by doing so, demonstrate otherwise overlooked reasons for local opposition to renewables.",
              "Returning to the grand challenge of climate change, we promote a new life-cycle approach with the aim to overcome SSH\u2019s almost exclusive focus on the planning and development phases of renewables such as wind farms65,101 and the technical literature\u2019s tendency to focus on design and operation.",
              "With our socio-technical lens, the essential research gaps can be addressed by exploring socio-technical grand challenges also related to the design, planning, development, operational and end-of-life phases of wind energy.",
              "Figure 1 illustrates this interdisciplinary approach to the full life cycle, which we lay out in more detail in the following sections as we address the outstanding research issues we have identified.",
              "This diagram shows the socio-technical research gaps in the full wind power life cycle.",
              "The design stage of wind power is the phase that has received the least attention in the existing SSH literature.",
              "This is surprising given the important connection between how wind energy technology is designed and societal concerns about wind turbines and wind farms. It is often overlooked that design issues fundamentally shape future matters, with technical design challenges likely to have socio-technical implications for the subsequent stages of planning, development, operation and end-of-life phases.",
              "The main research gap here is how to meaningfully engage societal actors in the design of wind turbines.",
              "Wind technology design is by nature socio-technical, involving scripts102 or imagined users and imagined lay publics103, even if societal actors are not actually engaged.",
              "Many societal concerns about wind turbines relate directly to design, with issues such as noise104, wind turbine size, shadow flicker105 and obstruction lights106,107 being prominent.",
              "However, little research has been done on how societal actors could be actively involved in addressing these concerns through design.",
              "There are insights on how to organize public engagement in wind farm design, for example, through value-sensitive design108, but we have not seen such methods being applied to early-stage engagement of the public in design of wind turbines or to how innovation is itself influenced by political context, specific forms of expertise and priorities.",
              "Aside from the design of wind turbines, we also foresee a major research gap concerning the societal aspects of digitalization in wind energy.",
              "A proliferation of digital technologies and tools in the wind energy sector is generally seen as a promise to revolutionize how wind energy is designed, planned and managed10, but so far, there has been little research on how to involve societal actors in designing digital technologies.",
              "For example, digital twins are increasingly developed to improve the efficiency of wind turbine design and management while neglecting to engage the public in design and management decisions65.",
              "Another design-related research gap is the discussion around materials, resources used for producing wind turbines and the related justice, inequality and colonialism issues (for example, extraction of raw materials in the Global South, working conditions and so on)35.",
              "This research gap, along with those above related to the design phase, are all related to justice and equity issues in the broader energy transition.",
              "Ultimately, we argue that the challenge of public engagement in wind energy design is to turn the development of technology into a public issue, moving beyond an instrumental \u2018acceptance\u2019 perspective towards one of co-creation98,99,109 and \u2018material participation\u2019110, so that societal actors come together with wind energy experts to discuss and co-design wind energy systems of the future.",
              "It also means recognizing that energy technologies are themselves objects of engagement that may foster different forms of participation111.",
              "Although abundant SSH research exists around the planning and development of wind energy, most of this up until now has focused somewhat narrowly on procedural considerations, social acceptance and local perspectives111,112.",
              "It should also be highlighted that wind farm siting and development is driven not only by wind resources, local acceptance and planning legislation but also by engagement of non-local actors, including virtual and collective public (for example, regional networks and interest groups).",
              "An important socio-technical research gap in the planning and development phase is how to learn from increasing numbers of single case studies and findings across specific contexts113.",
              "Along with this reasoning, there is also a need to move beyond the Western-centric perspective of the Global North to shed more light on particular planning and development dynamics in contexts in the Global South112,113.",
              "Important considerations include land ownership, division of land assets, dispossession and colonization.",
              "Further, planning and development research should consider Indigenous knowledge in the Global South and the legacy of global energy history and natural resource colonialism114,115.",
              "Socio-technical analysis can help locate power structures, illuminate the impacts of technologies and expose justice-related issues of planning processes designed in the Global North and in the Global South.",
              "Here factors such as technology lock-in without cultural and societal alignment when deploying renewable energy in vulnerable communities should be considered36.",
              "Finally, another less-studied planning and development-related research gap refers to the distributional issues related to wind energy.",
              "A few studies have mapped the distribution of benefits and burdens from wind energy116,117, but the varied impacts when wind energy is co-located or interacts with other technologies is still needed, including cumulative impacts.",
              "Distributional considerations include challenging the notion of social acceptance and NIMBYism with the concepts of acceptability and active agency around technology impacts, the scope of benefits and burdens considered in wind energy planning and the impacts of tools that help plan development63.",
              "The challenge for the operational phase of wind farms is exploring how people relate to, engage with and experience the presence of wind farms in their everyday lives and landscapes so that wind farm operation and management decisions can be improved.",
              "This includes a need to incorporate a dynamic understanding of residents\u2019 concerns and opinions, which means taking into account their social and historical context and potential changes over time101.",
              "Here we argue that a socio-technical approach also can be valuable.",
              "Although it is commonly understood that people who live in the vicinity of wind turbines gradually adapt to them, this cannot be taken for granted118,119.",
              "While it is clear that community concerns about aspects such as noise pollution could be translated into practical guidelines for noise management strategies in wind farms, little research has explored what kind of tools could facilitate that and how local communities could be actively engaged in such management strategies.",
              "Enhancing this topic is the underexplored area of how digital technologies could be used to engage local communities90 and how this could help to gather more realistic (for example, real-time or prolonged) feedback from them about how they perceive the operation of wind farms. One can think here of using applications or platforms to mediate residents\u2019 involvement in wind farm management or more advanced digital technologies such as digital twins that could integrate different kinds of social and environmental models alongside technical ones to identify areas for improvement based on collectively defined objectives.",
              "The socio-technical research gaps relating to the operational phase are particularly challenging as they require exploring how different concerns about wind farm operation intersect with each other (for example, issues about noise are probably related to concerns about visual pollution104).",
              "Thus, a central outstanding research question in the operational phase is the difficulty of capturing and internalizing the dynamic character of the socio-technical aspects into wind farm operation decisions.",
              "Although limited, most research on the end-of-life of wind turbines cycles (including lifetime extension, repowering, decommissioning and recycling) has been based on techno-economic rationales, striving for an efficient use of wind turbines120.",
              "Only very limited research into the end-of-life phase has been conducted from socio-technical, socio-spatial and planning-related perspectives121,122.",
              "The most prevalent socio-technical research gap of this phase relates to how the largely unexplored interaction between different stakeholders and the temporality of wind energy infrastructures shapes the future expansion and sustainability of wind energy.",
              "During planning and development processes, wind turbines are often portrayed as temporary, easily removable infrastructures.",
              "This creates expectations and uncertainties as to what will happen once they reach the end of their operational lifetime, time-limited consents or expiring support mechanisms121.",
              "Compared with other energy infrastructure, the relatively short operational life cycle of turbines (20\u201325 years) renders wind energy landscapes dynamic, contingent and transient23.",
              "Changes in regulations and set-back distances do not always render all existing sites to be suitable for renewed wind farm projects.",
              "The temporalities of wind turbines and sites thus become debatable once issues of lifetime extensions, repowering or decommissioning are up for discussion122,123.",
              "Although this brings to life social concerns that were potentially settled (for example, conflicts, ownership structures and benefit schemes), end-of-life decisions are often managed in an opaque, fragmented manner.",
              "This raises questions about the governance arrangements for end-of-life practices and about public engagement and participation in repowering, decommissioning and restoration of sites.",
              "It also opens issues of procedural and restorative justice.",
              "Because previous research has highlighted the significance of people\u2013technology\u2013place dynamics in constituting responses to wind turbines on greenfield sites, end-of-life decisions are also likely to affect different understandings and lived experiences of ageing, fading or re-emerging wind energy landscapes.",
              "There is an evident lack of qualitative research dealing with end-of-life considerations relating to how experiences with existing infrastructures may manifest in new iterations of development.",
              "An emerging market for decommissioning or repowering of wind farms also gives rise to future research avenues, enquiring into the global value and supply chains of second-hand wind turbines, the restoration of abandoned sites and changing ownership models of repowered wind farms and how to deal with the environmental pollution of decommissioned wind turbines.",
              "These themes are important because of the wind sector\u2019s general need to perpetuate the merits of a largely undisputed conception of wind turbines as sustainable infrastructures as they are set to become a more dominant component of advanced energy transitions.",
              "Finally, we argue that the STS-based perspective can draw inspiration from a political ecological approach124, which is able to shed light on \u2018normal\u2019 structural politics of the energy transition and its local and global manifestations.",
              "Despite ontological and epistemological discrepancies between STS and political ecology, cross-fertilization between the two could demonstrate how politics \u2018with a small p\u2019 (of, for example, devices and their political effects as illustrated with an STS lens) and Politics \u2018with a capital P\u2019 may blend together125.",
              "From our description of the existing interdisciplinary research gaps in wind energy, it can be seen that they are neither purely social nor purely technical, but socio-technical.",
              "We have thus proposed progressing beyond these polarized approaches to embrace the life cycle of wind power from a socio-technical perspective.",
              "This holds the prospect of ensuring a more inclusive and co-created energy transition where there is space for synergies among a plurality of perspectives, including lay and expert knowledges, and where the sustainability of wind energy expansion can be critically examined.",
              "Critique, contestations and alternative approaches are necessary to forge a truly sustainable and just renewable energy transition67, one that can also critically examine the underlying politics of wind energy innovation, of the schemes that fund research and the types of expertise that inform these.",
              "In promoting a socio-technical lens as a means to this end, we encourage the following three actions: the development of new modes of inter- and transdisciplinary thinking and methods;",
              "revised research funding and wind power deployment support schemes;",
              "and promotion of innovative educational programmes that can grasp the socio-technical nature of wind power deployment.",
              "Regarding the first action, a more holistic and inter- and even transdisciplinary approach to the full socio-technical life cycle of a wind farm can help to include different kinds of scientific expertise and lay knowledge, contributing to solving concerns at the wind farm level and informing research on challenges of wind energy policy and planning and of the energy transition more broadly.",
              "Such an approach could, for instance, help harness the potential of emerging digital technologies (for example, digital twins, remote sensors and software applications), while also providing a critical and reflexive view as to how the use of such digital technologies in the governance of the energy transition raises justice and inequality issues.",
              "Despite the risk of inequality issues, digital technologies (also increasingly including artificial intelligence) may enable the creation of inter- and transdisciplinary spaces for new governance modes to ensure meaningful public engagement with wind power science and technology.",
              "Second, to enable inter- and transdisciplinary research to become more common, we advocate increased funding for experimentation and for compensating the work and involvement of local communities.",
              "To overcome the extractive character of many research projects and to move beyond the tendency to flatten grand challenges by reverting to traditional science, technology and innovation policy3, communities must be empowered to participate in transformative projects.",
              "Similarly, SSH researchers themselves should also be involved over the entire period of research projects, rather than being delegated a discrete work package at the end.",
              "This requires the forging of new knowledge on how to facilitate such truly inter- or transdisciplinary projects and the reconsideration of evaluation criteria for research and innovation projects.",
              "We call for more support for fundamental, theoretical and conceptual research that points to critical socio-technical grand challenges and opens up alternative ways of designing, planning and managing wind energy technologies and landscapes.",
              "Finally, to transform how wind energy science is enacted, a new generation of reflexive engineers and technically minded social and environmental scientists need to be trained.",
              "Although environmental perspectives are not the topic of this paper, a socio-technical lens would also naturally engage with environmental and ecological perspectives, which cannot be detached from the socio-technical issues outlined.",
              "What we advocate is thus ultimately a socio-environmental-technical perspective.",
              "Rethinking education in the context of the identified socio-technical research gaps highlights the necessity of exposing students to these in an integrated manner during their training.",
              "Reforming education will require generating new collaborative capacities, experiments, methodological skills and knowledge of different disciplines to allow for a more holistic understanding of complex issues, the wider context and implications of wind energy.",
              "With this outlook, we hope to challenge STI decisionmakers to re-think the response to the grand challenges discourse to move towards a more interdisciplinary research agenda that can help tackle the tendency to address complex challenges with monodisciplinary solutions.",
              "While promoting an interdisciplinary research agenda, we do not intend to downplay or ignore the continued need for targeted research to make new scientific insights to implement the energy transition in the light of the grand challenge of climate change.",
              "We also fully acknowledge there can be both institutional and disciplinary barriers to interdisciplinarity126,127, and there is often a delicate trade-off to be made between technical and social perspectives.",
              "Here we refer to the need to develop interdisciplinary methods when scaling up the deployment of renewable energy.",
              "These methods will often involve longer engagement processes, and these will need to be integrated in engineering practices through co-design and co-operation.",
              "This may well incur a cost, perhaps in terms of pace, but also in terms of equity when mutually agreeable compromises cannot be achieved and when parallel processes of innovation and assessment of the distribution of costs are necessary.",
              "These challenges deserve exploration on their own terms, but we maintain that the pressing socio-technical research gaps we have outlined are about to constitute grand challenges on their own if not dealt with in a timely fashion.",
              "They will demand that new actors join policy arenas and public debates to ensure their transformative effect.",
              "We propose that wind power constitutes a good site for such exploration of what it might mean for the realization of the energy transition as we face the grand challenge of global climate change.",
