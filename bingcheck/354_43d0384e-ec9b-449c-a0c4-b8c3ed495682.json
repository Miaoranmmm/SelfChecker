    "query": "What is the most innovative and promising approach to reducing carbon emissions from air travel, and how can it be implemented on a large scale to mitigate the environmental impact of air transportation?",
    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. That's a great question. There are several approaches to reducing carbon emissions from air travel, but none of them are easy or cheap. Here are some of the most promising ones:\n\n- Switching to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from renewable sources, such as plants or used cooking oil. SAF can cut flight emissions by around 80%, depending on how it is made[^1^] [^2^]. However, SAF is not widely available or affordable yet, and it may require engine modifications to run on pure SAF[^1^].\n- Investing in carbon offsets to compensate for the remaining emissions. Carbon offsets are financial instruments that allow an emitter to pay someone else to cut emissions by supporting clean energy projects, planting trees, or other activities[^2^]. However, carbon offsets are not a perfect solution, as they may not guarantee the actual emission reductions and they may have negative social and environmental impacts[^2^].\n- Improving flight efficiency by optimizing flight routes, reducing weight, lowering window shades, pre-ordering plant-based meals, and choosing carbon-efficient airlines and direct flights[^3^] [^4^]. These measures can save fuel and reduce emissions, but they may also increase costs and inconvenience for passengers and airlines[^3^] [^4^].\n- Developing new technologies such as electric planes, hydrogen planes, or planes that produce less contrails[^1^] [^5^]. These technologies could potentially eliminate or reduce emissions from air travel, but they are still in early stages of research and development and face many technical and economic challenges[^1^] [^5^].\n\nTo implement these approaches on a large scale, the aviation industry will need strong policy support, financial incentives, consumer demand, and international cooperation. It will also need to balance the environmental benefits with the social and economic costs of making air travel greener[^1^] [^2^] [^5^].",

              "So what is that, exactly?",
              "The idea is that any carbon emitting process, from a long-haul flight to electricity generation, can be offset by paying someone else to plant trees, preserve a forest or create renewable energy.",
              "In other words: you can take that flight to Hawaii without harming the planet.",
              "In principle, it\u2019s a great idea, and one that helps people feel less guilty about polluting activities.",
              "The market for carbon offsets is expected to reach $200 billion by 2050, according to German bank Berenberg, making it a business with massive potential.",
              "But the industry is still relatively young, and extremely complicated.",
              "Experts have cast doubts on the climate benefits of some offsetting programs, and there is no better way to protect the planet than by rapidly decarbonizing our energy systems and industries.",
              "Carbon offsetting has its roots in the landmark 1997 United Nations climate accord, the Kyoto Protocol, where industrialized nations agreed to reduce their carbon emissions.",
              "That gave rise to \u201ccompliance systems\u201d where countries and companies that have exhausted their carbon allotment can purchase credits from entities that have not used up their full allowance.",
              "\u201cThe compliance systems work because it\u2019s a legal framework and therefore companies have to work really hard to comply,\u201d said Mark Maslin, a professor of Earth System Science at University College London.",

              "\u201d But the system has its faults.",
              "One 2015 study by the Stockholm Environment Institute estimated that one mechanism devised to facilitate carbon credit trading has enabled 600 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent more to be released into the atmosphere than \u201cwould have been if countries had met their emissions targets domestically.",
              "\u201d From 'net zero' to 'mitigation,' here's how to sound smart on climate This is because several nations inflated their carbon emission targets at the outset, thereby creating large credit surpluses which they were then able to sell to allow others to keep polluting.",
              "The teething problems did little to derail the idea of carbon offsetting, however.",
              "As the climate crisis rose in the public consciousness, so too did the desire for individuals and companies not subject to compliance schemes to offset their emissions through voluntary offsets.",

              "For example, some offer credits for preserving an existing forest \u2014 not planting a new one.",
              "The models predict how much of a forest would have been cut down if it was not protected, and then calculate the carbon benefit of saving the trees.",

              "\"Essentially these contrails can alter the balance of radiation entering and leaving the Earth,\" says Stettler.",
              "But not all flights create contrails to the same extent: they form largely in humid and cold atmospheric conditions.",
              "A 2020 study modelling the Japanese airspace co-authored by Stettler found that just 2% of flights contributed to 80% of the contrail warming effect.",
              "The study showed for the first time just how few flights make more contrails, says Stettler, and indicates that relatively simple changes to altitude to these few flights could vastly reduce this climate impact.",
              "\"That's something that we think that could be done easily within the next decade.\"",
              "An ongoing trial by the EU's aviation authority, Eurocontrol and the German Aerospace Institute is already testing the feasibility of avoiding contrails using operational methods.",
              "\"I can envisage some future where in the flight planning process of deciding exactly what the route should be, it accounts for fuel consumption, as it does already today, but it also accounts for the potential to form contrails,\" says Stettler.",
              "It's worth noting that, even in a case where all kerosene is replaced with SAFs, contrails will still be a climate issue for planes.",
              "Policy measures The above measures can go some way to reducing the climate impact per flight, but industry roadmaps tend to show aviation emissions in 2030 as higher than 2019 levels even including these measures due to the expected growth in overall flights.",

              "It is hoped that the establishment of more definitive criteria for the application of green and sustainable finance to the aviation industry will allow banks and other financial institutions to develop a better understanding of what transactions can be marketed in this way and therefore enable airlines and lessors to access this source of funding.",
              "However, there are undoubted challenges to the inclusion of aviation within the EU Taxonomy.",
              "Firstly, what aviation-related economic activities have the potential to be classified as sustainable?",
              "Secondly where such aviation-related economic activities can be identified, what technical standards should those activities meet in order to be considered as sustainable?",
              "This challenge is particularly acute with respect to the potential inclusion of the leasing and by extension, financing of aircraft as sustainable economic activities, bearing in mind that the scope for technological change to reduce aviation\u2019s dependency on fossil fuels is at present limited.",
              "Although manufacturers have done much over the years to produce more fuel-efficient engines, aircraft remain powered by kerosene jet-fuel and this is likely to remain the case for some time to come \u2013 particularly for the vast majority of commercial widebody aircraft.",
              "In this context, what does \u201csustainable\u201d really mean?",
              "To inform its decision making surrounding these issues the EU Commission commissioned consultants Steer to perform a study to assess what aviation-related economic activities could be included in the EU Taxonomy and what the technical criteria for those economic activities might look like.",
              "Their report was published in February 20215.",
              "Of the environmental objectives set out in Article 9 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Steer identified climate change mitigation as being the most relevant to aviation given the scope for making substantial reductions in future aviation emissions.",
              "Steer then went on to consider how economic activities in the aviation sector could \u201cmake a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation\u201d.",
              "To do this, they examined the provisions of Article 10 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which establishes criteria within which activities may be either low carbon activities pursuant to Article 10.",
              "1 or transition activities pursuant to Article 10.",
              "2 and Article 16.",
              "Steer concluded that in view of the current state of aircraft technology, it would not be possible to classify aviation leasing as a low carbon activity although this could change in future if there is sufficient progress in reducing aviation emissions.",
              "For example, the lease of an aircraft powered by electric batteries or possibly advanced biofuels or electrofuels could constitute a low carbon activity.",
              "Based on the current state of technology, Steer advised that in order to be sustainable, aircraft leasing would need to satisfy the criteria for transition activities set out in Article 10.",
              "2 and Article 16 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.",
              "Economic activities in sectors such as aviation where low carbon alternative technology is not yet economically feasible may still be considered as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation for the purposes of the EU Taxonomy Regulation provided that the activity (a) has greenhouse gas emissions levels which correspond to the best performance in the sector (b) does not hamper the development and deployment of low carbon alternatives and (c) does not lead to a lock in of carbon intensive assets over the economic lifetime of those assets.",
              "In general, the economic activity concerned must be something which supports transition to a climate neutral economy and the phasing out of the use of fossil fuels consistent with the overall Paris Agreement goal of limiting the temperature increase to 1.",
              "5% of pre-industrial levels.",
              "The inclusion of aircraft leasing as a transition activity would therefore be dependent on an analysis of the current state of technology to determine which aircraft types might fulfil the above criteria and how their environmental impact might be measured.",
              "This task is difficult.",
              "First, it is difficult to identify and assess what constitutes leading edge technology bearing in mind that this is also likely to change over time.",
              "In addition, the rate of change from jet fuel kerosene to alternative forms of fuel is likely to occur within different aircraft types at different rates.",
              "It is much more likely for example, that smaller aircraft will be developed using electric battery technology than larger commercial aircraft.",
              "Secondly, the average lifecycle of a commercial aircraft is around 20 years although this has reduced in recent years.",
              "There is therefore a danger that supporting the purchase or lease of a more polluting aircraft now could inadvertently act as an incentive to delay a subsequent purchase of a less polluting aircraft in the future when that technology becomes available.",
              "This could lead to a danger of \u201clocking in\u201d carbon intensive assets and reduce the incentive to invest in less polluting technology.",
              "To address these issues, Steer reviewed a number of reports to determine challenging but realistic targets for the reduction of emissions based on four main aircraft types;",
              "business aircraft, regional aircraft, short to medium range aircraft and long range aircraft.",
              "They suggested that any aircraft using electric, hybridelectric and hydrogen powered fuel cells or engines should automatically be included within the taxonomy.",
              "In fact the leasing of aircraft powered by those sources should be capable of inclusion as a low carbon activity rather than a transition activity.",
              "However, for aircraft powered by conventional fuel and having regard to the current estimates for the development of low carbon alternatives, Steer concluded that only the leasing of those aircraft at the leading edge of conventional fuel emissions should be included as a transition activity and that this should only be the case until 2037 (at which point it is expected that alternative low carbon alternatives should have been developed).",
              "They also concluded that the leasing of small aircraft (of under 20 seats, including helicopters) should not be a transition activity at all bearing in mind the greater likelihood that small aircraft would be able to transition to other fuel sources at an earlier stage and their higher fuel consumption per passenger kilometre and available tonne kilometre.",
              "In order to determine the level of emissions from aircraft, Steer recommended the use of the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard metric.",
              "6 This establishes a regulatory limit for a level of acceptable aircraft CO2 emissions for new aircraft type designs and designs already in production.",
              "It has applied to new aircraft types since January 1, 2020, and will be applicable to all in-production aircraft types from January 1, 2028.",
              "Although a technically complex measure, it has the advantage of being a method of assessing emissions that is independent of the operation of the aircraft.",
              "This would therefore enable a lessor or financier to easily assess the potential for the aircraft in question to benefit from sustainable finance.",
              "For example, a lessor could check the certification or validation by EASA against the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard for the relevant aircraft type7.",
              "Steer further recommended that to identify aircraft at the leading edge of emissions reduction, the baseline for the inclusion of an aircraft type should be set at a margin below the regulatory limit imposed by the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard.",
              "In addition, Steer concluded that the margin (and therefore the level of improvement in emissions reduction as compared to the regulatory limit) should increase further over time in line with projections as to the likelihood of further technological advances.",
              "Steer believed that this would create a \u201cdownward pressure\u201d on emissions (and should cease to apply entirely when low carbon alternatives become available for the particular aircraft category in question).",
              "On August 3, 2021, the Technical Working Group of the Platform on Sustainable Finance (which is a group of experts established by the European Commission pursuant to Article 20 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation) published draft technical screening criteria (the Draft Technical Screening Criteria)8 which included aviation for the first time \u2013 including the manufacture of aircraft and the leasing of aircraft.",
              "The draft is clearly informed by the principles and methodology set out in the Steer Report.",
              "The Draft Technical Screening Criteria unsurprisingly provide that the leasing of a zero exhaust CO2 emission aircraft such as an electric or green hydrogen powered aircraft will constitute a low carbon activity within the ambit of Section 10.",
              "1 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.",
              "However, the leasing of other aircraft will only be considered a sustainable activity if it qualifies as a transition activity pursuant to Section 10.",
              "2 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.",
              "The Draft Technical Screening Criteria sets out a series of options in order for aircraft leasing to be considered sustainable.",
              "Unfortunately, it is not clear in all cases how these relate to each other.",
              "Save as outlined in paragraph (a) below, the Draft Technical Screening Criteria have generally adopted the Steer Report recommendation that the appropriate measure for determining whether the leasing of a commercial aircraft could be a transition activity is for the aircraft concerned to be certified at a margin below the regulatory limit established by the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard (a Conforming Aircraft).",
              "In fact, for aircraft other than regional aircraft, the recommended margins in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria are less stringent than those set out in the Steer Report.",
              "From 2028 onwards until 2032, narrowbody and widebody aircraft meeting the above margin below the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard would also need to be certified to run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel.",
              "From 2022 onwards The Draft Technical Screening Criteria provide that as from 2022, the leasing of aircraft using at least 5% sustainable aviation fuel (then rising by 2% per annum) would constitute a sustainable transitional activity.",
              "It is not entirely clear whether the relevant aircraft would also need to be Conforming Aircraft.",
              "We note that in its feedback the Aviation Working Group (AWG)9, a group of manufacturers, leasing companies and financial institutions, has assumed that the aircraft would not need to be a Conforming Aircraft but has sought confirmation of this.",
              "Now until 2030 The Draft Technical Screening Criteria then provide that until 2030, the leasing of a Conforming Aircraft would constitute a transitional activity provided that an aircraft which does not conform with the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard and which has at least 80% of the maximum take-off weight of the Conforming Aircraft is then decommissioned within six months of the delivery of the Conforming Aircraft (the Decommissioning Requirement).",
              "This appears to be an alternative criteria to the use of sustainable aviation fuel outlined above.",
              "From 2030 onwards From 2030 onwards, the Draft Technical Screening Criteria propose that in addition to the aircraft needing to be a Conforming Aircraft and to compliance with the Decommissioning Requirement, the Conforming Aircraft would also need to use at least 10% sustainable aviation fuel, increasing by 2% annually in order for the leasing of such aircraft to constitute a transition activity.",
              "Between 2024 and 2026 Finally the Draft Technical Screening Criteria include a provision that between 2024 and 2026 (although the exact period is yet to be finalised) the relevant aviation activity must be performed by Conforming Aircraft representing a proportion of the fleet equivalent to the proportion of [retired aircraft/delivered aircraft] averaged over the last 10 years (as evidenced by publicly available data from sources such as Cirium) (the Proportion Requirement).",
              "The AWG in its response has assumed that this criteria applies to a corporate financing rather than the leasing of individual aircraft but again this is not clear in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria.",
              "It is also unclear whether the ratio of retired to delivered aircraft is to be determined by reference to the global fleet in general (as appears to be the case in the equivalent criteria for manufacturing) as opposed to the global fleet of the airline or lessor however the explanatory notes indicate that this should be the global fleet in general.",
              "The Steer Report recommendations provide for a review of the technical screening criteria in line with then existing technological developments.",
              "As such from 2033 onwards the technical screening criteria would be subject to further revision.",
              "The Draft Technical Screening Criteria sets out a series of options in order for aircraft leasing to be considered sustainable.",
              "Unfortunately, it is not clear in all cases how these relate to each other.",

              "However, for it to be useful, more work needs to be done to create technical screening criteria which are clear and workable for the aviation industry.",
              "We set out some of the issues below: The use of the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard methodology for determining aircraft emissions is sensible as it is easy to verify.",
              "More controversial is the inclusion of a level of margin below the regulatory limit for a conventionally powered aircraft to be considered at the leading edge of emissions reduction.",
              "The limits suggested by Steer are ambitious and although the Draft Technical Screening Criteria have reduced the suggested margin for certain aircraft types, the AWG argues in its feedback that aircraft which conform to the regulatory limit should be sufficient and that no margin below this limit should be required.",
              "In its letter of February 2021 the AWG also requested that an aircraft re-fleeting exercise which would result in an overall net reduction in emissions for the airline concerned but which may not solely involve new aircraft should be considered as a potential transition activity.",
              "However, this request was always going to be controversial given concerns regarding the potential \u201clock in\u201d of carbon emitting assets bearing in mind the economic lifecycle of aircraft.",
              "The Draft Technical Screening Criteria do not include such a requirement although there is an acknowledgement in certain of the suggested criteria that leasing may still constitute a transition activity even if not all aircraft within the relevant fleet are Conforming Aircraft.",
              "Steer highlighted in their report that one disadvantage of the use of the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard metric to determine emissions is that this does not take into account whether or not sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is used.",
              "As such, they suggested that some kind of allowance could be made to reduce the value of the metric by the percentage of SAF used.",
              "This idea has been developed to some extent in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria.",
              "However, it is currently unclear in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria whether the leasing of an aircraft which would otherwise not fall within the limits established by EU Taxonomy could be deemed to constitute a transition activity as a result of the use of sustainable aviation fuel.",
              "This appears to be the case for at least one of the criteria but it would be helpful for this to be confirmed.",
              "Imposing and monitoring the required percentage use of sustainable aviation fuel could be challenging \u2013 particularly where the requirement is to show a percentage of SAF used in a particular aircraft rather than on a fleet basis.",
              "Presumably, this would need to be achieved contractually via the lease covenants.",
              "The AWG in its open letter of 22 February 2021 had argued that the use of sustainable aviation fuel was an \u201coperator choice that should not be used in any determinations that might impact lessors or financiers\u201d.",
              "From an airline perspective, the introduction of operational factors could result in greater cost in terms of administrative burden and monitoring, reporting and verification requirements.",
              "However with the EU intending to legislate to mandate the use of SAF and given the technical challenges of moving towards alternative green fuel sources, it is not surprising that a requirement to use SAF has been included in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria.",
              "Airlines operating to and from the EU may need to come to terms with requirements to report their use of SAF as part of the EU\u2019s proposed Regulation on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport (the Proposed SAF Regulation)10.",
              "It might therefore be helpful if any reporting requirements for the use of SAF were aligned to the information that airlines would be required to provide in the Proposed SAF Regulation (although the percentage use of SAF in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria is deliberately set at a level above the proposed mandated use of SAF in the Proposed SAF Regulation).",
              "In their response to the Draft Technical Screening Criteria, the AWG criticize the proposed requirement for SAF on a per aircraft basis rather than across the relevant fleet.",
              "In addition they have argued that the requirement for SAF should be benchmarked by reference to the percentage of SAF used in the preceding year by the aviation industry more generally rather than the establishment of a fixed set percentage.",
              "They argue that any such requirement needs to reflect the fact that SAF may not be readily available on commercially reasonable terms to facilitate use in the percentages envisaged by the Draft Technical Screening Criteria.",
              "The Decommissioning Requirement is also controversial.",
              "The AWG notes that in circumstances where an airline or lessor has a fleet of new fuel efficient aircraft and wishes to access sustainable finance, it could be required to acquire aircraft which are non-compliant in order to fulfil the requirement that a non-compliant aircraft is then decommissioned within six months of the delivery of the Conforming Aircraft.",
              "Steer indicated in their report that the use of the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions metric may not correctly account for the fuel performance of hybrid aircraft which may use conventional propulsion during the take-off and climb phase but then other means of propulsion (such as electric batteries) during the cruise phase of the flight.",
              "This type of aircraft is not specifically contemplated in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria save to the extent it would otherwise satisfy the criteria for a Conforming Aircraft.",
              "Overall, lack of clarity is one of the main issues with the Draft Technical Screening Criteria.",
              "It is assumed that the criteria are intended to be alternative options however this is not made clear and it is also unclear how the Proportion Requirement is intended to work in the context of aircraft leasing.",

              "Global | Publication | October 2021 The application of green and sustainable lending principles to the aviation industry has long been a source of controversy and confusion.",
              "At the heart of the matter is whether lending to an airline can ever be considered truly \u201cgreen\u201d and if not, then whether aviation could be considered a transitioning industry with lending practices supporting the move towards lower emissions.",
              "The lack of definitive criteria as to what constitutes green or sustainable financing in the context of aviation has led to the inability of airlines and lessors to access this kind of financing.",

              "In 2018, the International Council on Clean Transportation estimated that carbon dioxide emissions from aviation accounted for 2.",
              "4% of the world\u2019s global emissions from fossil fuel use and that this represented a 32% increase over the previous five year period (2019 Graver, Zhang and Rutherford)2.",
              "In addition while efforts towards reducing the environmental impact of aviation have focused primarily on measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, it has become increasingly apparent that non-carbon dioxide aviation emissions such as nitrogen oxides and non-volatile particulate matter have a negative environmental impact and that unlike carbon dioxide emissions, these may not directly correlate to the amount of fuel burned3.",
              "Green and sustainable finance products have previously been used to finance the acquisition of new aircraft.",
              "In December 2019, Singapore-based lessor Avation acquired three ATR 72-600s to be leased to Braathens Regional Airlines on the basis of financing by Deutsche Bank which was stated to be the first ever commercial aircraft financed with a green loan.",

              "However, bearing in mind the overall negative environmental impact of aviation, banks and other financial institutions are understandably cautious about potential accusations of \u201cgreen washing\u201d in the development and marketing of green and sustainable financial products for airlines and lessors.",
              "Nonetheless, as a famously capital intensive industry, there is a recognition that private finance has a significant role to play in transitioning aviation towards a more sustainable future.",
              "The EU Taxonomy Regulation was borne out of a recognition that private capital would need to be mobilised and incentivised to support transition to a low carbon economy.",
              "To encourage investor confidence that investments will have the desired positive environmental impact, the EU Taxonomy Regulation establishes a classification system for environmentally sustainable activities.",

              "The EU Commission is now considering the expansion of the economic activities included within Taxonomy Regulation to cover aviation.",
              "It is hoped that the establishment of more definitive criteria for the application of green and sustainable finance to the aviation industry will allow banks and other financial institutions to develop a better understanding of what transactions can be marketed in this way and therefore enable airlines and lessors to access this source of funding.",
              "However, there are undoubted challenges to the inclusion of aviation within the EU Taxonomy.",
              "Firstly, what aviation-related economic activities have the potential to be classified as sustainable?",
              "Secondly where such aviation-related economic activities can be identified, what technical standards should those activities meet in order to be considered as sustainable?",
              "This challenge is particularly acute with respect to the potential inclusion of the leasing and by extension, financing of aircraft as sustainable economic activities, bearing in mind that the scope for technological change to reduce aviation\u2019s dependency on fossil fuels is at present limited.",
              "Although manufacturers have done much over the years to produce more fuel-efficient engines, aircraft remain powered by kerosene jet-fuel and this is likely to remain the case for some time to come \u2013 particularly for the vast majority of commercial widebody aircraft.",
              "In this context, what does \u201csustainable\u201d really mean?",
              "To inform its decision making surrounding these issues the EU Commission commissioned consultants Steer to perform a study to assess what aviation-related economic activities could be included in the EU Taxonomy and what the technical criteria for those economic activities might look like.",
              "Their report was published in February 20215.",
              "Of the environmental objectives set out in Article 9 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Steer identified climate change mitigation as being the most relevant to aviation given the scope for making substantial reductions in future aviation emissions.",
              "Steer then went on to consider how economic activities in the aviation sector could \u201cmake a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation\u201d.",
              "To do this, they examined the provisions of Article 10 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which establishes criteria within which activities may be either low carbon activities pursuant to Article 10.",
              "1 or transition activities pursuant to Article 10.",
              "2 and Article 16.",
              "Steer concluded that in view of the current state of aircraft technology, it would not be possible to classify aviation leasing as a low carbon activity although this could change in future if there is sufficient progress in reducing aviation emissions.",
              "For example, the lease of an aircraft powered by electric batteries or possibly advanced biofuels or electrofuels could constitute a low carbon activity.",
              "Based on the current state of technology, Steer advised that in order to be sustainable, aircraft leasing would need to satisfy the criteria for transition activities set out in Article 10.",
              "2 and Article 16 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.",
              "Economic activities in sectors such as aviation where low carbon alternative technology is not yet economically feasible may still be considered as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation for the purposes of the EU Taxonomy Regulation provided that the activity (a) has greenhouse gas emissions levels which correspond to the best performance in the sector (b) does not hamper the development and deployment of low carbon alternatives and (c) does not lead to a lock in of carbon intensive assets over the economic lifetime of those assets.",
              "In general, the economic activity concerned must be something which supports transition to a climate neutral economy and the phasing out of the use of fossil fuels consistent with the overall Paris Agreement goal of limiting the temperature increase to 1.",
              "5% of pre-industrial levels.",
              "The inclusion of aircraft leasing as a transition activity would therefore be dependent on an analysis of the current state of technology to determine which aircraft types might fulfil the above criteria and how their environmental impact might be measured.",
              "This task is difficult.",
              "First, it is difficult to identify and assess what constitutes leading edge technology bearing in mind that this is also likely to change over time.",
              "In addition, the rate of change from jet fuel kerosene to alternative forms of fuel is likely to occur within different aircraft types at different rates.",
              "It is much more likely for example, that smaller aircraft will be developed using electric battery technology than larger commercial aircraft.",
              "Secondly, the average lifecycle of a commercial aircraft is around 20 years although this has reduced in recent years.",
              "There is therefore a danger that supporting the purchase or lease of a more polluting aircraft now could inadvertently act as an incentive to delay a subsequent purchase of a less polluting aircraft in the future when that technology becomes available.",
              "This could lead to a danger of \u201clocking in\u201d carbon intensive assets and reduce the incentive to invest in less polluting technology.",
              "To address these issues, Steer reviewed a number of reports to determine challenging but realistic targets for the reduction of emissions based on four main aircraft types;",
              "business aircraft, regional aircraft, short to medium range aircraft and long range aircraft.",
              "They suggested that any aircraft using electric, hybridelectric and hydrogen powered fuel cells or engines should automatically be included within the taxonomy.",
              "In fact the leasing of aircraft powered by those sources should be capable of inclusion as a low carbon activity rather than a transition activity.",
              "However, for aircraft powered by conventional fuel and having regard to the current estimates for the development of low carbon alternatives, Steer concluded that only the leasing of those aircraft at the leading edge of conventional fuel emissions should be included as a transition activity and that this should only be the case until 2037 (at which point it is expected that alternative low carbon alternatives should have been developed).",
              "They also concluded that the leasing of small aircraft (of under 20 seats, including helicopters) should not be a transition activity at all bearing in mind the greater likelihood that small aircraft would be able to transition to other fuel sources at an earlier stage and their higher fuel consumption per passenger kilometre and available tonne kilometre.",
              "In order to determine the level of emissions from aircraft, Steer recommended the use of the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard metric.",
              "6 This establishes a regulatory limit for a level of acceptable aircraft CO2 emissions for new aircraft type designs and designs already in production.",
              "It has applied to new aircraft types since January 1, 2020, and will be applicable to all in-production aircraft types from January 1, 2028.",
              "Although a technically complex measure, it has the advantage of being a method of assessing emissions that is independent of the operation of the aircraft.",
              "This would therefore enable a lessor or financier to easily assess the potential for the aircraft in question to benefit from sustainable finance.",
              "For example, a lessor could check the certification or validation by EASA against the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard for the relevant aircraft type7.",
              "Steer further recommended that to identify aircraft at the leading edge of emissions reduction, the baseline for the inclusion of an aircraft type should be set at a margin below the regulatory limit imposed by the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard.",
              "In addition, Steer concluded that the margin (and therefore the level of improvement in emissions reduction as compared to the regulatory limit) should increase further over time in line with projections as to the likelihood of further technological advances.",
              "Steer believed that this would create a \u201cdownward pressure\u201d on emissions (and should cease to apply entirely when low carbon alternatives become available for the particular aircraft category in question).",
              "On August 3, 2021, the Technical Working Group of the Platform on Sustainable Finance (which is a group of experts established by the European Commission pursuant to Article 20 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation) published draft technical screening criteria (the Draft Technical Screening Criteria)8 which included aviation for the first time \u2013 including the manufacture of aircraft and the leasing of aircraft.",
              "The draft is clearly informed by the principles and methodology set out in the Steer Report.",
              "The Draft Technical Screening Criteria unsurprisingly provide that the leasing of a zero exhaust CO2 emission aircraft such as an electric or green hydrogen powered aircraft will constitute a low carbon activity within the ambit of Section 10.",
              "1 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.",
              "However, the leasing of other aircraft will only be considered a sustainable activity if it qualifies as a transition activity pursuant to Section 10.",
              "2 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.",
              "The Draft Technical Screening Criteria sets out a series of options in order for aircraft leasing to be considered sustainable.",
              "Unfortunately, it is not clear in all cases how these relate to each other.",
              "Save as outlined in paragraph (a) below, the Draft Technical Screening Criteria have generally adopted the Steer Report recommendation that the appropriate measure for determining whether the leasing of a commercial aircraft could be a transition activity is for the aircraft concerned to be certified at a margin below the regulatory limit established by the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard (a Conforming Aircraft).",
              "In fact, for aircraft other than regional aircraft, the recommended margins in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria are less stringent than those set out in the Steer Report.",
              "From 2028 onwards until 2032, narrowbody and widebody aircraft meeting the above margin below the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard would also need to be certified to run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel.",
              "From 2022 onwards The Draft Technical Screening Criteria provide that as from 2022, the leasing of aircraft using at least 5% sustainable aviation fuel (then rising by 2% per annum) would constitute a sustainable transitional activity.",
              "It is not entirely clear whether the relevant aircraft would also need to be Conforming Aircraft.",
              "We note that in its feedback the Aviation Working Group (AWG)9, a group of manufacturers, leasing companies and financial institutions, has assumed that the aircraft would not need to be a Conforming Aircraft but has sought confirmation of this.",
              "Now until 2030 The Draft Technical Screening Criteria then provide that until 2030, the leasing of a Conforming Aircraft would constitute a transitional activity provided that an aircraft which does not conform with the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard and which has at least 80% of the maximum take-off weight of the Conforming Aircraft is then decommissioned within six months of the delivery of the Conforming Aircraft (the Decommissioning Requirement).",
              "This appears to be an alternative criteria to the use of sustainable aviation fuel outlined above.",
              "From 2030 onwards From 2030 onwards, the Draft Technical Screening Criteria propose that in addition to the aircraft needing to be a Conforming Aircraft and to compliance with the Decommissioning Requirement, the Conforming Aircraft would also need to use at least 10% sustainable aviation fuel, increasing by 2% annually in order for the leasing of such aircraft to constitute a transition activity.",
              "Between 2024 and 2026 Finally the Draft Technical Screening Criteria include a provision that between 2024 and 2026 (although the exact period is yet to be finalised) the relevant aviation activity must be performed by Conforming Aircraft representing a proportion of the fleet equivalent to the proportion of [retired aircraft/delivered aircraft] averaged over the last 10 years (as evidenced by publicly available data from sources such as Cirium) (the Proportion Requirement).",
              "The AWG in its response has assumed that this criteria applies to a corporate financing rather than the leasing of individual aircraft but again this is not clear in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria.",
              "It is also unclear whether the ratio of retired to delivered aircraft is to be determined by reference to the global fleet in general (as appears to be the case in the equivalent criteria for manufacturing) as opposed to the global fleet of the airline or lessor however the explanatory notes indicate that this should be the global fleet in general.",
              "The Steer Report recommendations provide for a review of the technical screening criteria in line with then existing technological developments.",
              "As such from 2033 onwards the technical screening criteria would be subject to further revision.",
              "The Draft Technical Screening Criteria sets out a series of options in order for aircraft leasing to be considered sustainable.",

              "However, for it to be useful, more work needs to be done to create technical screening criteria which are clear and workable for the aviation industry.",
              "We set out some of the issues below: The use of the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard methodology for determining aircraft emissions is sensible as it is easy to verify.",
              "More controversial is the inclusion of a level of margin below the regulatory limit for a conventionally powered aircraft to be considered at the leading edge of emissions reduction.",
              "The limits suggested by Steer are ambitious and although the Draft Technical Screening Criteria have reduced the suggested margin for certain aircraft types, the AWG argues in its feedback that aircraft which conform to the regulatory limit should be sufficient and that no margin below this limit should be required.",
              "In its letter of February 2021 the AWG also requested that an aircraft re-fleeting exercise which would result in an overall net reduction in emissions for the airline concerned but which may not solely involve new aircraft should be considered as a potential transition activity.",
              "However, this request was always going to be controversial given concerns regarding the potential \u201clock in\u201d of carbon emitting assets bearing in mind the economic lifecycle of aircraft.",
              "The Draft Technical Screening Criteria do not include such a requirement although there is an acknowledgement in certain of the suggested criteria that leasing may still constitute a transition activity even if not all aircraft within the relevant fleet are Conforming Aircraft.",
              "Steer highlighted in their report that one disadvantage of the use of the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions standard metric to determine emissions is that this does not take into account whether or not sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is used.",
              "As such, they suggested that some kind of allowance could be made to reduce the value of the metric by the percentage of SAF used.",
              "This idea has been developed to some extent in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria.",
              "However, it is currently unclear in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria whether the leasing of an aircraft which would otherwise not fall within the limits established by EU Taxonomy could be deemed to constitute a transition activity as a result of the use of sustainable aviation fuel.",
              "This appears to be the case for at least one of the criteria but it would be helpful for this to be confirmed.",
              "Imposing and monitoring the required percentage use of sustainable aviation fuel could be challenging \u2013 particularly where the requirement is to show a percentage of SAF used in a particular aircraft rather than on a fleet basis.",
              "Presumably, this would need to be achieved contractually via the lease covenants.",
              "The AWG in its open letter of 22 February 2021 had argued that the use of sustainable aviation fuel was an \u201coperator choice that should not be used in any determinations that might impact lessors or financiers\u201d.",
              "From an airline perspective, the introduction of operational factors could result in greater cost in terms of administrative burden and monitoring, reporting and verification requirements.",
              "However with the EU intending to legislate to mandate the use of SAF and given the technical challenges of moving towards alternative green fuel sources, it is not surprising that a requirement to use SAF has been included in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria.",
              "Airlines operating to and from the EU may need to come to terms with requirements to report their use of SAF as part of the EU\u2019s proposed Regulation on ensuring a level playing field for sustainable air transport (the Proposed SAF Regulation)10.",
              "It might therefore be helpful if any reporting requirements for the use of SAF were aligned to the information that airlines would be required to provide in the Proposed SAF Regulation (although the percentage use of SAF in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria is deliberately set at a level above the proposed mandated use of SAF in the Proposed SAF Regulation).",
              "In their response to the Draft Technical Screening Criteria, the AWG criticize the proposed requirement for SAF on a per aircraft basis rather than across the relevant fleet.",
              "In addition they have argued that the requirement for SAF should be benchmarked by reference to the percentage of SAF used in the preceding year by the aviation industry more generally rather than the establishment of a fixed set percentage.",
              "They argue that any such requirement needs to reflect the fact that SAF may not be readily available on commercially reasonable terms to facilitate use in the percentages envisaged by the Draft Technical Screening Criteria.",
              "The Decommissioning Requirement is also controversial.",
              "The AWG notes that in circumstances where an airline or lessor has a fleet of new fuel efficient aircraft and wishes to access sustainable finance, it could be required to acquire aircraft which are non-compliant in order to fulfil the requirement that a non-compliant aircraft is then decommissioned within six months of the delivery of the Conforming Aircraft.",
              "Steer indicated in their report that the use of the ICAO aeroplane CO2 emissions metric may not correctly account for the fuel performance of hybrid aircraft which may use conventional propulsion during the take-off and climb phase but then other means of propulsion (such as electric batteries) during the cruise phase of the flight.",
              "This type of aircraft is not specifically contemplated in the Draft Technical Screening Criteria save to the extent it would otherwise satisfy the criteria for a Conforming Aircraft.",
              "Overall, lack of clarity is one of the main issues with the Draft Technical Screening Criteria.",
              "It is assumed that the criteria are intended to be alternative options however this is not made clear and it is also unclear how the Proportion Requirement is intended to work in the context of aircraft leasing.",
              "The EU Taxonomy Regulation provides that the technical screening criteria should be \u201ceasy to use and be set in a manner that facilitates the verification of their compliance\u201d.",
