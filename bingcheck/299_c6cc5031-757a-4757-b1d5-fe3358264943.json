    "query": "What are the most significant cultural similarities and differences between traditional Japanese and Korean cuisine, and how have these culinary traditions evolved over time to reflect regional and global influences?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. Traditional Japanese and Korean cuisine have some similarities and differences that reflect their cultural and historical backgrounds. Here are some of the main points:\n\n- Both cuisines use rice and noodles as staple foods, but they have different types of rice and noodles. For example, Japanese rice is usually short-grained and sticky, while Korean rice is medium-grained and fluffy. Japanese noodles include soba, udon, ramen, and somen, while Korean noodles include naengmyeon, japchae, jjajangmyeon, and kalguksu[^2^] [^3^].\n- Both cuisines also use fermented foods, such as soy sauce, miso, natto, and umeboshi in Japan, and kimchi, doenjang, gochujang, and jeotgal in Korea. Fermented foods are rich in probiotics and enzymes that aid digestion and boost immunity. However, the fermentation process and ingredients vary between the two countries. For example, kimchi is made with napa cabbage, radish, garlic, ginger, scallions, and red pepper flakes, while natto is made with soybeans and a type of bacteria called Bacillus subtilis[^1^] [^6^].\n- Both cuisines also have a variety of seafood dishes, as they are surrounded by the sea. However, Japanese cuisine tends to be more delicate and refined, while Korean cuisine is bolder and more robust. Japanese seafood dishes include sushi, sashimi, tempura, and grilled fish, while Korean seafood dishes include hoe (raw fish), jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup), haemul pajeon (seafood pancake), and grilled shellfish[^2^] [^5^].\n- One of the main differences between Japanese and Korean cuisine is the use of spices. While Korean food uses a lot of spices, especially red pepper flakes and garlic, Japanese food keeps things more natural with just a minimum of added flavors. Especially hot and spicy dishes are found in Korean cuisine, such as tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), dakgalbi (spicy chicken stir-fry), and sundubu jjigae (spicy soft tofu stew), but not in Japanese cuisine[^2^] [^6^].\n- Another difference is the number and variety of side dishes. Korean cuisine usually serves many side dishes called banchan along with the main course. These side dishes include kimchi, namul (seasoned vegetables), jeon (pan-fried dishes), jorim (braised dishes), jjigae (stews), etc. Japanese cuisine usually serves fewer side dishes than Koreans. These side dishes include tsukemono (pickles), nimono (simmered dishes), sunomono (vinegared dishes), etc[^2^] [^6^].\n- Both cuisines have been influenced by other cultures over time. Japanese cuisine was influenced by Chinese cuisine in ancient times, especially in terms of noodles, dumplings, and tea. It was also influenced by Western cuisine in modern times, especially after the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Some examples of Japanese-Western fusion dishes are kare raisu (curry rice), tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlet), omuraisu (omelet rice), etc[^7^] [^8^]. Korean cuisine was influenced by Chinese cuisine as well, especially in terms of noodles, dumplings, and stir-fries. It was also influenced by Japanese cuisine during the colonial period from 1910 to 1945. Some examples of Korean-Japanese fusion dishes are kimbap (rice rolls), ramyeon (instant noodles), chikin (fried chicken), etc[^1^] [^9^].\n\nI hope this answer gives you some insight into the similarities and differences between traditional Japanese and Korean cuisine.

              "Chromosome 11 contained the highest number of variants (202,697), and chromosome 5 the lowest number of variants (20,602).",
              "A similar result has been reported by resequencing a Japanese temperate japonica rice variety, Koshihikari [2].",
              "In comparison between Koshihikari and Nipponbare, which is the reference genome, chromosome 11 showed the highest number of SNPs (12,216), and chromosome 5 the second lowest number of SNPs (1032).",
              "Moreover, in resequencing 10 Japanese temperate japonica rice varieties released in Hokkaido, chromosome 11 contained the highest number of SNPs (10,870\u201318,779), and chromosome 5 the lowest number of SNPs (1563\u20132834) in comparison with Nipponbare [6].",
              "In the study by Arai-Kichise et al.",
              "[5], six Japanese temperate japonica rice varieties were resequenced, and chromosome 11 contained the second highest number of SNPs (12,215\u201327,182), while chromosome 5 had the lowest number of SNPs (1184\u20136119) in comparison with Nipponbare [5].",
              "Such a large difference seems to be seen only in temperate japonica rice varieties.",
              "The Moroberekan, a tropical japonica rice variety, did not show a large difference in SNP numbers: 61,350 on chromosome 5 and 61,169 on chromosome 11 [5].",
              "The differences in the numbers of SNPs between chromosome 5 and chromosome 11 were much smaller in two Korean Tongil-type indica varieties: 72,242 and 87,759 on chromosome 5 vs. 121,783 and 126,752 on chromosome 11 [59].",
              "The cause of the large differences in the numbers of sequence variations among chromosomes in temperate japonica rice varieties is unclear and needs further research.",
              "Overall, the genomic variation found in this study will facilitate the development of markers for mapping important genes and for marker-assisted selection, together with the development of a high-throughput genome-wide genotyping system for Korean japonica rice varieties.",
              "Through analyzing genome resequencing data from 24 Korean temperate japonica rice varieties, we discovered 954,233 sequence variations, including 791,121 SNPs and 163,112 InDels.",
              "The effect of each variant on gene function was predicted using the SnpEff program and was included in annotation.",
              "Eight InDels from a pre-harvest sprouting resistance QTL (qPHS11) target region, four highly polymorphic InDels, and four functional sequence variations in well-known agronomically important genes were selected and successfully developed into markers.",

              "or fish-based stock, although vegetarian versions are available too.",
              "The most important thing to know about ramen is that it is not an egg noodle nor a rice noodle\u2014 just wheat flour, salt, water, and kansui, or lye water.",
              "The ramen broth is flavored with additions like soy sauce or miso along with edible kelp called kombu or dried seaweed called nori.",
              "Ingredients like katsuobushi or bonito flakes add fishiness while shiitake mushrooms add earthy, umami flavors.",

              "Each region of Japan has its own version of the ramen noodle, highlighting regional and/or seasonal flavors, like Kyushu's tonkotsu, or pork bone broth ramen, and Hokkaido's miso ramen.",
              "And there are even different styles of ramen wheat noodles depending on the characteristics of the broth.",
              "Thick noodles pair better with a miso broth than a shoyu or soy sauce broth, which pairs well with thin noodles.",

              "Sometimes, fried tofu and/or tempura are also added.",
              "Just like ramen, the flavor profiles of udon soup broths vary region-to-region across Japan.",
              "Although, one notable trend is that broths are typically darker in eastern Japan thanks to the use of dark soy sauce, also called koikuchi sho\u0304yu.",
              "\ufeff\ufeff\ufeffIn contrast, broths tend to be lighter, due to the use of light soy sauce or usukuchi sho\u0304yu, in western Japan.",

              "Of course, there\u2019s no need to have only one.",
              "With all the hot and cold varieties of each of these types of Japanese noodles, there are endless possibilities for your next snack or meal.",
              "There are a few main differences between these delicious noodles, including the ingredients they are made of, their thickness, and their appearance.",
              "Udon noodles use saltwater and flour to create a pure white noodle that is thicker and has more chewiness than soba.",
              "Soba noodles are created using a combination of water, wheat, and buckwheat flour, and they're much thinner in comparison.",
              "You can recognize this type of noodle's light brown hue in soups and other soba recipes.",
              "A final difference between these varieties of noodles is the flavor.",
              "Udon noodles offer a subtle taste, while soba noodles present a more robust earthy flavor and nuttiness.",
              "Combine wheat flour, salt, and water in a bowl to make Udon noodles.",
              "After the dough has come together, it is kneaded, rolled out, left to rest, and then cut into thick 1/4\" noodles.",
              "The final step is boiling the noodles before adding them to soup or dipping them in dashi.",
              "Soba noodles are made similarly, though the dough takes longer to form due to a lack of gluten in buckwheat.",
              "Using the minimum amount of wheat possible when combining the ingredients is essential, though it is necessary to have some form of gluten for easier dough rolling.",
              "After adding the ingredients into a large bowl, kneading occurs until the dough forms. Next, either Edo-style or country-style rolling happens.",
              "Edo-style uses three rolling pins and is incorporated when there is a lack of kitchen space.",
              "Afterward, the dough is rolled out thinly, cut, and stored (or dried, then stored) until use.",
              "Now that you\u2019re hungry, here are some ways to enjoy Udon noodles.",
              "They range from hot to cold dishes and are incredibly tasty.",
              "Simple but delicious.",
              "Noodles are added to a bowl and topped with tsuyu, a mild broth in this version.",

              "With the rise of K-pop and Korean dramas, dreamy-looking Korean celebrities have become cultural ambassadors, making us curious about all things Korea, and along with that, Korean food.",
              "When it comes to Korean food, our minds will usually jump to Korean barbecue.",
              "Those succulent, savoury and sweet meats can induce drooling even in the most devout vegetarians.",

              "Without further ado, let\u2019s get started!",
              "Jajangmyeon My personal favourite, and arguably the least pretty of all the famous Korean noodles.",
              "It has its origins in a Chinese noodle dish, zhajiangmian (literally \u201cfried sauce noodles\u201d), but has since become fully Koreanized, perfectly embodying the flavours that Koreans know and love.",
              "You can find it in most Korean restaurants, and it will almost always be served the same way, kind of like this: The noodles Jajangmyeon uses wheat-based noodles that should be thick and cooked al dente, so that the noodles have a firm bite and do not easily fall apart.",
              "They should be thick and solid enough to hold the delicious heavy sauce that drowns them.",
              "Speaking of sauce.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "The sauce It ain\u2019t pretty to look at, but trust me when I say that jajangmyeon sauce is one of the tastiest noodle sauces in existence.",
              "A rich, dark, thick gravy, it consists primarily of chunjang (a Korean sweet sauce made of soybeans), soy sauce and/or oyster sauce, and usually also contains diced potato, minced meat (pork or beef), onions, and sometimes garlic, ginger, and scallions, and is slathered on thick all over the noodles.",
              "You\u2019ll have to mix jajangmyeon thoroughly before eating it to work every bit of this mouthwatering sauce onto every inch of noodle, so that you can experience how this dish was meant to taste.",
              "In addition, some restaurants may top your jajangmyeon with freshly julienned cucumbers, meant to cleanse your palate and balance out the heaviness of the rich sauce.",
              "Japchae Japchae is a colourful Korean noodle dish that was once considered a royal dish.",
              "Surprisingly, the original version didn\u2019t contain any noodles!",
              "Someone quickly realized that was a crazy idea, and over the years the dish has evolved into its current, noodle-y version that people know and love.",
              "It is usually served at banquets and birthday parties, and is basically just your all around, everybody-loves-it Korean noodle dish.",
              "The noodles The noodles used to make japchae are called dangmyeon, translucent glass noodles (cellophane noodles) made of sweet potato starch.",
              "When prepared, they should be elastic and slightly chewy.",
              "The great thing about japchae noodles is their ability to soak up the flavours of the sauce and other ingredients mixed into japchae, so you never have to worry about these noodles lacking flavour.",
              "The sauce Japchae isn\u2019t a particularly saucy noodle dish, as most of the sauce is soaked up by the noodles, giving them a golden-brown colour.",
              "The main ingredients in japchae sauce are soy sauce, sugar, and a decent portion of sesame oil, which results in japchae\u2019s sesame-like taste.",
              "The noodles are also tossed with a colourful array of cooked, sliced vegetables, most commonly carrots, onions, spinach, and mushrooms, depending on the chef\u2019s personal touch.",
              "A kind of marinated meat can be added, usually beef or pork bulgogi, and the finished dish is topped with sesame seeds and thin strips of chilis, and sometimes also an egg omelette cut into ribbons.",
              "Japchae noodles go great with your Korean barbecue!",
              "Naengmyeon Naengmyeon holds a special place in my heart, as I first tried it on a scorching hot summer\u2019s day in Korea, and I felt refreshed from the first bite of noodle to the last slurp of soup.",
              "The name naengmyeon literally means \u201ccold noodles\u201d, and as such they are a popular summertime dish.",
              "I know what you\u2019re thinking: cold noodles?",
              "You\u2019re out of your mind!",
              "To which I\u2019ll respond with the old adage \u201cYou can\u2019t knock it till you\u2019ve tried it.",
              "\u201d Originally popular in North Korea, its popularity spread to all corners of the Korean peninsula after the Korean War.",
              "The noodles Naengmyeon noodles are unique among Korean noodles as they are very, very chewy.",
              "They are made mostly of buckwheat, but also contain various other starches from potato and arrowroot, lending to their extra chewiness.",
              "Their length symbolizes longevity and are traditionally eaten without being cut (as to not cut your \u201clife\u201d short), but since a lot of people find them difficult to eat whole because of their chewiness and length, servers will usually cut them with scissors once they place them in front of you.",
              "Personally, I like eating them as they are.",
              "The soup Traditional naengmyeon, called mul naengmyeon, sits in a stainless steel bowl (to maintain their cool temperature), bathed in a chilled, light broth.",
              "The broth has some flavour, but extra sauces like spicy mustard or vinegar are provided for you to add as you like.",
              "The noodles are also topped with julienned cucumbers, beef slices, pear slices, and half a boiled egg.",
              "There is another popular version of naengmyeon, called bibim naengmyeon, which instead of containing broth is covered in a spicy chili sauce and the ingredients are mixed and eaten together.",
              "Shin Ramyun This one is sort of a bonus one, but seriously, I can\u2019t talk about Korean noodles without mentioning Shin Ramyun!",
              "It is by far the most popular brand of instant noodles in South Korea, and is probably consumed more often than the other noodles I just mentioned.",
              "You can even find them as an ingredient in restaurant or pub fare, they are that ubiquitous.",
              "Plus, they just taste pretty damn good.",
              "The noodles Open a pack of Shin Ramyun and your eyes will instantly be drawn to the deep yellowness of the dried noodle puck.",
              "What sets Shin Ramyun apart from other instant noodles is, in my opinion, their chewiness.",
              "Where other instant noodles will get soggy quickly in the broth or when you overcook them slightly, Shin Ramyun is able to keep its consistency for much longer, lending to that trademark chewy bite that many Koreans (and basically anyone who has tried it) know and love.",
              "The soup Its trademark spicy soup definitely makes Shin Ramyun stand out from the pack.",
              "It is savoury and has a kick, but is not overly spicy.",
              "There are also dried pieces of beef and the classic dried vegetable sachet which can add to the nutrition value (haha) of the noodles.",
              "They have become such a cultural icon that many people like to make their own versions of noodle dishes utilizing the Shin Ramyun noodles, adding their own ingredients and creating nice little college dinner masterpieces.",
              "There you have it!",
              "Your Korean noodle starter pack.",

              "Once fully fermented, natto will have a pungent smell and a distinct flavor.",
              "It also has a white biofilm from fermentation, which makes natto slimy and can create a stringy texture.",
              "The uniqueness of natto usually divides people into two groups \u2013 those who absolutely love it and those who can\u2019t stand it.",
              "Regardless of the preference, natto is undoubtedly full of nutrients like vitamins K2 and B6, minerals like manganese, calcium, and iron, and is pretty high in calories too.",
              "People usually eat natto as a snack or as a part of their breakfast, though there are no limitations about when and how you consume it.",
              "As a fermented food, natto is also full of probiotics, which promotes a healthier digestive system.",

              "There\u2019s no need to add any starter, and the fermentation takes more time, usually around six months.",

              "\u201d The brine is added to the blocks and left in a dark place to ferment slowly.",
              "Some traditional doenjang manufacturers add chili powder to the mix two to three months into the fermentation process, but that\u2019s not a requirement.",
              "So, I\u2019ve defined traditional doenjang.",
              "However, the doenjang you find in Asian markets or well-stocked supermarkets today is not quite the same paste.",
              "Modern factory production of doenjang requires a starter to ensure much faster fermentation.",
              "After all, more prominent brands want to put doenjang on the shelves as soon as possible.",
              "For that reason, they add the koji starter, a mold culture composed of Aspergillus oryzae spores, a fungus widely used in the food industry.",
              "Faster fermentation of doenjang produces more sugar;",
              "therefore, the final product will be sweeter and smoother.",
              "When shopping for doenjang, check the label for ingredients to determine whether you\u2019re buying traditionally prepared or mass-produced ingredients.",
              "Because doenjang is a paste, it\u2019s typically packaged in glass jars or airtight plastic containers.",
              "As a result, you only need a little doenjang to flavor a dish and ensure that the umami flavor pops.",
              "The most popular dish made with doenjang is doenjang jjigae, an aromatic soybean soup.",
              "But you can add doenjang to many savory dishes, like stews and stir-fry recipes, or add it to salad dressings.",
              "At first glance, natto and doenjang don\u2019t really have that much in common.",
              "One is a Japanese dish, and the other is a Korean paste.",

              "As fermented foods, they promote better function of the digestive system.",
              "While doenjang is slightly richer in calories, you can place them in the same range.",
              "One tablespoon of doenjang paste has around 35 calories, and the same portion of natto is close to 30.",
              "Undoubtedly, natto and doenjang have more differences than similarities.",
              "However, when we get past the fact that they\u2019re both East Asian fermented foods, we immediately notice the difference in color and texture.",
              "Doenjang is a paste.",
              "As such, it has specific applications in other dishes, can be used to make soups, salad dressings, and stews, and is an excellent addition to fish, meat, and tofu meals.",
              "In addition, traditional doenjang is darker than natto, which mainly retains the original soybean color.",
              "It\u2019s also vital to point out that natto has a strong smell and is more divisive regarding who enjoys it.",
              "Finally, the fermentation process is vastly different.",
              "Natto is usually made with a starter, though fermenting it without the bacterial culture is possible.",
              "The fermentation takes 24-36 hours before natto is ready for consumption.",
              "Doenjang doesn\u2019t need a starter, as the fermentation occurs naturally after many weeks and months.",
              "Here\u2019s a quick reminder of the natto vs. doenjang comparison: Comparing natto and doenjang isn\u2019t the same as asking whether you like more vanilla or chocolate ice cream.",

              "In a clinical trial, 36 healthy adults were randomly assigned to a 10-week diet that included either fermented or high-fiber foods.",
              "The two diets resulted in different effects on the gut microbiome and the immune system.",
              "Eating foods such as yogurt, kefir, fermented cottage cheese, kimchi and other fermented vegetables, vegetable brine drinks, and kombucha tea led to an increase in overall microbial diversity, with stronger effects from larger servings.",
              "\u201cThis is a stunning finding,\u201d said Justin Sonnenburg, PhD, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology.",
              "\u201cIt provides one of the first examples of how a simple change in diet can reproducibly remodel the microbiota across a cohort of healthy adults.",
              "\u201d In addition, four types of immune cells showed less activation in the fermented-food group.",
              "The levels of 19 inflammatory proteins measured in blood samples also decreased.",
              "One of these proteins, interleukin 6, has been linked to conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Type 2 diabetes and chronic stress.",
              "\u201cMicrobiota-targeted diets can change immune status, providing a promising avenue for decreasing inflammation in healthy adults,\u201d said Christopher Gardner, PhD, the Rehnborg Farquhar Professor and director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center.",
              "\u201cThis finding was consistent across all participants in the study who were assigned to the higher fermented food group.",
              "\u201d Justin Sonnenburg By contrast, none of these 19 inflammatory proteins decreased in participants assigned to a high-fiber diet rich in legumes, seeds, whole grains, nuts, vegetables and fruits.",
              "On average, the diversity of their gut microbes also remained stable.",
              "\u201cWe expected high fiber to have a more universally beneficial effect and increase microbiota diversity,\u201d said Erica Sonnenburg, PhD, a senior research scientist in basic life sciences, microbiology and immunology.",
              "\u201cThe data suggest that increased fiber intake alone over a short time period is insufficient to increase microbiota diversity.",
              "\u201d The study published online July 12 in Cell.",
              "Justin and Erica Sonnenburg and Christopher Gardner are co-senior authors.",
              "The lead authors are Hannah Wastyk, a PhD student in bioengineering, and former postdoctoral scholar Gabriela Fragiadakis, PhD, who is now an assistant professor of medicine at UC-San Francisco.",
              "A wide body of evidence has demonstrated that diet shapes the gut microbiome, which can affect the immune system and overall health.",
              "According to Gardner, low microbiome diversity has been linked to obesity and diabetes.",
              "\u201cWe wanted to conduct a proof-of-concept study that could test whether microbiota-targeted food could be an avenue for combatting the overwhelming rise in chronic inflammatory diseases,\u201d Gardner said.",
              "The researchers focused on fiber and fermented foods due to previous reports of their potential health benefits.",
              "While high-fiber diets have been associated with lower rates of mortality, the consumption of fermented foods can help with weight maintenance and may decrease the risk of diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease.",
              "Erica Sonnenburg The researchers analyzed blood and stool samples collected during a three-week pre-trial period, the 10 weeks of the diet, and a four-week period after the diet when the participants ate as they chose.",
              "The findings paint a nuanced picture of the influence of diet on gut microbes and immune status.",
              "On one hand, those who increased their consumption of fermented foods showed similar effects on their microbiome diversity and inflammatory markers, consistent with prior research showing that short-term changes in diet can rapidly alter the gut microbiome.",
              "On the other hand, the limited change in the microbiome within the high-fiber group dovetails with the researchers\u2019 previous reports of a general resilience of the human microbiome over short time periods.",
              "The results also showed that greater fiber intake led to more carbohydrates in stool samples, pointing to incomplete fiber degradation by gut microbes.",
              "These findings are consistent with other research suggesting that the microbiome of people living in the industrialized world is depleted of fiber-degrading microbes.",
              "\u201cIt is possible that a longer intervention would have allowed for the microbiota to adequately adapt to the increase in fiber consumption,\u201d Erica Sonnenburg said.",
              "\u201cAlternatively, the deliberate introduction of fiber-consuming microbes may be required to increase the microbiota\u2019s capacity to break down the carbohydrates.",
              "\u201d In addition to exploring these possibilities, the researchers plan to conduct studies in mice to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which diets alter the microbiome and reduce inflammatory proteins.",
              "They also aim to test whether high-fiber and fermented foods synergize to influence the microbiome and immune system of humans.",
              "Another goal is to examine whether the consumption of fermented food decreases inflammation or improves other health markers in patients with immunological and metabolic diseases, and in pregnant women and older individuals.",
              "Christopher Gardner \u201cThere are many more ways to target the microbiome with food and supplements, and we hope to continue to investigate how different diets, probiotics and prebiotics impact the microbiome and health in different groups,\u201d Justin Sonnenburg said.",

              "The most popular kimchi includes baechu kimchi (made with napa cabbage, \u1107\u1162\u110e\u116e\u1100\u1175\u11b7\u110e\u1175), kkakdugi (made with radish, \u1101\u1161\u11a8\u1103\u116e\u1100\u1175), and oi kimchi (made with cucumber, \u110b\u1169\u110b\u1175\u1100\u1175\u11b7\u110e\u1175).",
              "One of the advantages of homemade kimchi is that you can control the flavor by controlling the ingredients that go into it.",
              "By making it at home, you can use the ingredients that suit your dietary requirement (e.",
              "g. vegan kimchi) as well.",
              "You can also control the fermentation process better to meet your taste buds by controlling the temperature of the environment.",
              "Meanwhile, if you want to learn more about the health benefits of kimchi in general, check out this article from WebMD.",
              "Kimchi has quite a complex flavor and not every kimchi has the same taste.",
              "First, it is slightly salty because it has been pickled in salty brine for as little as 30 minutes to overnight.",
              "Second, it is slightly spicy in general, excluding white kimchi, which does not use any Korean chili flakes.",
              "Third, it has umami flavor.",
              "It\u2019s also seasoned with Korean fish sauce to aid fermentation, so as time goes by, the deeper the kimchi\u2019s flavor develops.",
              "Forth, ripened kimchi is sour and has a pungent smell.",
              "This stage of kimchi is great for cooking.",
              "Though one thing I know is that even though many people love kimchi, there are many people who don\u2019t like it because of its strong garlic smell and taste.",
              "Also, the longer it ferments, the stronger the smell and flavor will be, as if something is rotting in your fridge.",
              "Making kimchi successfully is more challenging than you might think.",
              "That\u2019s because there are many variables that could go wrong.",
              "I will highlight some important aspects of making kimchi at home.",
              "Based on my experience, the initial, and most critical step in the process of making a successful kimchi is to brine the napa cabbage.",
              "Brining kimchi cabbage uses the osmotic action of salt to dehydrate the cabbage and season it at an appropriate salinity.",
              "Through this process, the fresh smell of cabbage is removed and the growth of various germs that cause the kimchi to become soft is prevented.",
              "Furthermore, it creates an environment in which lactic acid bacteria and enzymes are easy to grow, and this interaction between them allows the kimchi to ripen properly.",
              "Also, if you over-brine kimchi, it can turn out very salty, and there\u2019s nothing you can do to fix this failure.",
              "Therefore, it\u2019s important to know the right way to salt it when making kimchi.",
              "Traditionally, making kimchi has been a whole day process.",
              "Particularly if it involves kimjang, a Korean traditional kimchi making activity during winter months, it could take two days to complete, depending on the batch size.",
              "Any how, if you decided to follow my recipe, I suggest you don\u2019t change the pickling time as it can affect the taste.",
              "I tested different brining time and 6 hours turned out to be the sweet spot.",
              "If you pickle for too long, your kimchi will turn out to be very salty.",
              "If you pickle for a shorter time, kimchi can taste bland and it might not ferment well.",
              "It can even get mouldy quicker too.",
              "When seasoning the pickled cabbage with the kimchi paste, make sure you mentally portion out the seasoning well from the beginning so that you don\u2019t run out of the paste until the end.",
              "Bear in mind that kimchi won\u2019t look very red immediately after being seasoned.",
              "It will gradually turn redder over time during the long fermentation process.",
              "Making kimchi can be challenging enough, finding the right kimchi ingredients can add an additional layer of frustration to the whole experience.",
              "As someone who was born & raised in Korea, I can\u2019t imagine substituting Korean ingredients for kimchi, even though I can for other Korean dishes.",
              "Anyhow, here are some questions I bet you have for me, with my answers.",
              "I think gochugaru is irreplaceable, especially when it comes to kimchi, but then again, there are many people who try other combinations of chili flakes just because they can\u2019t make kimchi otherwise.",
              "These people often use hot paprika powder and/or dry chili flakes as a combination.",
              "Just remember that gochugaru is more of a mild type of chili flakes, so if you use these combinations, you will have to play around a bit until the ratio is right to your taste.",
              "Many people point out that Korean fish sauce is more pungent and salty than Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce.",
              "These people often state that you should never substitute these for Korean fish sauce, as it can ruin your kimchi to the point that your kimchi may rot instead of fermenting over time.",
              "That being said, I\u2019ve seen other people using Red Boat 40N and Three Crabs fish sauce quite successfully in their kimchi.",
              "I wouldn\u2019t know how, or if, the taste differs compared to when you use Korean fish sauce.",
              "I\u2019m too scared to let my hard work on kimchi fail this way, so I haven\u2019t tried it myself.",
              "But one of these days, I shall sacrifice on your behalf.",
              "But until then, I will let you make your own choice.",
              "I will reiterate it.",
              "Your safest bet here is using Korean fish sauce \u2013 anchovy sauce, sand lance sauce or similar etc.",
              "But if these options are not viable, then take your chance.",
              "Saeujeot is typically found at a large Korean grocer, either in the fridge or freezer section.",
              "General Asian grocers or small Korean grocers may not carry it if demand is low.",
              "If you can\u2019t find saeujeot, you can substitute it with Korean fish sauce.",
              "The main ingredients you will have to substitute to veganize the kimchi is the Korean fish sauce and saeujeot (salted fermented small shrimps).",
              "For these, you could use vegan fish sauce or soy sauce / tamari.",
              "While the highlight of napa cabbage kimchi is the napa cabbage, you can add other green vegetables to give more texture.",
              "These include chives, mustard greens, water parsley, and young radish greens.",
              "Though there is no need to fret if you can\u2019t find them.",
              "These are nice to have ingredients, but not essential.",
              "It is important to know how to store kimchi properly in order to keep it \u201cfresh\u201d longer.",
              "The best ways to store kimchi is to keep it in an airtight container and in the refrigerator.",
              "Even better, if you have a specialty fridge like a \u201ckimchi refrigerator\u201d at home, as it will help store kimchi at the perfect temperature.",
              "A constant cold temperature will help prevent spoilage and maintain optimal kimchi quality.",
              "As for the airtight container, if you live near a place with a high Korean population, you may be able to buy a \u201ckimchi container\u201d as well.",
              "I recommend a stainless steel container in this regard or, at the very least, a BPA-free plastic container.",
              "These kimchi containers go beyond regular airtight containers.",
              "Kimchi in these containers really last much longer.",
              "One of my kimchi batches still tasted as new even after 4 weeks of fermentation in the fridge.",
              "To ferment faster, I eventually transferred it into a different container.",
              "This allowed us to have more of that tangy kimchi flavor.",
              "So storage containers do make a difference in the quality and taste of kimchi.",
              "But, be sure to only fill your kimchi container up to 70 or 80% of the way full.",
              "This is to prevent the kimchi liquid from overflowing and allow the gas generated by fermentation to circulate around the container instead of out.",
              "The more time kimchi is exposed to oxygen, the quicker it will ferment.",
              "This can result in mold developing and raise the risk of a foul odor.",
              "For kimchi storage, an ideal temperature is 3-5 degrees Celsius.",
              "So try to minimize opening the fridge door as that leads to fluctuations in the fridge\u2019s internal temperature.",
              "Kimchi can typically last in the fridge for a couple of months, but depending on the storage conditions you could keep it for up to a year or so too.",
              "There are many other dishes you can create with kimchi such as Kimchi Fried Rice, Kimchi Jjigae, and Kimchi Pancake.",
              "But if you want even more ideas, check my How to Eat to Kimchi post.",

              "Pinch some cooking salt (1/2 cup total for all pickled cabbages) and rub over the thick white part of the cabbage.",
              "Open each leaf gently and sprinkle the salt over the thick white part.",
              "Repeat this for the rest of the cabbage.",
              "Reserve the saltwater from when you soaked the cabbage for later use.",
              "3.",
              "Put the salted cabbage in a large food grade plastic bag or large bucket (wedge side of the cabbage to be facing up) and pour in the reserved saltwater from step 2.",
              "Close the plastic bag.",
              "If using a bucket, get something heavy on top of the cabbage to press down (e.",

              "Set the cabbage aside for 6 hours to pickle.",
              "Rotate the cabbage upside down every 2 hours.",
              "Using a large food grade plastic bag will make the turning process much easier than using a large bucket.",
              "4.",
              "Once the soaking process is finished, rinse the cabbages in running water, especially the thick white part of the cabbage, to get rid of the salt.",

              "Add Korean chives, carrots, minced garlic, minced ginger, sugar, blended onion, and the Korean chili flakes mixture from step 5.",

              "That said, Japan has several unique spices which add a different type of heat to food when compared to spices more commonly found elsewhere, such as chili and pepper.",
              "The main Japanese spices are wasabi, seven spice, yuzu kosho and sansho (Japanese pepper).",
              "Some people include karashi (mustard), too.",

              "The type of spice found in wasabi is different to that of spicy curry.",
              "Rather than a hot sensation, it is more of a cooler spiciness.",

              "Europeans and Americans began residing in some Japanese coastal towns to further hasten trade.",
              "Locals, somewhat undernourished at the time \u2013 since Japan was a poor, undeveloped nation (though hard to imagine now) and because, for the previous millennium, eating meat was largely prohibited \u2013 collectively came to the conclusion that the much taller, beefier Westerners were stronger and healthier than the Japanese.",
              "And so, the common wisdom at the time was that they should start eating Western food.",
              "In 1872, it was announced to the nation that Emperor Meiji had, in fact, eaten beef.",
              "And so began Japan\u2019s fascination with Western food.",

              "By the very nature of the Japanese archipelago, which is made up of many islands and stretches for more than 3,500 kilometers, Japanese cuisine is first and foremost a regional (or even local) cuisine, in which certain major principles are expressed in accordance with the local tastes and ingredients available.",
              "The result is a wide variety of dishes;",
              "however, these kitchens have gradually been marked both by common changes in consumption patterns across the country and by foreign innovations (new ingredients, new culinary techniques) quickly accepted, disseminated and adapted throughout the country.",
              "Jo\u0304mon Period (-14000 \u2013 -400 BCE) The Jo\u0304mon period corresponds to the Japanese protohistory.",
              "During this period, food in Japan has gradually evolved from the traditional diet of nomadic hunter-gatherers to that of sedentary peoples mastering agriculture and cooking.",
              "In prehistoric Japan, the Jo\u0304mon people living in Japan were mainly semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers.",
              "The Jo\u0304mon islands have a great diversity of Natural Resources in all the biotopes of their archipelago : in spring and early summer, deep-sea fish species (Tunas and bonitos) and marine mammals are fished as they approach the coast to breed.",
              "Salmon and other marine species brought back by the Oyashio current are also caught.",
              "On the shores of the Sea of Japan and the Pacific, there are numerous shellfish aggregations that show the strong presence of shellfish in the diet.",
              "During this period, the most practiced ways of getting food were river fishing and hunting.",
              "In the late fall and throughout the winter, deer and wild boar are hunted, as are bear, deer and Hare.",
              "Many local tree species provide large amounts of food for humans and animals.",
              "In autumn, the fruits and seeds are ready to be picked, and the harvest of chestnuts, nuts, hazelnuts and Acorns is stored in many underground silos.",
              "Yams and other wild plants supplement the diet.",
              "Although agricultural techniques have not yet been certified, there has been a gradual development in the cultivation of certain types of plants, such as squash, hazelnut and millet.",
              "There is evidence that soybeans were already present in Japan and probably cultivated during the Jo\u0304mon period, with significant variations in seed size indicating human hand selection, probably in multiple locations in Korea, China, and Japan before 5000 BCE, and in large amounts from around 3000 BCE.",
              "The first proof of cooking comes from the pottery.",

              "Chinese sources from the 3rd Century report that the people of Wa lived on raw vegetables, rice and fish served on wooden and bamboo platters (takatsuki), that they had granaries and provincial markets, and ate with their hands, baguettes not yet being present.",
              "In a history written in Kojiki, Takahashi ujibumi, and Nihon shoki, Emperor Keiko\u0304 named Iwakamutsukari no Mikoto, chief of the imperial court, having greatly appreciated a dish combining bonito and Palourde.",
              "Today, he is considered the founder of Japanese seasoning culture.",

              "According to some, the production of rice sake was introduced from China to Japan shortly after rice cultivation, spreading from West to east from Kyu\u0304shu\u0304 and Kinki.",
              "The inoculation of ferment was of the most primitive, so-called kuchikami ( \u201cchewed in the mouth\u201d), the cooked cereals being saccharified by saliva, and the making of sake was said to be kamosu, derived from the verb kamu (\u201cchew\u201d, \u201cbite\u201d) .",
              "However, the advent of sake-making methods such as those that persist today will not take place until the 12th century.",
              "The confirmation of the presence of sake can be found in Kojiki, the first Japanese history, which was made in the year 712 AD.",
              "The Yamato Period (250-710 AD) The Yamato period was the scene of many Korean and Chinese migrations, introducing Confucianism and Buddhism, which triggered the first decree banning meat consumption.",
              "Traditional ingredients such as soy sauce come from trade with neighbouring nations ;",
              "sake is becoming more common.",
              "There is little information on the culinary practices of this period.",
              "It should be noted, however, that strong waves of Chinese (in the fifth century) and Korean (in the fourth century) immigration may have had a significant impact.",
              "The introduction of Buddhism in Japan was attributed to King Baekje Seong in year 538.",
              "The Soga clan, a family of the court that accompanied the rise of the Emperor Kinmei around 531 AD, pushed for the adoption of Buddhism and a Chinese Confucian cultural model, but encountered strong opposition from the Nakatomi clan, who was responsible for shinto rituals at the court, as well as from the Mononobe clan.",
              "For more than a century, wars of influence have taken place to fight Buddhism.",

              "Consumption of pests, fallow deer and wild boar was not prohibited.",
              "This ban was renewed throughout the Asuka period, but ended in the Heian period.",

              "The soy sauce, originally from China, originated from a paste called hishio, first made with meat and fish marinade, then with soybean seeds and flour.",
              "It was introduced to Japan during the Fujiwara period (694-710).",
              "Traditional Cuisine Japanese cuisine can be defined strictly as the traditional Japanese cuisine, called nihon ryo\u0304ri (\u0583\u0583\u0583 or washoku) preceding the Meiji Era, which saw the introduction of recipes and cooking techniques from abroad.",
              "Nara Period (710 AD -794 AD) The Nara era brought many changes : the mastery of fermentation increased, and ingredients such as bread and natto were introduced.",
              "Seasonings previously reduced to vinegar and salt were superseded by the ancestors of the classic seasonings miso, hishio (the ancestor of soy sauce), and shi.",
              "Fermentation is an essential process for the preparation of many ingredients in japanese cuisine (to name only the most famous : miso, sake, soy sauce, rice vinegar, mirin, tsukemono, natto, katsuobushi, kusaya ).",
              "While some processes such as manufacturing are known, fermentation remains a process dependent on the control of the fungus used for fermentation.",
              "Evidence of early mastery appears, such as the Kin-jinja temple in Shiga Prefecture, dedicated to the fungus used in the production of narezushi.",
              "In this most primitive type of sushi, the fish was salted and coated in fermented rice.",
              "Nare-zushi was a gutted fish and could be stored for months, with fermented rice preserving the fish from rot.",

              "The natto, now traditional ingredient of the Japanese diet, is introduced in its 2 most common versions (itohiki-natto and shiokara-natto) during the Nara period by a Buddhist monk.",
              "Its consumption will be promoted by the progressive spread of Buddhist vegetarian practices.",
              "The Japanese brought bing (bread) from China, a Chinese unleavened bread similar to French pancakes, following contacts with the Chinese dynasties Sui (581-618) and Tang (618-907)20.",
              "There is evidence that miso, hishio (the ancestor of soy sauce, a paste made from soy), and shi (soy nuggets) occupy a very important place in Japanese seasoning, part of the code Yo\u0304ro\u0304, a form of code regulating the life of ancient Japan being dedicated to them and stipulating how to use them.",

              "Originally reserved for ritual and religious uses, the chopsticks introduced from China at the same time as Confucianism began to be used for daily food and spread among the people, as evidenced by the development of the chopsticks trade in Japan.",
              "In Japan, it is a popular tradition that tofu came from China, brought by the Buddhist monk Kanshin (\u0583\u0583\u0583), in 754 AD or as in another version of the story, by the zen monk Ingen, who would have introduced it in 1654 AD.",
              "Instead of repeating the prevailing view, Shinoda Osamu undertook a study of ancient Japanese texts.",

              "The obligation not to eat meat forced the monks to seek vegetarian and nourishing dishes as an alternative to animal protein.",
              "So we can assume with Huang, that tofu probably came to Japan at the end of the Tang or under the Song.",
              "It was probably brought by buddhist monks at a time when cultural exchanges between the two countries were intense.",
