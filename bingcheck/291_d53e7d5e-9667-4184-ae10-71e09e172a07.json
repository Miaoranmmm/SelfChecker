    "query": "Can you explain the process and technology behind the creation of artificial diamonds, and how do they differ in terms of quality and value compared to natural diamonds?",
    "response": "Sure, I can explain the process and technology behind the creation of artificial diamonds. Artificial diamonds are also known as **lab-grown diamonds** or **synthetic diamonds**[^2^]. They are made of pure carbon, just like natural diamonds, but they are produced in a controlled technological process instead of a geological process[^2^].\n\nThere are two main methods for creating artificial diamonds: **high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT)** and **chemical vapor deposition (CVD)**[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].\n\nThe HPHT method mimics the conditions deep within the earth where natural diamonds form. A small piece of carbon is placed in a chamber with a metal catalyst, such as iron or nickel. The chamber is then subjected to extremely high pressure and temperature, which cause the carbon atoms to bond and form a diamond crystal[^1^] [^3^]. This method can produce diamonds of various colors, depending on the type and amount of impurities in the carbon source[^2^].\n\nThe CVD method uses a plasma to deposit carbon atoms onto a substrate, such as a diamond seed or a silicon wafer. The plasma is created by heating a gas mixture, such as methane and hydrogen, in a vacuum chamber. The carbon atoms from the gas attach to the substrate and grow into a diamond layer[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. This method can create diamonds of any size, shape, or color, and it is cheaper and faster than the HPHT method[^2^] [^3^].\n\nArtificial diamonds have the same chemical and physical properties as natural diamonds, such as hardness, thermal conductivity, and optical transparency[^2^]. However, they may differ in terms of quality and value depending on their origin, size, color, clarity, cut, and certification[^1^]. Generally speaking, artificial diamonds are less expensive than natural diamonds of comparable quality, but they may also have lower resale value and demand[^1^]. Some consumers may prefer natural diamonds for their rarity and sentimental value, while others may choose artificial diamonds for their ethical and environmental benefits[^1^].\n\nI hope this explanation was helpful. If you have any more questions about artificial diamonds or natural diamonds, please feel free to ask me.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "[1] also called laboratory-grown, laboratory-created, man-made, artisan-created, artificial, synthetic, or cultured diamond) is diamond that is produced in a controlled technological process (in contrast to naturally formed diamond, which is created through geological processes and obtained by mining).",
              "Unlike diamond simulants (imitations of diamond made of superficially similar non-diamond materials), synthetic diamonds are composed of the same material as naturally formed diamonds \u2013 pure carbon crystallized in an isotropic 3D form \u2013 and share identical chemical and physical properties.",
              "Numerous claims of diamond synthesis were reported between 1879 and 1928;",
              "most of these attempts were carefully analyzed but none was confirmed.",
              "In the 1940s, systematic research of diamond creation began in the United States, Sweden and the Soviet Union, which culminated in the first reproducible synthesis in 1953.",
              "Further research activity yielded the discoveries of high pressure high temperature diamond (HPHT) and CVD diamond, named for their production method (high-pressure high-temperature and chemical vapor deposition, respectively).",
              "These two processes still dominate synthetic diamond production.",
              "A third method in which nanometer-sized diamond grains are created in a detonation of carbon-containing explosives, known as detonation synthesis, entered the market in the late 1990s.",
              "A fourth method, treating graphite with high-power ultrasound, has been demonstrated in the laboratory, but currently has no commercial application.",
              "The properties of man-made diamond depend on the manufacturing process.",
              "Some synthetic diamonds have properties such as hardness, thermal conductivity and electron mobility that are superior to those of most naturally formed diamonds.",
              "Synthetic diamond is widely used in abrasives, in cutting and polishing tools and in heat sinks.",
              "Electronic applications of synthetic diamond are being developed, including high-power switches at power stations, high-frequency field-effect transistors and light-emitting diodes.",
              "Synthetic diamond detectors of ultraviolet (UV) light or high-energy particles are used at high-energy research facilities and are available commercially.",
              "Due to its unique combination of thermal and chemical stability, low thermal expansion and high optical transparency in a wide spectral range, synthetic diamond is becoming the most popular material for optical windows in high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons.",
              "It is estimated that 98% of industrial-grade diamond demand is supplied with synthetic diamonds.",
              "[2] Both CVD and HPHT diamonds can be cut into gems and various colors can be produced: clear white, yellow, brown, blue, green and orange.",
              "The advent of synthetic gems on the market created major concerns in the diamond trading business, as a result of which special spectroscopic devices and techniques have been developed to distinguish synthetic and natural diamonds.",
              "In the early stages of diamond synthesis, the founding figure of modern chemistry, Antoine Lavoisier, played a significant role.",
              "His groundbreaking discovery that a diamond's crystal lattice is similar to carbon's crystal structure paved the way for initial attempts to produce diamonds.",
              "[3] After it was discovered that diamond was pure carbon in 1797,[4][5] many attempts were made to convert various cheap forms of carbon into diamond.",
              "[6][a] The earliest successes were reported by James Ballantyne Hannay in 1879[11] and by Ferdinand Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Henri Moissan in 1893.",
              "Their method involved heating charcoal at up to 3,500 \u00b0C (6,330 \u00b0F) with iron inside a carbon crucible in a furnace.",
              "Whereas Hannay used a flame-heated tube, Moissan applied his newly developed electric arc furnace, in which an electric arc was struck between carbon rods inside blocks of lime.",
              "[12] The molten iron was then rapidly cooled by immersion in water.",
              "The contraction generated by the cooling supposedly produced the high pressure required to transform graphite into diamond.",
              "Moissan published his work in a series of articles in the 1890s.",
              "[6][13] Many other scientists tried to replicate his experiments.",
              "Sir William Crookes claimed success in 1909.",

              "[20][21] The most definitive replication attempts were performed by Sir Charles Algernon Parsons.",
              "A prominent scientist and engineer known for his invention of the steam turbine, he spent about 40 years (1882\u20131922) and a considerable part of his fortune trying to reproduce the experiments of Moissan and Hannay, but also adapted processes of his own.",
              "[22] Parsons was known for his painstakingly accurate approach and methodical record keeping;",
              "all his resulting samples were preserved for further analysis by an independent party.",
              "[23] He wrote a number of articles\u2014some of the earliest on HPHT diamond\u2014in which he claimed to have produced small diamonds.",

              "[20] The first known (but initially not reported) diamond synthesis was achieved on February 16, 1953, in Stockholm by ASEA (Allma\u0308nna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget), Sweden's major electrical equipment manufacturing company.",

              "A few small diamonds were produced, but not of gem quality or size.",
              "Due to questions on the patent process and the reasonable belief that no other serious diamond synthesis research occurred globally, the board of ASEA opted against publicity and patent applications.",
              "Thus the announcement of the ASEA results occurred shortly after the GE press conference of February 15, 1955.",
              "[28] In 1941, an agreement was made between the General Electric (GE), Norton and Carborundum companies to further develop diamond synthesis.",

              "Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall.",
              "The GE team used tungsten carbide anvils within a hydraulic press to squeeze the carbonaceous sample held in a catlinite container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into a gasket.",
              "The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions,[29] and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.",

              "[31] The press used a pyrophyllite container in which graphite was dissolved within molten nickel, cobalt or iron.",

              "Shigley July 25, 2016 Gem-quality synthetic or laboratory-grown diamonds are more available in today\u2019s jewelry marketplace than ever before, causing both interest and concern about lab-grown diamonds and whether gemologists or gemological labs can identify them.",
              "GIA has studied lab-grown or manmade diamonds extensively over the past 30 years, and we know a great deal about the methods used to produce them and how they can be recognized.",
              "While synthetic diamonds are produced in factories, their chemical and physical properties correspond very closely to that of natural diamonds.",
              "Some people might refer to lab-grown diamonds as imitations or simulants, but this is incorrect.",
              "Actual imitations like cubic zirconia or synthetic moissanite \u2014 which only look like diamond \u2014 have very different chemical and physical properties that allow trained gemologists to identify them easily.",
              "However, lab-grown diamonds are more challenging to detect.",
              "In some cases, a trained gemologist can recognize these CVD/HPHT grown and treated diamonds by using standard gem-testing equipment.",
              "In other cases, identification requires testing the diamond using advanced scientific instruments.",
              "At GIA, we have a large database on the gemological properties of many different types of diamonds, which we use to develop additional methods of diamond identification.",
              "Scientists first grew diamonds in a laboratory in the mid-1950s.",
              "These diamonds were too small for jewelry, however.",
              "Production of larger, gem-quality crystals began in the mid-1990s and continues to today, with more and more companies producing synthetic diamonds.",
              "Synthetic diamonds are grown in several countries for both jewelry and industrial purposes \u2014 with industrial use being the primary function of the material (Large Colorless HPHT Synthetic Gem Diamonds from China, Gem News International, Gems & Gemology, Spring 2016, Vol.",

              "With the traditional diamond growth method, called high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT), synthetic diamonds are produced from carbon material in apparatuses that mimic the high pressure, high temperature conditions of natural diamond formation in the earth.",
              "The newer method, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), involves filling a vacuum chamber with carbon-containing gas that crystallizes on a synthetic diamond seed.",
              "This method uses lower temperatures and pressures than HPHT.",
              "Both methods are currently popular methods of diamond growth.",
              "The CVD diamond growth method requires a lower upfront equipment cost than HPHT but may require subsequent treatment to improve the color of the diamonds grown.",

              "This diamond growth process subjects carbon to extreme temperatures and pressures and is meant to replicate the extreme heat and pressure conditions deep within the earth where natural diamonds form.",
              "In greater detail, HPHT diamond growth takes place in a small capsule inside an apparatus capable of generating very high pressures.",
              "Within the capsule, a carbon starting material, such as graphite, dissolves in a molten flux consisting of metals such as iron (Fe), nickel (Ni) or cobalt (Co), which lowers the temperature and pressure needed for diamond growth.",
              "The carbon material then migrates through the flux towards the cooler diamond seed and crystallizes on it to form a synthetic diamond crystal.",
              "Crystallization occurs over a period of several days to weeks to grow one or several crystals.",
              "While natural diamond crystals tend to form as octahedrons, HPHT synthetic diamond crystals typically have cubic faces in addition to octahedral ones.",
              "Because the shapes of natural and HPHT synthetic diamond crystals are different, their internal growth patterns also differ dramatically.",
              "These growth patterns are among the most reliable ways to separate natural from synthetic diamond crystals.",
              "The resulting faceted synthetic gems often exhibit distinctive color distribution, fluorescence zoning and graining patterns related to their cross-shaped growth-sector structure and also sometimes contain dark flux-metal inclusions.",

              "In greater detail, CVD diamond growth takes place inside a vacuum chamber filled with a hydrogen and carbon-containing gas, such as methane.",
              "A source of energy \u2014 such as a microwave beam \u2014 breaks down the gas molecules, and the carbon atoms diffuse towards the colder, flat diamond seed plates.",

              "Color zoning is a particularly important diagnostic feature.",
              "HPHT colored synthetic diamonds often display geometric color zoning due to how elements, such as nitrogen, concentrate in the crystal as it forms. Natural diamonds will occasionally display color zoning, but their color zoning will not have geometric patterns like with HPHT synthetic diamonds.",
              "CVD-grown synthetic diamonds, on the other hand, usually have even coloration.",
              "HPHT synthetic diamonds often contain metal flux inclusions that appear black and opaque in transmitted light but have a metallic luster in reflected light.",
              "That\u2019s because the metals used as catalysts during the HPHT growth process can sometimes enter the diamond crystal.",
              "These flux metal alloys contain elements such as iron, nickel and cobalt.",
              "Synthetic diamonds with larger metallic inclusions can therefore sometimes be picked up with magnets.",
              "CVD-grown synthetic diamonds do not have metallic inclusions.",
              "Rather, they often contain dark graphite inclusions or some other mineral inclusions that are a result of their unique growth process.",
              "Graphite inclusions appear different from metallic ones in that they do not have a metallic luster.",
              "When examined between two polarizing filters angled at 90-degrees to one another, natural diamonds often exhibits a bright crosshatched or mosaic pattern of interference or \u201cstrain\u201d colors.",
              "These interference colors arise from the diamond being subjected to incredible stress while deep in the earth or during its explosive eruption to the earth\u2019s surface.",
              "CVD synthetic diamonds tend to display banded \u201cstrain\u201d patterns, a marker that helps scientists tell them apart from HPHT synthetic diamonds.",
              "In contrast, HPHT grown synthetic diamonds grow in environments with nearly uniform pressure where they are not subjected to stress, so they display either no strain pattern or a weak banded strain pattern.",
              "The fluorescence of synthetic diamonds is also often helpful for identification.",
              "Synthetic diamond fluorescence is often stronger under short-wave than under long-wave ultraviolet light, while the opposite is true of natural diamonds that fluoresce.",
              "Synthetic diamond fluorescence also often occurs in a distinctive pattern.",
              "HPHT synthetic diamonds tend to show a cross-shaped fluorescence pattern on its crown or pavilion after being cut.",
              "CVD synthetic diamonds may show a striated (striped) pattern when viewed through their pavilion facets.",
              "Common fluorescence colors include green, yellow-green, yellow, orange and red.",

              "Of course, all diamond crystals form in the isometric system, and all these shapes fall within this system.",
              "Developed in the 1950s, HPHT was the first method developed for diamond synthesis.",
              "The process begins by placing into a press a capsule containing a carbon starting material, a mixture of metals called a metal flux, and a small diamond seed.",
              "The carbon starting material used in this process is usually graphite, a common mineral composed of pure carbon.",
              "The capsule is then heated to temperatures of 1,300o to 1,600o C and pressed to pressures up to 59,200 atm.",
              "This dissolves the carbon source into the metal flux.",
              "The makeup of the metal flux varies, but often includes a mixture of iron, nickel, and cobalt, which helps reduce the temperature needed for diamond formation.",
              "The dissolved carbon source can then pass through the molten metal mixture to crystallize around the diamond seed, forming a lab-grown diamond.",
              "The HPHT process can take from hours to weeks, depending on the desired size and quality of the stones.",
              "There are three types of presses commonly used in HPHT diamond synthesis: belt, cubic, and split-sphere (also known as BARS).",

              "Although a cubic press can apply greater pressure than a belt press, technicians can't scale it the same way as a belt press.",
              "As a result, cubic presses aren't used as often as belt presses.",
              "The split-sphere press uses eight outer anvils and six smaller inner anvils, in order to maximize pressure on the capsule.",
              "The cylindrical capsule is then placed into an oil-filled barrel to accelerate heat transfer.",
              "This helps achieve higher temperatures at a much faster rate.",

              "Next, a substrate is added to the chamber, usually a thin sliver of diamond seed, although graphite can also be used.",
              "The chamber is then heated to temperatures of 800o to 900o C, using microwaves, lasers, or a hot filament.",
              "The energy from the heat source causes the carbon to precipitate out of the gaseous mixture and stick to the substrate, which begins to crystalize into a diamond.",

              "Actual imitations like cubic zirconia or synthetic moissanite \u2014 which only look like diamond \u2014 have very different chemical and physical properties that allow trained gemologists to identify them easily.",
              "However, lab-grown diamonds are more challenging to detect.",
              "In some cases, a trained gemologist can recognize these CVD/HPHT grown and treated diamonds by using standard gem-testing equipment.",
              "In other cases, identification requires testing the diamond using advanced scientific instruments.",
              "At GIA, we have a large database on the gemological properties of many different types of diamonds, which we use to develop additional methods of diamond identification.",
              "Scientists first grew diamonds in a laboratory in the mid-1950s.",
              "These diamonds were too small for jewelry, however.",

              "In greater detail, HPHT diamond growth takes place in a small capsule inside an apparatus capable of generating very high pressures.",
              "Within the capsule, a carbon starting material, such as graphite, dissolves in a molten flux consisting of metals such as iron (Fe), nickel (Ni) or cobalt (Co), which lowers the temperature and pressure needed for diamond growth.",
              "The carbon material then migrates through the flux towards the cooler diamond seed and crystallizes on it to form a synthetic diamond crystal.",
              "Crystallization occurs over a period of several days to weeks to grow one or several crystals.",
              "While natural diamond crystals tend to form as octahedrons, HPHT synthetic diamond crystals typically have cubic faces in addition to octahedral ones.",
              "Because the shapes of natural and HPHT synthetic diamond crystals are different, their internal growth patterns also differ dramatically.",
              "These growth patterns are among the most reliable ways to separate natural from synthetic diamond crystals.",

              "This article is also a part of our Lab Grown Diamonds Fundamentals Mini Course, in the unit Introduction to Lab-Grown Diamonds.",
              "There are two main lab-grown diamond production methods: the high pressure/high temperature process (HPHT) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).",
              "Both methods are commonly used, but CVD is becoming more popular for producing gem-quality synthetic diamonds for jewelry.",
              "HPHT is used more often to create synthetic diamonds for industrial use.",
              "Both HPHT and CVD produce diamonds with the same optical, physical, and chemical properties as natural diamonds.",
              "However, these laboratory processes do leave some telltale signs that gemologists can identify by close inspection.",
              "In rough crystal form, the differences are more readily discernible.",
              "Natural diamonds form with eight sides of growth, forming an octahedral crystal shape.",
              "On the other hand, HPHT diamonds form in a cuboctahedron shape with 14 directions of growth.",
              "CVD diamonds form in a cubic shape with one direction of growth.",
              "Of course, all diamond crystals form in the isometric system, and all these shapes fall within this system.",
              "Developed in the 1950s, HPHT was the first method developed for diamond synthesis.",
              "The process begins by placing into a press a capsule containing a carbon starting material, a mixture of metals called a metal flux, and a small diamond seed.",
              "The carbon starting material used in this process is usually graphite, a common mineral composed of pure carbon.",
              "The capsule is then heated to temperatures of 1,300o to 1,600o C and pressed to pressures up to 59,200 atm.",
              "This dissolves the carbon source into the metal flux.",
              "The makeup of the metal flux varies, but often includes a mixture of iron, nickel, and cobalt, which helps reduce the temperature needed for diamond formation.",
              "The dissolved carbon source can then pass through the molten metal mixture to crystallize around the diamond seed, forming a lab-grown diamond.",
              "The HPHT process can take from hours to weeks, depending on the desired size and quality of the stones.",
              "There are three types of presses commonly used in HPHT diamond synthesis: belt, cubic, and split-sphere (also known as BARS).",
              "The belt press was the first press used in lab-grown diamond production.",
              "With various advancements and alterations, it remains in use today.",
              "The belt press uses two anvils to apply pressure to the capsule from above and below.",
              "The belt press led to the development of the cubic press.",
              "A cubic press functions like a belt press but uses six anvils, in order to work with larger, cubic materials.",
              "Although a cubic press can apply greater pressure than a belt press, technicians can't scale it the same way as a belt press.",
              "As a result, cubic presses aren't used as often as belt presses.",
              "The split-sphere press uses eight outer anvils and six smaller inner anvils, in order to maximize pressure on the capsule.",
              "The cylindrical capsule is then placed into an oil-filled barrel to accelerate heat transfer.",
              "This helps achieve higher temperatures at a much faster rate.",
              "Most HPHT diamonds will undergo further heat treatments after they come out of the presses.",
              "These treatments will improve their color and clarity and can even create fancy colored diamonds.",
              "For example, heat treatments with boron can turn HPHT diamonds blue.",
              "Heat treatments with nickel can turn HPHT diamonds green.",
              "Radiation treatments can also create pink and red colors in HPHT diamonds.",
              "The CVD process begins by filling a chamber with a mixture of gasses, including carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.",
              "Next, a substrate is added to the chamber, usually a thin sliver of diamond seed, although graphite can also be used.",
              "The chamber is then heated to temperatures of 800o to 900o C, using microwaves, lasers, or a hot filament.",
              "The energy from the heat source causes the carbon to precipitate out of the gaseous mixture and stick to the substrate, which begins to crystalize into a diamond.",
              "Technicians must stop the CVD process frequently, so they can remove any graphite that crystalizes around the diamond.",
              "CVD can take from days and weeks, depending on the desired size and quality of the stones.",
              "However, dozens of stones can be grown at the same time.",
              "Most CVD diamonds come out of the chamber with brown or yellow colors.",
              "In order to be sold as white or colorless diamonds, these stones must undergo heat treatment.",
              "After formation, CVD diamonds can also receive treatments to create fancy pink or red color.",
              "Adding boron or nitrogen into the chamber during formation can also create fancy colored blue or yellow colors in CVD diamonds.",

              "Shigley July 25, 2016 Gem-quality synthetic or laboratory-grown diamonds are more available in today\u2019s jewelry marketplace than ever before, causing both interest and concern about lab-grown diamonds and whether gemologists or gemological labs can identify them.",
              "GIA has studied lab-grown or manmade diamonds extensively over the past 30 years, and we know a great deal about the methods used to produce them and how they can be recognized.",
              "While synthetic diamonds are produced in factories, their chemical and physical properties correspond very closely to that of natural diamonds.",
              "Some people might refer to lab-grown diamonds as imitations or simulants, but this is incorrect.",
              "Actual imitations like cubic zirconia or synthetic moissanite \u2014 which only look like diamond \u2014 have very different chemical and physical properties that allow trained gemologists to identify them easily.",
              "However, lab-grown diamonds are more challenging to detect.",
              "In some cases, a trained gemologist can recognize these CVD/HPHT grown and treated diamonds by using standard gem-testing equipment.",
              "In other cases, identification requires testing the diamond using advanced scientific instruments.",
              "At GIA, we have a large database on the gemological properties of many different types of diamonds, which we use to develop additional methods of diamond identification.",
              "Scientists first grew diamonds in a laboratory in the mid-1950s.",
              "These diamonds were too small for jewelry, however.",
              "Production of larger, gem-quality crystals began in the mid-1990s and continues to today, with more and more companies producing synthetic diamonds.",

              "With the traditional diamond growth method, called high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT), synthetic diamonds are produced from carbon material in apparatuses that mimic the high pressure, high temperature conditions of natural diamond formation in the earth.",
              "The newer method, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), involves filling a vacuum chamber with carbon-containing gas that crystallizes on a synthetic diamond seed.",
              "This method uses lower temperatures and pressures than HPHT.",
              "Both methods are currently popular methods of diamond growth.",
              "The CVD diamond growth method requires a lower upfront equipment cost than HPHT but may require subsequent treatment to improve the color of the diamonds grown.",

              "This diamond growth process subjects carbon to extreme temperatures and pressures and is meant to replicate the extreme heat and pressure conditions deep within the earth where natural diamonds form.",
              "In greater detail, HPHT diamond growth takes place in a small capsule inside an apparatus capable of generating very high pressures.",
              "Within the capsule, a carbon starting material, such as graphite, dissolves in a molten flux consisting of metals such as iron (Fe), nickel (Ni) or cobalt (Co), which lowers the temperature and pressure needed for diamond growth.",
              "The carbon material then migrates through the flux towards the cooler diamond seed and crystallizes on it to form a synthetic diamond crystal.",
              "Crystallization occurs over a period of several days to weeks to grow one or several crystals.",
              "While natural diamond crystals tend to form as octahedrons, HPHT synthetic diamond crystals typically have cubic faces in addition to octahedral ones.",
              "Because the shapes of natural and HPHT synthetic diamond crystals are different, their internal growth patterns also differ dramatically.",
              "These growth patterns are among the most reliable ways to separate natural from synthetic diamond crystals.",
              "The resulting faceted synthetic gems often exhibit distinctive color distribution, fluorescence zoning and graining patterns related to their cross-shaped growth-sector structure and also sometimes contain dark flux-metal inclusions.",

              "In greater detail, CVD diamond growth takes place inside a vacuum chamber filled with a hydrogen and carbon-containing gas, such as methane.",
              "A source of energy \u2014 such as a microwave beam \u2014 breaks down the gas molecules, and the carbon atoms diffuse towards the colder, flat diamond seed plates.",

              "Therefore, it is important to use as many diagnostic features as possible when identifying a diamond.",
              "Color zoning is a particularly important diagnostic feature.",
              "HPHT colored synthetic diamonds often display geometric color zoning due to how elements, such as nitrogen, concentrate in the crystal as it forms. Natural diamonds will occasionally display color zoning, but their color zoning will not have geometric patterns like with HPHT synthetic diamonds.",
              "CVD-grown synthetic diamonds, on the other hand, usually have even coloration.",

              "That\u2019s because the metals used as catalysts during the HPHT growth process can sometimes enter the diamond crystal.",
              "These flux metal alloys contain elements such as iron, nickel and cobalt.",
              "Synthetic diamonds with larger metallic inclusions can therefore sometimes be picked up with magnets.",
              "CVD-grown synthetic diamonds do not have metallic inclusions.",
              "Rather, they often contain dark graphite inclusions or some other mineral inclusions that are a result of their unique growth process.",
              "Graphite inclusions appear different from metallic ones in that they do not have a metallic luster.",
              "When examined between two polarizing filters angled at 90-degrees to one another, natural diamonds often exhibits a bright crosshatched or mosaic pattern of interference or \u201cstrain\u201d colors.",
              "These interference colors arise from the diamond being subjected to incredible stress while deep in the earth or during its explosive eruption to the earth\u2019s surface.",
              "CVD synthetic diamonds tend to display banded \u201cstrain\u201d patterns, a marker that helps scientists tell them apart from HPHT synthetic diamonds.",
              "In contrast, HPHT grown synthetic diamonds grow in environments with nearly uniform pressure where they are not subjected to stress, so they display either no strain pattern or a weak banded strain pattern.",
              "The fluorescence of synthetic diamonds is also often helpful for identification.",
              "Synthetic diamond fluorescence is often stronger under short-wave than under long-wave ultraviolet light, while the opposite is true of natural diamonds that fluoresce.",
              "Synthetic diamond fluorescence also often occurs in a distinctive pattern.",
              "HPHT synthetic diamonds tend to show a cross-shaped fluorescence pattern on its crown or pavilion after being cut.",
              "CVD synthetic diamonds may show a striated (striped) pattern when viewed through their pavilion facets.",
              "Common fluorescence colors include green, yellow-green, yellow, orange and red.",

              "With this method, a diamond seed is placed into a chamber along with carbon and a metal catalyst.",
              "The assembly is then compressed with anvils and heated up, creating temperatures of 1300\u20131600\u00b0C and pressures of 5\u20136 GPa (roughly equivalent to the pressure exerted by a commercial jet airplane if balanced on the tip of a person\u2019s finger).",
              "After decades of research, the result is usually a colorless diamond crystal, but the HPHT method can also be used to grow colored diamonds.",

              "HPHT equipment can also be used to improve the color of lower-quality natural or lab-grown diamonds.",
              "Although this method predates growing diamonds by HPHT, more focus has been made recently to grow gem-quality diamonds through chemical vapor deposition (CVD).",
              "The newest, most recent technique of growing gem-quality diamonds is called chemical vapor deposition (CVD).",
              "This method enables scientists to grow synthetic diamonds using moderate temperatures (700\u00b0C to 1300\u00b0C) and lower pressures.",
              "Carbon-containing gas is pumped into a vacuum chamber, depositing onto a diamond seed and crystallizing as synthetic diamond.",
              "The eventual size of the diamond depends on the time allowed for growth.",
              "The growth process typically takes 4-6 weeks.",
              "The CVD growth process is typically more arduous and time-consuming because the diamond crystals generally have to be removed several times during growth process for the graphite layer forming around the diamond to be cleaned off, or the crystal will become polycrystalline instead of continuing to grow as one large crystal.",
              "After they are done growing, they often need HPHT treatment to change their color (making them more colorless or giving them fancy colors).",
              "Many LGD producers opt for the CVD growth process because their upfront equipment cost is lower than that of HPHT.",
              "In the past decade, laboratory-grown diamonds have grown in popularity, increased in size and improved in color and clarity, filling an important niche in the industry.",

              "What looks like a diamond may actually be a simulant, such as a cubic zirconia (CZ) or moissanite.",
              "Rather, the gemologist relies on scientific measures such as the stone\u2019s refractive index, density, spectroscopy and more to determine its identity.",
              "If a stone is identified as a diamond, it is then tested to verify if it is natural, treated or laboratory-grown.",
              "Laboratory-grown diamonds often have distinctive features such as graphitic or metallic inclusions (depending on the growth method), color zoning or graining patterns that can be seen under magnification.",
              "For example, the presence of nickel or other metals in a diamond, along with a lack of \u201cnatural\u201d features, indicate that the stone is most likely an HPHT-grown diamond.",
              "That\u2019s because HPHT diamonds often contain dark flux-metal inclusions from the chamber used in its growth process.",
              "CVD diamond, on the other hand, often contain dark graphitic inclusions.",
              "These characteristics can point scientists in a certain direction as to the diamond\u2019s identity but aren\u2019t always conclusive, however.",
              "That\u2019s why gemological laboratories also use absorption and luminescence spectroscopic techniques to identify diamonds.",
              "Some of these techniques involve using a spectrometer to measure a stone\u2019s photoluminescence after it has been excited by laser or using deep UV to illuminate a stone for fluorescence imaging.",
              "Photoluminescence spectroscopy is able to show precisely and accurately the defects within each diamond that are distinctive of the diamond\u2019s growth method.",
              "Under deep-UV illumination, an HPHT diamond will often display a cross-shaped pattern due to the way impurities concentrated when the stone formed.",

              "In CVD diamonds, photoluminescence spectroscopy can reveal the presence of several \u201cingredients,\u201d such as silicon, that are common to CVD diamonds.",
              "Under deep-UV illumination, CVD diamonds will also reveal that they grew layer by layer (like a stack of pancakes), a growth structure that is unique to diamonds with this growth method.",
              "After scientists have identified a diamond as laboratory-grown, they then evaluate the stone as meticulously as they would natural diamonds.",
              "For added disclosure and identification, the laboratory-grown diamond\u2019s girdle is laser inscribed with its report number and a statement that the stone is laboratory-grown.",

              "Within the capsule, a carbon starting material, such as graphite, dissolves in a molten flux consisting of metals such as iron (Fe), nickel (Ni) or cobalt (Co), which lowers the temperature and pressure needed for diamond growth.",

              "Of course, all diamond crystals form in the isometric system, and all these shapes fall within this system.",
              "Developed in the 1950s, HPHT was the first method developed for diamond synthesis.",
              "The process begins by placing into a press a capsule containing a carbon starting material, a mixture of metals called a metal flux, and a small diamond seed.",
              "The carbon starting material used in this process is usually graphite, a common mineral composed of pure carbon.",
              "The capsule is then heated to temperatures of 1,300o to 1,600o C and pressed to pressures up to 59,200 atm.",
              "This dissolves the carbon source into the metal flux.",
              "The makeup of the metal flux varies, but often includes a mixture of iron, nickel, and cobalt, which helps reduce the temperature needed for diamond formation.",
              "The dissolved carbon source can then pass through the molten metal mixture to crystallize around the diamond seed, forming a lab-grown diamond.",
              "The HPHT process can take from hours to weeks, depending on the desired size and quality of the stones.",
              "There are three types of presses commonly used in HPHT diamond synthesis: belt, cubic, and split-sphere (also known as BARS).",
              "The belt press was the first press used in lab-grown diamond production.",
              "With various advancements and alterations, it remains in use today.",

              "The belt press led to the development of the cubic press.",
              "A cubic press functions like a belt press but uses six anvils, in order to work with larger, cubic materials.",
              "Although a cubic press can apply greater pressure than a belt press, technicians can't scale it the same way as a belt press.",
              "As a result, cubic presses aren't used as often as belt presses.",
              "The split-sphere press uses eight outer anvils and six smaller inner anvils, in order to maximize pressure on the capsule.",
              "The cylindrical capsule is then placed into an oil-filled barrel to accelerate heat transfer.",
              "This helps achieve higher temperatures at a much faster rate.",
              "Most HPHT diamonds will undergo further heat treatments after they come out of the presses.",
              "These treatments will improve their color and clarity and can even create fancy colored diamonds.",

              "Radiation treatments can also create pink and red colors in HPHT diamonds.",
              "The CVD process begins by filling a chamber with a mixture of gasses, including carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.",
              "Next, a substrate is added to the chamber, usually a thin sliver of diamond seed, although graphite can also be used.",
              "The chamber is then heated to temperatures of 800o to 900o C, using microwaves, lasers, or a hot filament.",

              "Such a diamond is worth 50% less than an HPHT as-grown diamond.",
              "However, since most customers are unaware of the difference, most sellers offer both HPHT and CVD diamonds for the same price.",
              "CVD is not better than HPHT if both diamonds are as-grown and share identical grades.",
              "That being said, as far as I know, currently, only one lab in the world has the technology to produce untreated CVD diamonds.",
              "You can find those CVD as-grown diamonds on James Allen, mostly in oval, pear, and princess shapes.",
              "Regarding other labs, since they use post-growth treatment to enhance the beauty of the CVD diamonds, I recommend sticking to HPHT as-grown diamonds.",
              "Remember, CVD-treated diamonds should be sold for half the price of as-grown HPHT diamonds.",
