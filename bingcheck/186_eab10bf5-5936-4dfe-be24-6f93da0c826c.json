    "query": "What is the process and criteria for selecting the winners of the Nobel Prize, and how has this evolved over time since its inception in 1901?",
    "response": "The Nobel Prize is a prestigious international award that honors outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, peace and economics[^1^]. The Nobel Prize was established by the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist and inventor of dynamite, who died in 1896[^4^].\n\nThe selection process for the Nobel Prize varies depending on the category. For physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine and economics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is responsible for selecting the laureates. For literature, the Swedish Academy is in charge. For peace, the Norwegian Nobel Committee is the authority[^2^].\n\nThe nomination process for Nobel Prizes begins in September of the year prior to the prizes being awarded. At this time, the Nobel Committee sends out nomination forms to about 3,000 prominent academics in the fields relevant to the subject prizes[^6^]. The nomination deadline is usually January 31st of the award year. The nominees are then evaluated by experts and advisers appointed by the Nobel Committees. The final decision is made by a vote of the Nobel Committees in October. The names of the laureates are then announced to the public[^2^] [^4^] [^5^].\n\nThe criteria for selecting the Nobel Prize laureates are based on the original intention of Alfred Nobel, who wanted to reward those who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind[^2^]. However, over time, some changes and interpretations have been made to adapt to the changing world and scientific developments. For example, in 1968, a new prize in economic sciences was established by the Bank of Sweden in memory of Alfred Nobel[^4^]. In 2012, a new rule was introduced that allows up to three laureates to share a prize[^4^]. In addition, some controversies and criticisms have arisen over some of the nominations and selections, especially for the peace prize[^2^].",

              "Additionally, discoveries can be made simultaneously by different teams. However, the Nobel selection committees, according to the rules laid down by Alfred Nobel in 1895, can only honor up to three people per prize.",
              "This requirement can prove to be a headache, Rees said.",
              "\u201cIt may be a project where several people have done work in parallel, and they single out some and not others.",
              "It may be that there\u2019s a team, and it\u2019s not obvious that the ones they\u2019ve singled from the team are the dominant figures,\u201d said Rees, who is the UK\u2019s astronomer royal and author of \u201cIf Science Is to Save Us.",
              "\u201d For example, the 2017 Nobel in physics recognized the detection of gravitational waves \u2014 \u201cripples\u201d in space generated by colliding black holes 1 billion or more light-years away.",
              "The key papers reporting this discovery had almost 1,000 authors, Rees noted.",

              "\u201cWe start the process by asking a number of experts from around the world to write reports describing the field in which the discovery has been made, to outline the main discoveries in this field and also to mention individuals who have made the most important contributions,\u201d he explained via email.",

              "These are particle physics, atomic physics, cell biology, neuroscience and molecular chemistry.",
              "Rees, however, noted that taking the long view and giving greater recognition to certain fields can, at times, make the Nobel committees seem out of touch with the scientific priorities of the day.",
              "One example is artificial intelligence, or AI, which is transforming people\u2019s lives at an unprecedented pace.",
              "Two hot names in the field are Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, the Google DeepMind inventors of AlphaFold \u2014 an AI program that decodes the 3D structures of proteins from amino acid sequences.",
              "They won the $250,000 Lasker Prize this year and the Breakthrough Prize a year earlier.",
              "Since their key paper was published just over two years ago, it has been cited more than 8,500 times, Pendlebury said.",
              "Meet the man who has transformed our understanding of evolution \u201cThat is, in my experience, just incredible in terms of the speed at which the citations have accrued, so obviously, it\u2019s a huge, important intellectual discovery,\u201d said Pendlebury, who has been compiling his list of \u201ccitation laureates\u201d since 2002.",
              "The Nobel committees have on occasion awarded accolades to recent breakthroughs \u2014 such as when the chemistry prize went to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna in 2020, less than 10 years after their key 2012 paper on the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique \u2014 but Pendlebury thinks a Nobel Prize for AI this year is still a long shot.",
              "He said the Nobel Prize committees, at least for science prizes, are \u201cinnately conservative.",

              "Last year, Carolyn Bertozzi, who won the chemistry prize, was the only female winner of a science prize.",
              "There were no female science recipients in 2021 or in 2019, when the Nobel committee asked nominators to consider diversity in gender, geography and field.",

              "\u201cThey\u2019re looking at work typically published 20 or 30 years ago, when the number of women in science at elite levels was not as much as it is today,\u201d he said.",
              "\u201cAnd so I think as time goes forward, you see more and more women being selected.",
              "\u201d Others point to the issue as more evidence of systemic bias in science, with women already less likely to be given credit or named as lead author on scientific papers.",
              "\u201cThere are several women who made Nobel-level contributions to science, contributions for which male colleagues were awarded, but they were not,\u201d said Naomi Oreskes, a Henry Charles Lea Professor of the history of science and an affiliated professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Harvard University.",
              "\u201cThese examples prove that even when there were qualified women, they were systematically passed over.",
              "\u201d Rees attributes the diversity problem to a lack of transparency.",
              "The Nobel short list is secret, as are the nominators, and documents revealing the details of the selection process are sealed from public view for 50 years.",
              "Of course, these flaws and gaps only matter because the Nobels are far better known than other science prizes, Rees added.",
              "He prefers so-called challenge prizes, such as the XPrize, which incentivize future efforts to tackle an important problem, rather than rewarding past success.",
