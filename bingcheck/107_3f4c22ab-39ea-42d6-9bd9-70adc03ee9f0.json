              "His contributions to science changed the way we look at the universe.",
              "Born in Oxford, England, Hawking was a mediocre student as a child but went on to revolutionize physics and cosmology \u2014 the study of the origin and evolution of the universe.",
              "But he did something perhaps even more challenging: he brought such deep thinking about how the universe began and where it's going to the general public in his bestselling book, A Brief History of Time, which was later turned into a documentary.",
              "Hawking became a fixture in pop culture, with appearances on television shows such as The Big Bang Theory, The Simpsons and Star Trek: The Next Generation.",
              "While Hawking may be a household name, many people aren't necessarily familiar with his contributions to science.",
              "Here are a few of his most important ideas.",
              "Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, published in 1915, suggested the existence of black holes \u2014 an object whose gravitational pull is so intense that once something passes a region known as the event horizon, there's no escape.",
              "Over the years, the theory of black holes gained favour as further research supported their existence.",
              "In 1974, Hawking shocked the physics community by theorizing that some things can escape a black hole before crossing the event horizon.",
              "Subatomic particle pairs \u2014 such as photons and neutrinos \u2014 near that point of no return could result in one particle being ejected.",
              "This became known as Hawking radiation.",
              "Interestingly, Hawking initially didn't believe it possible.",
              "He only came to that conclusion when he tried to prove a young student, Jacob Bekenstein, who had initially made the suggestion, wrong.",
              "In 2014, Hawking released a paper titled Information Preservation and Weather Forecasting for Black Holes in which he surprised the astrophysics community by suggesting black holes weren't so black after all.",
              "He challenged his initial theory from 1974 that suggested nothing could escape a black hole after crossing the event horizon.",
              "His new paper said light may be able to pass through the point of no return area and leak information in the form of matter.",
              "However, he theorized that what comes out of it would not resemble what went in.",
              "So, for example, if a Tesla Roadster with a mannequin behind the wheel went into a black hole, the scrambled atoms that might come out would be unrecognizable.",
              "These days, the big bang theory is the widely accepted scientific explanation of the origin of our universe, but there was a time when the idea seemed preposterous.",
              "Even British astronomer Fred Hoyle, who coined the term in 1949, didn't believe the theory.",
              "In 1970, Hawking, along with fellow physicist Roger Penrose, suggested the universe began with a singularity, a location where space and time are indistinguishable.",
              "It's as if a black hole went in reverse.",
              "Their research supported the theory that the universe began with a big bang.",
              "While Hawking's theories revolutionized the way physicists think about the universe, he never won a Nobel Prize because his theories haven't been proven.",
              "For example, even if energy is released from a black hole, its temperature would be so low it would be difficult to measure.",
              "At one time, Hawking had hoped to find a theory that could explain all the physical aspects of the universe, one that could unite the theory of general relativity (the study of the very large aspects of our universe) and quantum theory (the study of the very small).",
              "But in 2010, Hawking admitted that science may never be able to find the \"theory of everything.\"",
              "While the renowned scientist is gone, it's likely that his theories will be discussed for a long time yet.",

              "[6][17][18] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.",
              "[19] Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians.",
              "In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics.",
              "In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology.",
              "In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him.",
              "[20][21] After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.",
              "[22] Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation.",
              "Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial.",
              "By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics.",
              "Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.",
              "He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.",

              "[189][173] In the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss.",

              "[280] In a method he used for the rest of his life, Hawking could now simply press a switch to select phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2,500\u20133,000 that were scanned.",

              "[284] The voice he used had an American accent and is no longer produced.",

              "[285] Hawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles,[288][289][290] with a rate of about one word per minute.",
              "[289] With this decline there was a risk of him developing locked-in syndrome, so Hawking collaborated with Intel Corporation researchers on systems that could translate his brain patterns or facial expressions into switch activations.",
              "After several prototypes that did not perform as planned, they settled on an adaptive word predictor made by the London-based startup SwiftKey, which used a system similar to his original technology.",
              "Hawking had an easier time adapting to the new system, which was further developed after inputting large amounts of Hawking's papers and other written materials and uses predictive software similar to other smartphone keyboards.",
              "[181][280][290][291] By 2009, he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently, but the same people who created his new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his chair using movements made by his chin.",
              "This proved difficult, since Hawking could not move his neck, and trials showed that while he could indeed drive the chair, the movement was sporadic and jumpy.",
              "[280][292] Near the end of his life, Hawking experienced increased breathing difficulties, often resulting in his requiring the usage of a ventilator, and being regularly hospitalised.",

              "[301] on hearing this, Richard Branson offered a free flight into space with Virgin Galactic, which Hawking immediately accepted.",
              "Besides personal ambition, he was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities.",
              "[302] On 26 April 2007, Hawking flew aboard a specially-modified Boeing 727\u2013200 jet operated by Zero-G Corp off the coast of Florida to experience weightlessness.",
              "[303] Fears that the manoeuvres would cause him undue discomfort proved incorrect, and the flight was extended to eight parabolic arcs.",

              "Think what would happen if our four-dimensional world had similar curvature in space-time.",
              "If I now sent a marble off in a specific direction, it would not necessarily follow a straight path.",
              "It\u2019s path could be quite complex, depending on how complex the geometry was.",
              "We would call such a space-time non-Euclidean, and that is exactly the picture that Einstein suggested as the one for our universe.",
              "But he went further and suggested that the curvature arose from the mass or mass-energy density in our space-time(2).",
              "The larger the energy density, the more curved space-time.",
              "What this means to our ball is that as it passes by a massive object, it will be deflected towards the object due to the space-time curvature.",
              "The more massive the object, the more it will be deflected.",
              "This geometric interpretation of the force of gravity results in a description of the ball\u2019s motion that is almost the same as what Newton\u2019s law of gravity gives us.",
              "The two theories make virtually identical predictions in what we call the \u201cweak field\u201d approximation, where the force of gravity is modest.",
              "Gravitationally speaking, the environment in which we live is always within this weak field limit.",
              "That is why it took more than 200 years of observation and experimentation before there was a strong enough case to overthrow Newton\u2019s law of gravity.",
              "The places where his theory did not work had to do with such subtle effects as the rotation of Mercury\u2019s elliptical orbit around the sun and the bending of light, effects that required difficult and patient measurements.",
              "General relativity is what we use to describe the large-scale structure of our universe.",
              "It has been verified as being, if not the right model, then such a good approximation that it\u2019s failures are quite subtle indeed.",
              "It is also the framework that predicts a host of phenomena that have stretched our imagination.",
              "It predicts that if there is enough mass in one region, the force of gravity will be so strong that light itself will be unable to escape its pull, creating what we call a \u201cblack hole.",
              "\u201d It also is the framework used to determine the past history of the universe.",
              "Measurements of the velocity of very distant objects show that our universe is currently expanding rapidly.",
              "The farther away the object, the larger its recession velocity.",
              "This implies that, at some point in the past, all matter in our universe resulted from some massive initial explosion \u2013 the big bang.",
              "It is important to note that the big bang is not simply matter exploding outward to fill the universe.",
              "It is the entire universe that is exploding outward \u2013 in effect, the size of our universe is increasing.",
              "As we turn the clock back, we can see that matter and energy in our universe is getting more squished together, getting more dense, and is getting hotter.",
              "General relativity does not predict the big bang \u2013 it allows for a universe that is unchanging with time, or what we call the \u201csteady state\u201d universe.",
              "The need to invent the big bang model arises from a large body of observations (the recessional velocity of distance galaxies is just one) all pointing to the same model.",
              "The most significant shortcoming of general relativity is that we do not have a way of integrating the theory with understanding of our world at the most microscopic level.",
              "At the same time that Einstein was developing his geometric model of gravity, other physicists were discovering that energy appeared to be doled out in small but well defined chunks, or \u201cquanta.",
              "\u201d When they looked at materials that gave off light, they found that each light particle, or photon, had an energy that was some multiple of this fundamental quantum.",
              "This resulted in yet another revolution in our understanding of our world and gave birth to a new theory called \u201cquantum mechanics.",
              "\u201d It predicted that an object could be found in one of a number of distinct states, each with a unique energy, and for an object to change its quantum state, it would have to emit or absorb some number of these quanta of energy.",
              "Quantum mechanics remains the only theory that successfully describes how atoms and molecules work, and is the basis for such common-place devices as transistors and lasers.",
              "The implications of quantum mechanics are enormous, yet Einstein was never able to find a way to rationalize it with his theory of gravity(3).",
              "We were left with two physical models, one that described gravity and that had been tested at distance scales ranging from about one metre to many light-years, and the other that discussed what happened at the atomic level, but that had few manifestations at distance scales larger than about a hundredth of a micron(4).",
              "Physicists had attempted to bridge the gap between these two theories with little success until the late 1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s.",
              "Enter Stephen Hawking.",
              "He was introduced to theoretical physics at Cambridge University by his Ph.",
              "D.",
              "advisor, David Sciama, an expert in quantum theories of elementary particles and cosmology.",
              "As a graduate student in the early 1960\u2019s, he became fascinated by Einstein\u2019s theory and its implications, in part inspired by the work of a British mathematician, Roger Penrose.",
              "As would any successful scientist or problem solver, he chose to pick away at specific aspects of the theory, developing as he went a deep intuition for how the theory works.",
              "He first major exploration was into the behaviour of a funny, theoretical object called a black hole.",
              "What is a black hole?",
              "Before I can offer an answer, we first need to recall that gravity is a force that is always attractive.",
              "If one throws a bunch of matter out in space, the various pieces will not stay put.",
              "Gravity will act on each chunk of matter and attempt to draw the pieces together.",
              "As a result, any collection of objects that interact gravitationally is inherently unstable(5).",
              "Now, suppose we had a large amount of mass sitting in one place.",
              "Gravity would pull all this matter toward the centre of the mass.",
              "The more mass, the stronger the pull.",
              "At some point, the force of gravity would be so strong that it would overwhelm even photons, the particles that make up light, so that any nearby photon would be sucked in.",
              "That is what we call a black hole.",
              "In other words, a black hole is an object that has so much mass concentrated in one location that the force of gravity near the object is ineluctable.",
              "Nothing \u2013 not even light \u2013 can escape its gravitational pull.",
              "Since the black hole absorbs all light, it is completely black.",
              "The amount of mass require to create a black hole is surprisingly small on an astrophysical scale.",
              "All you need is about 3 times the mass of our sun and you have the makings of a black hole sometime in the far future.",
              "By the early 1970\u2019s, Hawking became one of the leading experts in black holes, discovering a host of properties for these strange objects.",
              "Black holes had been considered cosmic vacuum cleaners, since they suck in anything that come too close to them.",
              "There is a specific radius from the centre of the black hole, known as the \u201cevent horizon,\u201d that signifies the point of no return.",
              "Once you step inside the event horizon, you are trapped in the black hole for eternity.",
              "Hawking discovered that quantum mechanics plays a certain game right at the event horizon.",
              "It allows matter and antimatter particles to be created.",
              "Quantum mechanics plays this game all the time, usually with no real effect \u2013 a particle and its antimatter equivalent (for example, an electron and a positron, the antimatter version of an electron) will be created, survive for an extremely brief instant of time, and then will vanish, leaving things exactly the way they were before the particle-antiparticle pair was created.",
              "While the pair exists, nature plays with the law of the conservation of energy.",
              "One particle has positive energy and the other has negative energy.",
              "We would normally call such particle-antiparticle pairs as \u201cvirtual,\u201d since quantum mechanics allows these to exist for only a short time.",
              "Hawking realized that when this game takes place at the event horizon of a black hole, it is possible for the negative energy particle to be kicked across the horizon into the black hole, never to be heard from again, and for the positive energy particle to escape the black hole by being kicked in the opposite direction, in effect being a \u201creal\u201d particle.",
              "This has many consequences.",
              "A black hole is not truly black, since it can have a glow due to the particles that escape in this manner.",
              "This glow is, aptly enough, called \u201cHawking radiation.",
              "\u201d A second consequence is that since the black hole radiates energy, it could literally evaporate away!",
              "This also means that a black hole has a temperature, just like any other glowing object.",
              "Hawking along with others quickly discovered that they could even quantify the entropy, or level of disorder, of a black hole (the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the event horizon).",
              "The discovery of Hawking radiation started a flurry of theoretical work to understand all the quantum mechanical implications of black holes, and propelled Hawking to the forefront of research into gravity and quantum mechanics.",
              "His next major research topic was somewhat more ambitious.",
              "Hawking turned his attention to an even more fundamental cosmological problem by the early 1980\u2019s.",
              "Most of us have a picture of the big bang starting with an incredibly hot, dense universe filled with swarms of matter and antimatter particles.",
              "As the universe expanded and cooled, these particles begin to clump together to form the elementary particles we now see around us.",
              "Eventually, these formed into stable, neutral atoms such as hydrogen and helium.",
              "As further cooling occurred, the atoms form molecules, which aggregated into gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and other even larger scale structures.",
              "But what happened to the antimatter?",
              "For every atom of normal matter, we should be left with a corresponding antimatter equivalent, or the energy that results when the matter and antimatter annihilate each other.",
              "We see no evidence for this antimatter in our local cluster of galaxies.",
              "Where did it go?",
              "This simple notion of the big bang has other shortcomings.",
              "It doesn\u2019t tell us why our universe looks the way it does, with large clusters of galaxies separated from each other by even larger voids.",
              "It also does not tell us whether the universe will continue to expand forever, or eventually reach some maximum size and begin to contract.",
              "One possible explanation was suggested by the Soviet scientist, Andre Linde.",
              "He noted that it was conceivable that the antimatter could be converted into matter if a very unusual set of conditions arose during the very first instance after the big bang.",
              "These conditions required that the universe undergo what physicists would call a \u201cphase transition\u201d \u2013 move from one type of quantum mechanical state to a second, more stable state.",
              "In addition, this phase transition had to allow the universe to grow very rapidly (or \u201cinflate\u201d) at the same time.",
              "During this inflationary period, what is normally a subtle effect called \u201cCP-violation\u201d (CP stands for charge-parity) would cause the antimatter to convert into matter, leaving us with the matter-dominated universe we see around is today.",
              "This model, appropriately known as \u201cinflation,\u201d was in large part the brainchild of Alan Guth, a theoretical physicist who had worried about this matter-no antimatter problem.",
              "Together with a number of other cosmologists, Hawking took this idea and filled in many of the details.",
              "What ingredient in the theory ensured that the universe developed into what we see around is today?",
              "What is it in the theory that really gives us an arrow of time in this theory?",
              "What conditions had to be placed on the initial universe in order for the expansion to work out just right.",
              "The first question is considered the \u201cboundary condition problem,\u201d and it formed a conceptual and practical roadblock to making predictions with the theory.",
              "The basic problem is that quantum mechanics in principle would allow an infinite number of different universes to exist.",
              "However, if we want to ask questions about one of them \u2013 ours in this case \u2013 we have to determine what specific conditions must be obeyed in order to get our universe out of the theory.",
              "Hawking proposed that you just avoid asking this question altogether by assuming that the structure of space-time at the moment of the big bang was such that there was no \u201cpast\u201d but only future events.",
              "In effect, he and his collaborators conjectured that one did not have to worry about what was going on with the universe at a specific \u201cboundary\u201d in space-time, but that once you defined the type of universe you were in, you just had to let the universe evolve according to the laws of physics.",
              "Small, unpredictable quantum fluctuations during inflation then gave us the universe we see today.",
              "This view allowed Hawking to consider the universe as a single quantum mechanical system, a view that he has maintained in his subsequent work.",
              "Based on this, he also tackled the question of whether the arrow of time, as we understand it, always points in the same direction, even if the universe contracts.",
              "Hawking himself waffled on this philosophical issue before being able to argue persuasively that, in a well-defined sense, the arrow of time would continue to point in the same direction.",
              "The idea of inflation was completely new in the early 1980\u2019s, and it required a great deal of fine-tuning to get it to agree with what we observe in the world around us.",
              "Now, two decades later, there is still some dispute about how well it describes the world.",
              "But it has been an extremely productive theory.",
              "It has led cosmologists to ask a number of key questions and prompt the right measurements.",
              "The recent mapping of the cosmic microwave background radiation performed by the COBE satellite is an example of the sorts of observations that have been prompted by predictions made by inflation.",
              "Hawking has continued to be at the forefront of this very exciting effort.",
              "Over the last 15 years, Hawking has continued to work on the original \u201cbig problem\u201d that formed part of Einstein\u2019s legacy: How do we marry quantum mechanics and general relativity?",
              "Our observations of the world have given us few clues, mainly because gravity is such a weak force that probing it at a quantum scale has not been possible.",
              "We only have precise tests of gravity and of general relativity at the scale of about a centimeter, much larger than the atomic scale where quantum effects become important and easily observed.",
              "Actually, it is much worse than that, because we do know comes from extrapolating our ideas back to the very earliest times in the universe and asking questions such as \u201cWhat did gravity look like then?",
              "What would have been its effects?",
              "\u201d Although we do not have definitive answers, the work of Hawking and others has shown that the nature of space-time only begins to illustrate quantum effects when we get down to an extraordinarily small distance, known as the Planck scale.",
              "This scale is so small it is even hard for a cosmologist to comprehend.",
              "The size of the atom (about 10-8 m) is about 1 part in 1026 of the size of the visible universe.",
              "The Planck scale is to the atom, as the atom is to the visible universe.",
              "Hawking is currently trying to understand what the geometry of the universe looked like at the moment of the big bang.",
              "He has advocated the idea that one form of a mathematical solution to general relativity, known as the instanton, describes the state of the universe at the big bang, but that this instanton was not uniform or spherical, but shaped like a four-dimensional pea.",
              "Along with a Neil Turok, collaborator at Cambridge, he has developed this idea to show that it is compatible with his \u201cno boundary\u201d proposal.",
              "It complies with the concept of inflation to give us something like the universe we see today.",
              "These ideas are imaginative and controversial.",
              "They show that Hawking continues to be a strong influence in the search for an understanding of how our universe evolved.",
              "Stephen Hawking\u2019s relationship to the scientific community is first and foremost defined by his science, but it has also been shaped by Hawking\u2019s complex personality.",
              "Part of the problem is self-inflicted, due to his own hubris.",
              "He has been involved in several high-profile disputes with other scientist regarding priority, which are conflicts over who should be given credit for a scientific discovery.",
              "These disputes have at times been divisive, and in at least one case Hawking has had difficulty graciously admitting defeat.",
              "These have revealed a man who can be quite stubborn and unwilling to admit to error.",
              "But part of his complex relationship with other researchers is due to his public appeal as a scientist who has captured the imagination of the person on the street.",
              "I believe there is distrust and at times even contempt among some in the scientific fraternity toward attempts to reach out to the public.",
              "Some of this results from the need to water down science to present it to a non-expert.",
              "However, the importance of such outreach in communicating the excitement of the research and the possibilities the work holds far outweighs any possible distortions that can occur.",
              "Nonetheless, Hawking remains a historic figure, perhaps the most imminent physicist of his time.",
              "He also will continue to epitomize to the public the true character of the scientist struggling to understand how our world really works.",
              "The universe continues to unfold today.",
              "And what is remarkable is that its future will be uncovered by understanding our past -- a past into which Hawking has perhaps the strongest insights and vision.",
              "I strongly recommend continuing to tune in to what he says.",
              "For this remarkable mind may one day give birth to the complete history of the physical universe.",
              "(1) There are four known forces or interactions.",
              "In increasing order of strength, they are gravity, the weak force, electromagnetism and the strong force.",
              "Gravity is an attractive force between any objects with mass.",
              "The weak force, as its name suggests, is a subtle force that we find at play in the nuclei of atoms \u2013 it is responsible for most radioactivity.",
              "Electromagnetism is the force that influences objects with electric charge.",
              "The strong force is indeed the strongest of the four forces.",
              "It holds together the protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei.",
              "However, its range or the distance over which it interacts is limited to the atomic scale.",
              "(2) The identification of mass as one form of energy, E=mc2, was another consequence of Einstein\u2019s Special Theory of Relativity.",
              "(3) Einstein found the whole idea of quantum mechanics repugnant, though he realized that he could not ignore it either.",
              "The comment \u201cGod does not play with dice\u201d is widely attributed to Einstein, who found the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics to be one of its most serious defects.",
              "(4) This corresponds to about 10-5 m, or about the size of a good size molecule or a small virus.",
              "(5) There are systems that interact gravitationally that appear stable, such as our solar system.",
              "Gravity does allow some forms of motion that are dynamically stable, such as the orbit of a planet about a star.",
              "However, if you peer more closely, you will see evidence of various levels of instability \u2013 take the rings of Saturn, for example, where each ring has formed in a chaotic manner.",

              "I\u2019m glad to write about Stephen Hawking for Time because Stephen spent much of his scientific career thinking and writing about time.",
              "Time was his thing.",
              "Stephen studied time from the perspective of Einstein\u2019s theory of gravitation, the general theory of relativity.",
              "One of his early achievements was proving that time had a beginning \u2014 that the laws of physics as we now understand them must have broken down very early in the history of the universe, at the Big Bang.",
              "Stephen also greatly advanced our understanding of black holes, where gravitational forces are so strong that time comes to an end.",
              "He argued forcefully that travel backward in time is disallowed by the laws of physics, which (as he put it) \u201cmakes the world safe for historians.",
              "\u201d No one understood time better than Stephen Hawking.",
              "Stephen\u2019s greatest scientific achievement was a discovery about black holes in 1974 that shook the world of physics.",
              "According to Einstein\u2019s theory, nothing \u2014 including light \u2014 can escape from inside a black hole.",
              "That\u2019s why it\u2019s black.",
              "But Stephen found that black holes are not really completely black.",
              "Instead, due to the subtle consequences of quantum physics, they emit what we now call Hawking radiation.",
              "That insight ignited a controversy that still rages 44 years later, regarding what happens to information that falls into a black hole.",
              "If I drop my highly confidential diary into a black hole, will it be lost forever from the universe?",
              "Or will it emerge from the black hole hidden in the Hawking radiation, highly scrambled but decipherable in principle?",
              "We still don\u2019t know the answer for sure, but Hawking\u2019s breakthrough laid the foundation for much of the progress we\u2019ve made on the greatest challenge facing fundamental physics: understanding how gravitational physics and quantum physics fit together.",
              "While his scientific accomplishments alone would suffice to ensure an enduring legacy, Stephen Hawking also became one of the world\u2019s most successful popularizers of science.",

              "Stephen William Hawking (8 January 1942 \u2013 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge.",
              "[6][17][18] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.",
              "[19] Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians.",
              "In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics.",
              "In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology.",
              "In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him.",
              "[20][21] After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.",
              "[22] Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation.",
              "Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial.",
              "By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics.",
              "Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.",
              "He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.",
              "[23][24] Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general.",
              "His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.",
              "Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.",
              "In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.",
              "He died in 2018 at the age of 76, after having motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.",
              "Hawking was born on 8 January 1942[25][26] in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking (ne\u0301e Walker).",
              "[27][28] Hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland.",
              "[29][30] His wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, over-extended himself buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early 20th century.",
              "[30] His paternal great-grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in their home.",
              "[30] Despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read medicine and Isobel read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.",
              "[28] Isobel worked as a secretary for a medical research institute, and Frank was a medical researcher.",
              "[28][31] Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (1955\u20132003).",
              "[32] In 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research, the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire.",
              "[33][34] In St Albans, the family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;",
              "[33][35] meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book.",
              "[33] They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted London taxicab.",
              "[36][37] During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa,[38] the rest of the family spent four months in Mallorca visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert Graves.",
              "[39] Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate, London.",
              "He later blamed its \"progressive methods\" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.",
              "[40][33] In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months.",
              "At that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses.",
              "[39][41] Hawking attended two private (i.",
              "e. fee-paying) schools, first Radlett School[41] and from September 1952, St Albans School, Hertfordshire,[26][42] after passing the eleven-plus a year early.",
              "[43] The family placed a high value on education.",
              "[33] Hawking's father wanted his son to attend Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination.",
              "His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.",
              "[44][45] A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats,[46] and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception.",
              "[47] From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.",
              "[48][49] Although known at school as \"Einstein\", Hawking was not initially successful academically.",
              "[50] With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by Tahta, decided to read mathematics at university.",
              "[51][52][53] Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates.",
              "[54] He also wanted his son to attend University College, Oxford, his own alma mater.",
              "As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry.",
              "Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959.",
              "[55][56] Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford,[26] in October 1959 at the age of 17.",
              "[57] For the first eighteen months, he was bored and lonely \u2013 he found the academic work \"ridiculously easy\".",
              "[58][59] His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, \"It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it.\"",
              "[2] A change occurred during his second and third years when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort \"to be one of the boys\".",
              "He developed into a popular, lively and witty college-member, interested in classical music and science fiction.",
              "[57] Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat-club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing-crew.",
              "[60][61] The rowing-coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.",
              "[60][62] Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford.",
              "These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge.",
              "A first-class degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge.",
              "[63][64] Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary.",
              "[64][65] Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student.",
              "So, when asked at the viva to describe his plans, he said, \"If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge.",
              "If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First.\"",
              "[64][66] He was held in higher regard than he believed;",
              "as Berman commented, the examiners \"were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves\".",
              "[64] After receiving a first-class BA degree in physics and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.",
              "[26][67][68] Hawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult.",
              "He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned Dennis William Sciama, one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than the noted astronomer Fred Hoyle,[69][70] and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology.",
              "[71] After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, Hawking fell into a depression \u2013 though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point.",
              "[72] His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted.",
              "Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded.",
              "With Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work.",
              "[73][74] Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964.",
              "[75][76] When Hawking began his doctoral studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the Big Bang and Steady State theories.",
              "[77] Inspired by Roger Penrose's theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe;",
              "and, during 1965, he wrote his thesis on this topic.",
              "[78][79] Hawking's thesis[80] was approved in 1966.",
              "[80] There were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge;",
              "[81] he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966;",
              "[82] and his essay \"Singularities and the Geometry of Space\u2013Time\" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's prestigious Adams Prize.",
              "[83][82] In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis.",
              "This included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity.",
              "Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 Gravity Research Foundation competition.",
              "[84][85] In 1970, they published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then it must have begun as a singularity.",
              "[86][87][88] In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created Fellowship for Distinction in Science to remain at Caius.",
              "[89] In 1970, Hawking postulated what became known as the second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.",
              "[90] With James M.",
              "Bardeen and Brandon Carter, he proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics, drawing an analogy with thermodynamics.",
              "[91] To Hawking's irritation, Jacob Bekenstein, a graduate student of John Wheeler, went further\u2014and ultimately correctly\u2014to apply thermodynamic concepts literally.",
              "[92][93] In the early 1970s, Hawking's work with Carter, Werner Israel, and David C.",
              "Robinson strongly supported Wheeler's no-hair theorem, one that states that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created, it can be completely described by the properties of mass, electrical charge and rotation.",
              "[94][95] His essay titled \"Black Holes\" won the Gravity Research Foundation Award in January 1971.",
              "[96] Hawking's first book, The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time, written with George Ellis, was published in 1973.",
              "[97] Beginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics.",
              "[98][97] His work in this area was spurred by a visit to Moscow and discussions with Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Alexei Starobinsky, whose work showed that according to the uncertainty principle, rotating black holes emit particles.",
              "[99] To Hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes could never get smaller,[100] and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their entropy.",
              "[99][101] His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as Hawking radiation, which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate.",
              "[102][103][104] Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial.",
              "By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics.",
              "[105][106][107] Hawking was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974, a few weeks after the announcement of Hawking radiation.",
              "At the time, he was one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow.",
              "[108][109] Hawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Visiting Professorship at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1974.",

              "[171][172] Thorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking radiation must be \"new\", and not from inside the black hole event horizon.",
              "Since this contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten.",
              "Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way.",

              "A film version of A Brief History of Time, directed by Errol Morris and produced by Steven Spielberg, premiered in 1992.",

              "The film, while a critical success, was not widely released.",
              "[174] A popular-level collection of essays, interviews, and talks titled Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays was published in 1993,[175] and a six-part television series Stephen Hawking's Universe and a companion book appeared in 1997.",
              "As Hawking insisted, this time the focus was entirely on science.",

              "[179] Along with Thomas Hertog at CERN and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on Hawking developed a theory of top-down cosmology, which says that the universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular initial state.",
              "[180] Top-down cosmology posits that the present \"selects\" the past from a superposition of many possible histories.",
              "In doing so, the theory suggests a possible resolution of the fine-tuning question.",

              "[188] In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, he conceded his 1997 bet with Preskill, but described his own, somewhat controversial solution to the information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes have more than one topology.",
              "[189][173] In the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss.",

              "[268] Spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for him to enter his workplace, Hawking and his wife campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in Cambridge,[269][270] including adapted student housing at the university.",
              "[271] In general, Hawking had ambivalent feelings about his role as a disability rights champion: while wanting to help others, he also sought to detach himself from his illness and its challenges.",
              "[272] His lack of engagement in this area led to some criticism.",
              "[273] During a visit to CERN on the border of France and Switzerland in mid-1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia, which in his condition was life-threatening;",
              "he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated.",
              "She refused, but the consequence was a tracheotomy, which required round-the-clock nursing care and caused the loss of what remained of his speech.",

              "One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.",
              "[278] For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose letters on a spelling card,[279] but in 1986 he received a computer program called the \"Equalizer\" from Walter Woltosz, CEO of Words Plus, who had developed an earlier version of the software to help his mother-in-law, who also had ALS and had lost her ability to speak and write.",
              "[280] In a method he used for the rest of his life, Hawking could now simply press a switch to select phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2,500\u20133,000 that were scanned.",

              "[284] The voice he used had an American accent and is no longer produced.",
              "[285][286] Despite the later availability of other voices, Hawking retained this original voice, saying that he preferred it and identified with it.",
              "[287] Originally, Hawking activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to 15 words per minute.",
              "[151] Lectures were prepared in advance and were sent to the speech synthesiser in short sections to be delivered.",
              "[285] Hawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles,[288][289][290] with a rate of about one word per minute.",
              "[289] With this decline there was a risk of him developing locked-in syndrome, so Hawking collaborated with Intel Corporation researchers on systems that could translate his brain patterns or facial expressions into switch activations.",
              "After several prototypes that did not perform as planned, they settled on an adaptive word predictor made by the London-based startup SwiftKey, which used a system similar to his original technology.",
              "Hawking had an easier time adapting to the new system, which was further developed after inputting large amounts of Hawking's papers and other written materials and uses predictive software similar to other smartphone keyboards.",
              "[181][280][290][291] By 2009, he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently, but the same people who created his new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his chair using movements made by his chin.",
              "This proved difficult, since Hawking could not move his neck, and trials showed that while he could indeed drive the chair, the movement was sporadic and jumpy.",
              "[280][292] Near the end of his life, Hawking experienced increased breathing difficulties, often resulting in his requiring the usage of a ventilator, and being regularly hospitalised.",

              "[299] In August 2014, Hawking accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge to promote ALS/MND awareness and raise contributions for research.",
              "As he had pneumonia in 2013, he was advised not to have ice poured over him, but his children volunteered to accept the challenge on his behalf.",
              "[300] In late 2006, Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space;",
              "[301] on hearing this, Richard Branson offered a free flight into space with Virgin Galactic, which Hawking immediately accepted.",
              "Besides personal ambition, he was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities.",
              "[302] On 26 April 2007, Hawking flew aboard a specially-modified Boeing 727\u2013200 jet operated by Zero-G Corp off the coast of Florida to experience weightlessness.",
              "[303] Fears that the manoeuvres would cause him undue discomfort proved incorrect, and the flight was extended to eight parabolic arcs.",
              "[301] It was described as a successful test to see if he could withstand the g-forces involved in space flight.",
              "[304] At the time, the date of Hawking's trip to space was projected to be as early as 2009, but commercial flights to space did not commence before his death.",

              "He ranked no more than halfway up in his school class, though he now says, in his defense, \"It was a very bright class.\"",
              "Maybe someone might have predicted a career in science or engineering from the fact that Stephen was intensely interested in learning the secrets of how things such as clocks and radios work.",
              "He took them apart to find out, but he could seldom reassemble them.",
              "Stephen was never well-coordinated physically, not keen on sports or other physical activities, and almost always the last to be chosen for any sports team.",

              "By the mid-1970s, the Hawking family had taken in one of Hawking's graduate students to help manage his care and work.",
              "He could still feed himself and get out of bed, but virtually everything else required assistance.",
              "In addition, his speech had become increasingly slurred, so that only those who knew him well could understand him.",
              "In 1985 he lost his voice for good following a tracheotomy.",
              "The resulting situation required 24-hour nursing care for the acclaimed physicist.",

              "In April, Hawking, who had already announced he was retiring after 30 years from the post of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, was rushed to the hospital for being what university officials described as \"gravely ill,\" though he later made a full recovery.",
              "In 1974, Hawking's research turned him into a celebrity within the scientific world when he showed that black holes aren't the information vacuums that scientists had thought they were.",
              "In simple terms, Hawking demonstrated that matter, in the form of radiation, can escape the gravitational force of a collapsed star.",
              "Another young cosmologist, Roger Penrose, had earlier discovered groundbreaking findings about the fate of stars and the creation of black holes, which tapped into Hawking's own fascination with how the universe began.",

              "Stephen William Hawking (8 January 1942 \u2013 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge.",
              "[6][17][18] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.",
              "[19] Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians.",
              "In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics.",
              "In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology.",
              "In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him.",
              "[20][21] After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.",
              "[22] Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation.",
              "Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial.",
              "By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics.",
              "Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.",
              "He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.",
              "[23][24] Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general.",
              "His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.",
              "Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.",
              "In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.",
              "He died in 2018 at the age of 76, after having motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.",
              "Hawking was born on 8 January 1942[25][26] in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking (ne\u0301e Walker).",
              "[27][28] Hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland.",
              "[29][30] His wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, over-extended himself buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early 20th century.",
              "[30] His paternal great-grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in their home.",
              "[30] Despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read medicine and Isobel read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.",
              "[28] Isobel worked as a secretary for a medical research institute, and Frank was a medical researcher.",
              "[28][31] Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (1955\u20132003).",
              "[32] In 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research, the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire.",
              "[33][34] In St Albans, the family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;",
              "[33][35] meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book.",
              "[33] They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted London taxicab.",
              "[36][37] During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa,[38] the rest of the family spent four months in Mallorca visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert Graves.",
              "[39] Hawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate, London.",
              "He later blamed its \"progressive methods\" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.",
              "[40][33] In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months.",
              "At that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses.",
              "[39][41] Hawking attended two private (i.",
              "e. fee-paying) schools, first Radlett School[41] and from September 1952, St Albans School, Hertfordshire,[26][42] after passing the eleven-plus a year early.",
              "[43] The family placed a high value on education.",
              "[33] Hawking's father wanted his son to attend Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination.",
              "His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.",
              "[44][45] A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats,[46] and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception.",
              "[47] From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.",
              "[48][49] Although known at school as \"Einstein\", Hawking was not initially successful academically.",
              "[50] With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by Tahta, decided to read mathematics at university.",
              "[51][52][53] Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates.",
              "[54] He also wanted his son to attend University College, Oxford, his own alma mater.",
              "As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry.",
              "Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959.",
              "[55][56] Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford,[26] in October 1959 at the age of 17.",
              "[57] For the first eighteen months, he was bored and lonely \u2013 he found the academic work \"ridiculously easy\".",
              "[58][59] His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, \"It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it.\"",
              "[2] A change occurred during his second and third years when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort \"to be one of the boys\".",
              "He developed into a popular, lively and witty college-member, interested in classical music and science fiction.",
              "[57] Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat-club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing-crew.",
              "[60][61] The rowing-coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.",
              "[60][62] Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford.",
              "These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge.",
              "A first-class degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge.",
              "[63][64] Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary.",
              "[64][65] Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student.",
              "So, when asked at the viva to describe his plans, he said, \"If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge.",
              "If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First.\"",
              "[64][66] He was held in higher regard than he believed;",
              "as Berman commented, the examiners \"were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves\".",
              "[64] After receiving a first-class BA degree in physics and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.",
              "[26][67][68] Hawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult.",
              "He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned Dennis William Sciama, one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than the noted astronomer Fred Hoyle,[69][70] and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology.",
              "[71] After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, Hawking fell into a depression \u2013 though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point.",
              "[72] His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted.",
              "Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded.",
              "With Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work.",
              "[73][74] Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964.",
              "[75][76] When Hawking began his doctoral studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the Big Bang and Steady State theories.",
              "[77] Inspired by Roger Penrose's theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe;",
              "and, during 1965, he wrote his thesis on this topic.",
              "[78][79] Hawking's thesis[80] was approved in 1966.",
              "[80] There were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge;",
              "[81] he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966;",
              "[82] and his essay \"Singularities and the Geometry of Space\u2013Time\" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's prestigious Adams Prize.",
              "[83][82] In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis.",

              "[189][173] In the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss.",

              "[21] Hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing.",
              "[250][251] The problems worsened, and his speech became slightly slurred.",
              "His family noticed the changes when he returned home for Christmas, and medical investigations were begun.",
              "[252][253] The MND diagnosis came when Hawking was 21, in 1963.",
              "At the time, doctors gave him a life expectancy of two years.",
              "[254][255] In the late 1960s, Hawking's physical abilities declined: he began to use crutches and could no longer give lectures regularly.",
              "[256] As he slowly lost the ability to write, he developed compensatory visual methods, including seeing equations in terms of geometry.",
              "[257][258] The physicist Werner Israel later compared the achievements to Mozart composing an entire symphony in his head.",
              "[259][260] Hawking was fiercely independent and unwilling to accept help or make concessions for his disabilities.",
              "He preferred to be regarded as \"a scientist first, popular science writer second, and, in all the ways that matter, a normal human being with the same desires, drives, dreams, and ambitions as the next person.\"",
              "[261] His wife Jane later noted: \"Some people would call it determination, some obstinacy.",
              "I've called it both at one time or another.\"",
              "[262] He required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the end of the 1960s,[263] but ultimately became notorious for the wildness of his wheelchair driving.",
              "[264] Hawking was a popular and witty colleague, but his illness, as well as his reputation for brashness, distanced him from some.",
              "[262] When Hawking first began using a wheelchair he was using standard motorised models.",
              "The earliest surviving example of these chairs was made by BEC Mobility and sold by Christie's in November 2018 for \u00a3296,750.",
              "[265] Hawking continued to use this type of chair until the early 1990s, at which time his ability to use his hands to drive a wheelchair deteriorated.",
              "Hawking used a variety of different chairs from that time, including a DragonMobility Dragon elevating powerchair from 2007, as shown in the April 2008 photo of Hawking attending NASA's 50th anniversary;",

              "To communicate with others, someone who knew him well would interpret his speech into intelligible speech.",
              "[268] Spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for him to enter his workplace, Hawking and his wife campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in Cambridge,[269][270] including adapted student housing at the university.",
              "[271] In general, Hawking had ambivalent feelings about his role as a disability rights champion: while wanting to help others, he also sought to detach himself from his illness and its challenges.",
              "[272] His lack of engagement in this area led to some criticism.",
              "[273] During a visit to CERN on the border of France and Switzerland in mid-1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia, which in his condition was life-threatening;",
              "he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated.",
              "She refused, but the consequence was a tracheotomy, which required round-the-clock nursing care and caused the loss of what remained of his speech.",
              "[274][275] The National Health Service was ready to pay for a nursing home, but Jane was determined that he would live at home.",
              "The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation.",

              "One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.",
              "[278] For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose letters on a spelling card,[279] but in 1986 he received a computer program called the \"Equalizer\" from Walter Woltosz, CEO of Words Plus, who had developed an earlier version of the software to help his mother-in-law, who also had ALS and had lost her ability to speak and write.",
              "[280] In a method he used for the rest of his life, Hawking could now simply press a switch to select phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2,500\u20133,000 that were scanned.",
              "[281][282] The program was originally run on a desktop computer.",
              "Elaine Mason's husband, David, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and attached it to his wheelchair.",
              "[283] Released from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech, Hawking commented that \"I can communicate better now than before I lost my voice.\"",
              "[284] The voice he used had an American accent and is no longer produced.",
              "[285][286] Despite the later availability of other voices, Hawking retained this original voice, saying that he preferred it and identified with it.",
              "[287] Originally, Hawking activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to 15 words per minute.",
              "[151] Lectures were prepared in advance and were sent to the speech synthesiser in short sections to be delivered.",
              "[285] Hawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles,[288][289][290] with a rate of about one word per minute.",
              "[289] With this decline there was a risk of him developing locked-in syndrome, so Hawking collaborated with Intel Corporation researchers on systems that could translate his brain patterns or facial expressions into switch activations.",
              "After several prototypes that did not perform as planned, they settled on an adaptive word predictor made by the London-based startup SwiftKey, which used a system similar to his original technology.",
              "Hawking had an easier time adapting to the new system, which was further developed after inputting large amounts of Hawking's papers and other written materials and uses predictive software similar to other smartphone keyboards.",
              "[181][280][290][291] By 2009, he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently, but the same people who created his new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his chair using movements made by his chin.",
              "This proved difficult, since Hawking could not move his neck, and trials showed that while he could indeed drive the chair, the movement was sporadic and jumpy.",
              "[280][292] Near the end of his life, Hawking experienced increased breathing difficulties, often resulting in his requiring the usage of a ventilator, and being regularly hospitalised.",
              "[181] Starting in the 1990s, Hawking accepted the mantle of role model for disabled people, lecturing and participating in fundraising activities.",
              "[293] At the turn of the century, he and eleven other humanitarians signed the Charter for the Third Millennium on Disability, which called on governments to prevent disability and protect the rights of disabled people.",
              "[294][295] In 1999, Hawking was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society.",
              "[296] In August 2012, Hawking narrated the \"Enlightenment\" segment of the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London.",
              "[297] In 2013, the biographical documentary film Hawking, in which Hawking himself is featured, was released.",
              "[298] In September 2013, he expressed support for the legalisation of assisted suicide for the terminally ill.",
              "[299] In August 2014, Hawking accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge to promote ALS/MND awareness and raise contributions for research.",
              "As he had pneumonia in 2013, he was advised not to have ice poured over him, but his children volunteered to accept the challenge on his behalf.",
              "[300] In late 2006, Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space;",
              "[301] on hearing this, Richard Branson offered a free flight into space with Virgin Galactic, which Hawking immediately accepted.",
              "Besides personal ambition, he was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities.",
              "[302] On 26 April 2007, Hawking flew aboard a specially-modified Boeing 727\u2013200 jet operated by Zero-G Corp off the coast of Florida to experience weightlessness.",
              "[303] Fears that the manoeuvres would cause him undue discomfort proved incorrect, and the flight was extended to eight parabolic arcs.",
              "[301] It was described as a successful test to see if he could withstand the g-forces involved in space flight.",
              "[304] At the time, the date of Hawking's trip to space was projected to be as early as 2009, but commercial flights to space did not commence before his death.",
              "[305] Hawking died at his home in Cambridge on 14 March 2018, at the age of 76.",
              "[306][307][308] His family stated that he \"died peacefully\".",

              "The world lost one of its most brilliant scientific minds Wednesday, when legendary physicist Stephen Hawking died at age 76.",
              "Hawking\u2019s cause of death was likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that wears away at nerve and muscle function over time.",
              "He was first diagnosed with ALS more than five decades ago, at age 21, and was initially given just a few years to live \u2014 making the very nature of his long, illustrious career as much of a scientific marvel as the theories and discoveries it yielded.",
              "Here\u2019s what to know about ALS, and what may have allowed Hawking to beat the odds for so long.",
              "ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that erodes motor neurons \u2014 cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscular function \u2014 until it becomes difficult or impossible for a person to walk, talk, speak, swallow and breathe, according to the ALS Association.",
              "ALS symptoms often begin with slurred speech or muscle weakness and twitching, according to the Mayo Clinic, and get worse over time.",
              "The rate at which a person\u2019s condition degrades can vary quite a bit, though the average survival time is three years after diagnosis, the ALS Association says.",
              "While there\u2019s no cure for ALS, the condition can be managed with medication, physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy.",
              "Some patients also use ventilators to assist with breathing.",
              "Doctors aren\u2019t totally sure what causes ALS in most cases, though it does appear to have a genetic component in some people, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
              "It\u2019s usually diagnosed in people between ages 40 and 60, and men seem to be more likely than women to develop the condition, at least before the age of 65, the Mayo Clinic says.",
              "Quite rare.",
              "Just 5% of ALS patients live longer than 20 years, according to the ALS Association, and it\u2019s virtually unheard of to survive for 50 years or more \u2014 though North America\u2019s longest-living ALS patient, a Canadian named Steven Wells, has had the condition for almost 40 years.",
              "\u201cThis is fairly untypical,\u201d says Lucie Bruijn, the ALS Association\u2019s chief scientist, adding that she is not aware of anyone who has survived ALS longer than Hawking did.",
              "Hawking was also able to evade the dementia that some people with ALS experience toward the later phases of the disease, she says.",
              "Researchers aren\u2019t sure, Bruijn says.",
              "\u201cALS is a complex disorder, and every journey is so incredibly variable,\u201d she says.",
              "\u201cWe are working with teams globally on these very big data efforts, trying to understand each person\u2019s clinical journey, what their genetics look like and what they were exposed to.",
              "\u201d From that, she says, they\u2019re \u201ctrying to figure out the puzzle.",
              "\u201d With only a few cases of extreme longevity on record, Bruijn says the sample size is too small to draw concrete conclusions about the factors that allow people like Hawking and Wells to live so long, though it\u2019s probably some combination of genes, environment and clinical care.",
              "The kind of motor neurons affected by a person\u2019s disease may also matter, Bruijn says, noting that motor neurons that control eye movement often resist ALS far longer than those in the brain and spinal cord.",
              "Understanding how those cells stave off death may help scientists understand long-term survival, she says.",
              "\u201cWhat is different about those motor neurons compared to those in the spinal cord and brain?",
              "\u201d Bruijn asks.",

              "It appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons.",
              "However, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons.",
              "There is also primary lateral sclerosis\u2014PLS\u2014and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder.",
              "However, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder.",
              "The other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy\u2014or progressive supranuclear palsy\u2014which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles.",
              "But it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles.",
              "Those are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described.",
              "And it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons.",
              "It's now clear that that's not true.",
              "It's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe.",
              "So some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia.",
              "One of the misconceptions about ALS is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true.",
              "What has Stephen Hawking's case shown about the disease?",
              "One thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways.",
              "On average people live two to three years after diagnosis.",
              "But that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time.",
              "Life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm\u2014the breathing muscles.",
              "So the common way people die is of respiratory failure.",
              "And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration.",

              "Juvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and I don't know enough about his course to say.",
              "But it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly.",
              "I have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s.",
              "But not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say.",
              "He's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur.",
              "How frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS?",
              "I would say probably less than a few percent.",
              "How much do you think Stephen Hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of ALS?",
              "It's probably a little bit of both.",
              "I just know him from television, so I don't know what kind of interventions he's had.",
              "If he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology\u2014it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live.",
              "For trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table.",
              "But mostly it's about the biology of the disease.",
              "Hawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition.",
              "Is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes?",
              "Or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference?",
              "I don't believe that adds to longevity.",

              "Beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, ALS was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain.",
              "Ten percent of ALS is genetic and based on a gene mutation.",
              "I'm sure there are also at-risk genes for ALS, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease.",
              "Each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain.",
              "Knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies.",
              "But none of this has given us any robust therapies yet.",

              "Hawking, who died this week at age 76, may have lived longer with ALS than any patient in history.",
              "Here's what we know about the disease, and his case in particular.",
              "BuzzFeed News Reporter Rare and often fatal, it\u2019s also called Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease after the famed baseball player who was diagnosed with it in 1939, and ultimately died of the disease.",
              "In the UK, where Hawking was born, it\u2019s called motor neurone disease (MND).",
              "ALS attacks the nerves that carry impulses from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles throughout your body, causing them to degenerate and die.",
              "This affects the ability of these muscles to perform the voluntary movements needed for walking, talking, chewing, lifting objects, and more.",
              "When the muscles no longer receive the messages to move, they begin to weaken, twitch, and waste away (atrophy), according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).",
              "\"The disease robs the whole body of all active movements we make to do daily tasks,\" Lucie Bruijn, chief scientist at the ALS Association, told BuzzFeed News.",
              "In some cases there may also be cognitive impairment or dementia, Bruijn said, but many people with ALS (like Hawking) do not have changes in their ability to think.",
              "Most people who get ALS are between the ages of 40 and 70, and it can affect anyone regardless of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.",
              "Doctors do not know what causes ALS and there is currently no cure, although some treatments and technologies may help manage symptoms. The prognosis for ALS is not a good one, but there are some cases where people defy the odds, such as Hawking.",
              "About 10% of people will survive for 10 or more years.",
              "But the disease can also kill within months.",
              "\"The changes in ability to move progress faster for some than others, it's very variable,\" Bruijn said.",
              "Progression isn't always linear, either.",
              "\"There are various stages of the disease, and some people progress quickly then maintain at that stage and later progress again,\" Bruijn said.",
              "However, it is very rare for there to be any improvement or to recover lost functions.",
              "A person with ALS might die for a variety of reasons, but it's often from breathing problems due to the disease.",
              "\"People usually succumb to not being able to breathe because the lungs depend on the diaphragm (a muscle) and its ability to contract and relax,\" Bruijn said.",
              "The breathing problems caused by ALS can lead to exhaustion, infections like pneumonia, and respiratory failure.",
              "\"Artificial breathing support and other technologies can really extend someone's ability to live longer,\" Bruijn said.",
              "In Hawking's case, he was diagnosed in 1963 at age 21 and defied the odds to live for another 55 years until the age of 76.",
              "Hawking lived his entire adult life with the disease, and unlike those patients who experience cognitive impairment or dementia, Hawking continued to work as an astrophysicist and make major contributions to the study of black holes and space.",
              "\"He progressed to the point where he was unable to move or speak, but he used things like eye movement and other technologies to speak so he was mentally extremely active \u2014 he had a remarkably long, and in some ways healthy battle,\" Bruijn said.",
              "It is estimated that only 5% of people with ALS will live 20 years or longer.",
              "Hawking may have lived longer than any patient in history after an ALS diagnosis.",
              "So why did Hawking's case progress more slowly than others?",
              "There isn't a clear answer.",
              "\"We do not know exactly why he lived for so long and every individual's journey is different, but genes and environment play a role in the progression of the disease,\" Bruijn said.",
              "In addition to the possible genetic and environmental factors that could've allowed Hawking to live longer, he had remarkable access to care and advanced technology.",
              "\"If you get assistance to move and speak, the quality of life will improve \u2014 the fact that he could continue to work is a huge aspect of mental health,\" Bruijn said.",
              "That being said, many patients with ALS will continue to decline regardless of any treatment or technology.",
              "\"It's a very complex disease and his slow progression and long life just reflects the fact that it's very variable,\" Bruijn said.",
              "However, Hawking was likely an exception to the rule.",
              "It is unclear which type of ALS Hawking had, and whether this was a factor.",
              "\"Many people with ALS have looked to Hawking and gotten strength from his journey \u2014 it's important to respect and honor what he represented to the ALS community,\" Bruijn said.",
              "Hawking was also a major contributor to ALS research and supported initiatives to better understand the disease.",
              "\u201cStephen Hawking has inspired me to focus on what I can do, rather than what my body can no longer do,\u201d Stephen Winthrop, the ALS Association board of trustees chair, wrote of Hawking in a press release.",
              "Attention for this rare disease skyrocketed with the Ice Bucket Challenge in the summer of 2014, which raised $115 million for ALS research projects.",

              "Stephen Hawking had a fundamental understanding of not just the universe itself, but of people.",
              "A time-traveler themed party sounds like the B plot in a Big Bang Theory episode, but Hawking knew that the hook alone \u2014 that a party for time travelers where none showed up \u2014 would prove his point beyond any scientific paper published in a stuffy journal.",

              "Indeed, despite being handed a grim outlook in his early 20s, Hawking never lost his ability to laugh at himself and others, and it was his wicked sense of humor that came through in books, interviews and TV appearances and helped transform him into an unlikely pop culture icon.",
              "Here's a list of 10 of his best jokes, along with the poor saps who found themselves at the receiving end of a cosmic burn.",

              "Appearing via hologram for a talk at the Sydney Opera House in April 2015, Hawking was asked about the \"cosmological effect\" of Zayn Malik departing One Direction and leaving a trail of distraught teenage girls in his wake.",
              "\"Finally, a question about something important,\" replied the good doctor.",
              "\"My advice to any heartbroken young girl is to pay close attention to the study of theoretical physics.",

              "In June 2014, Hawking joined John Oliver for the debut of the \"People Who Think Good\" interview series on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.",
              "The entire segment is well worth watching, but the highlight came when Oliver asked, \"You've stated that you believe there could be an infinite number of parallel universes.",
              "Does that mean that there is a universe out there where I am smarter than you?\"",
              "\"Yes,\" replied Hawking.",
              "\"And also a universe where you're funny.\"",
              "Speaking of his writing, in 2004 The New York Times asked: \"With all your intense erudition, why do you bother writing pop-science books about the universe?\"",
              "Hawking: \"I want my books sold on airport bookstalls.\"",
              "Prior to the February 2015 Academy Awards, for which his biopic The Theory of Everything had garnered numerous nominations, Hawking said he was happy to let leading man Eddie Redmayne use his signature computerized voice box for the film.",

              "The anxious visitors rushed over to find Hawking very much alive and giddy at his joke \u2013 the alarm was simply over the office computer losing its power supply.",
              "In his 1993 book, In Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays, Hawking offered a compelling argument against the notion of destiny: \"I have noticed that even people who claim everything is predetermined and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road.\"",

              "He also got it together when it counted, dominating his Oxford entrance exams to score a scholarship to study physics at age 17.",
              "After falling while ice skating during his first year as a grad student at Cambridge University, Hawking was told he had the degenerative motor neuron disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and had only two-and-a-half years to live.",
              "Obviously that prognosis was light years off, but it seems early onset of the disease was a blessing in disguise, of sorts.",
              "Most ALS patients are diagnosed in their mid-50s and live another two to five years, but those diagnosed earlier tend to have a slower-progressing form of the disease.",

              "Hawking was initially puzzled by these findings, as he believed black holes to be celestial death traps that swallowed up all energy.",
              "However, he determined there was room for this phenomenon through the merging of quantum theory, general relativity and thermodynamics, distilling it all into one (relatively) simple but elegant formula in 1974.",
              "Already known for establishing important ground rules about the properties of black holes, this discovery kicked his career into a higher gear and set him on the path to stardom.",
              "Hawking later said he would like this equation to be carved on his tombstone.",
              "Although the doomsday predictions of his early doctors were off, Hawking did almost die after contracting pneumonia while traveling to Geneva in 1985.",
              "While he was unconscious and hooked up to a ventilator, the option of removing the fragile scientist from life support was being considered until his then-wife, Jane, rejected the idea.",
              "Hawking instead underwent a tracheotomy, an operation that helped him breathe but permanently took away his ability to speak, prompting the creation of his famous speech synthesizer.",
              "Hawking's original synthesizer was created by a California-based company called Words Plus, which ran a speech program called Equalizer on an Apple II computer.",
              "Adapted to a portable system that could be mounted on a wheelchair, the program enabled Hawking to \"speak\" by using a hand clicker to choose words on a screen.",
              "After he eventually lost use of his hands, Hawking had an infrared switch mounted on his glasses that generated words by detecting cheek movement.",
              "He also had the communication technology overhauled by Intel, though he insisted on retaining the same robotic voice with its distinctly non-British accent he'd been using for three decades, as he considered it an indelible part of his identity.",
              "Hawking long believed he could write a book about the mysteries of the universe that would connect with the public, a task that seemed all but impossible after he lost the abilities to write and speak.",
              "However, he painstakingly pressed forward with his speech synthesizer, receiving valuable assistance from students who relayed draft revisions with his editor in the United States via speakerphone.",
              "Hawking's vision ultimately was realized, as A Brief History of Time landed on the London Sunday Times best-seller list for 237 weeks after its publication in 1988.",

              "Here\u2019s how it works.",
              "Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking died peacefully today (March 14) at age 76 at his home in Cambridge, England.",
              "Hawking will be remembered by many as a cultural force \u2014 the brilliant thinker who wrote \"A Brief History of Time\" and played himself on \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" \"The Simpsons\" and \"The Big Bang Theory.\"",
              "He published more than 10 popular books (including a series of children's books, co-written with his daughter, Lucy) and was the subject of more than 15 documentary films and biopics.",
              "He once threw a party for time travelers (which nobody attended).",
              "He did it all while living with the incurable degenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which put him in a wheelchair for much of his life.",
              "But beyond his inspirational biography and pop-culture bona fides, Hawking will also be remembered as perhaps the most important physicist of the second half of the 20th century.",
              "Hawking's work on black holes, quantum mechanics and the origins of the universe advanced the theories of previous thinkers like Albert Einstein and Werner Heisenberg, providing the most comprehensive explanation for the behavior of the cosmos to date.",
              "\"My goal is simple,\" Hawking was quoted as saying in a 1989 biography.",
              "\"It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all.\"",
              "[Stephen Hawking's Most Intriguing Quotes on Humanity, Aliens and Women] Here, we recall some of Hawking's biggest theories about life, the universe and everything.",
              "Hawking began sharing his vision of the universe in 1966 while studying physics at the University of Cambridge, when he turned in a doctoral thesis on the origin of the universe.",
              "At the time, scientists understood the universe to be expanding, though they did not know why.",
              "Hawking proposed the first description of what we now know as the Big Bang: somewhere, at the earliest edges of time, the universe began as a single point of infinitely small, massively dense space-time \u2014 a \"singularity,\" as Hawking described it.",
              "From this single point, our entire expanding universe burst forth, bringing with it all the laws of time and physics we understand today, Hawking said.",
              "Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.",
              "\"There is a singularity in our past, which constitutes, in some sense, a beginning to the universe,\" Hawking eventually wrote in the preface of his first book, \"The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time\" (1973).",
              "Over the years following his graduation from the University of Cambridge, Hawking attempted to describe that universal starting point mathematically.",
              "By applying a complex model inspired by Einstein's theory of general relativity, Hawking and his colleague Roger Penrose created the first of several singularity theorems, which described the cosmological conditions required for a singularity in space-time to exist.",
              "Hawking had a fascination with the places where physics seemingly broke down.",
              "This included, famously, his study of black holes \u2014 stars that have collapsed into themselves, creating a vortex so gravitationally intense that not even light can escape them.",
              "While working at the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge, Hawking began studying black holes through the lens of thermodynamics.",
              "In 1973, he published (along with several colleagues) a paper detailing the four laws of black hole mechanics, describing the warped physics of the mysterious celestial bodies through a series of complex equations.",
              "Hawking continued studying black holes and, soon after, had the eureka moment for which he is best known.",
              "At the time, it was thought that nothing could escape the strong gravitational pull of black holes.",
              "In 1974, Hawking showed that, under certain conditions, black holes actually could create and emit subatomic particles, eventually dissolving and finally exploding in an intense burst of energy.",
              "In other words: Black holes were not completely black after all.",
              "This stream of energy radiated by black holes was later named Hawking radiation, after he described it in a 1974 paper titled \"Black Hole Explosions?\"",
              "The discovery of Hawking radiation changed the way researchers understand the universe.",
              "By attempting to knit together the laws of gravity, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and relativity, the study of black hole radiation also pointed to the existence of a so-called \"theory of everything\" \u2014 a single, unified theory of physics that described the behavior of the universe.",
              "\"Black hole radiation raises serious puzzles we are still working very hard to understand,\" Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology, told New Scientist.",
              "\"It's fair to say that Hawking radiation is the single biggest clue we have to the ultimate reconciliation of quantum mechanics and gravity, arguably the greatest challenge facing theoretical physics today.\"",
              "Hawking continued publishing papers for the following four and a half decades, but became most famous in his later career as a science communicator.",
              "He has drawn attention lately for his concerns about humanity's future in regards to artificial intelligence, his vocal opposition of wars and his insistence that leaders like U.",
              "S.",
              "President Donald Trump take the threats of climate change more seriously.",
              "A few weeks ago, he told celebrity physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson his theory about what happened before the Big Bang.",
              "Still, Hawking's most lasting quotes may be about the importance of communication itself.",
              "\"Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking, and its greatest failures by not talking,\" Hawking said.",
              "\"It doesn't have to be like this.",
              "Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future.",
              "With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded.",

          "Stephen Hawking found that black holes are not really completely black.",
          "He proposed that black holes would emit subatomic particles until they eventually exploded.",
          "Instead, due to the subtle consequences of quantum physics, they emit what we now call Hawking radiation.",
          "In 1974 Hawking proposed that, in accordance with the predictions of quantum theory, black holes emit subatomic particles until they exhaust their energy and finally explode.",
          "Stephen\u2019s greatest scientific achievement was a discovery about black holes in 1974 that shook the world of physics.",
          "He has advocated the idea that one form of a mathematical solution to general relativity, known as the instanton, describes the state of the universe at the big bang, but that this instanton was not uniform or spherical, but shaped like a four-dimensional pea."

          "Hawking\u2019s cause of death was likely amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that wears away at nerve and muscle function over time.",
          "He was first diagnosed with ALS more than five decades ago, at age 21, and was initially given just a few years to live \u2014 making the very nature of his long, illustrious career as much of a scientific marvel as the theories and discoveries it yielded.",

          "\"The only advantage of my disability is that I do not get put on a lot of boring committees,\" he said.",
          "During a trip to Jerusalem in December 2006, Hawking spoke of the pros and cons of his physical limitations.",
          "You can be incomprehensibly intelligent but still play practical jokes \u2014 Hawking was well known to run over the feet of people he didn\u2019t like with his wheelchair.",
          "Indeed, despite being handed a grim outlook in his early 20s, Hawking never lost his ability to laugh at himself and others, and it was his wicked sense of humor that came through in books, interviews and TV appearances and helped transform him into an unlikely pop culture icon.",
          "Hawking took the image \u2014 and the message behind it, that life and indeed oneself perhaps shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously \u2014 and rolled with it his whole life."
