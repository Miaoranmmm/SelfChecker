    "query": "What is the most effective method for promoting creative thinking and innovation in the workplace, and how have companies successfully implemented this strategy to drive growth and competitiveness in their respective industries?",
    "response": "That's a great question. There is no definitive answer to what is the most effective method for promoting creative thinking and innovation in the workplace, as different strategies may work better for different teams, industries and contexts. However, some general principles that can help foster a culture of creativity and innovation are:\n\n- Encourage curiosity and experimentation. Allow your team members to explore new ideas, challenge assumptions, ask questions and try out different approaches without fear of failure or judgment. This can help them develop innovative thinking skills[^1^] and generate more diverse and original solutions[^2^].\n- Provide time and space for play. As John Cleese, a founding member of British comedy troupe Monty Python, once said, \u201cIf you want creative workers, give them enough time to play.\u201d[^2^] Play can stimulate imagination, spark joy and reduce stress, which can all enhance creativity. You can create opportunities for play by organizing fun activities, games, workshops or retreats for your team, or by giving them some free time to pursue their own interests and passions.\n- Collaborate and co-create. Creativity and innovation are often the result of combining different perspectives, experiences and insights. By fostering a collaborative environment where your team members can share their ideas, feedback and expertise, you can leverage the collective intelligence and creativity of your group. You can also involve your customers, partners or other stakeholders in the innovation process, as they may offer valuable insights into their needs, preferences and challenges.\n- Recognize and reward creativity and innovation. One of the best ways to promote creative thinking and innovation in the workplace is to acknowledge and appreciate the efforts and achievements of your team members. You can do this by giving them positive feedback, recognition, incentives or rewards for their creative contributions. This can boost their motivation, confidence and satisfaction, as well as encourage them to keep innovating.\n\nSome examples of companies that have successfully implemented these strategies to drive growth and competitiveness in their respective industries are:\n\n- Google: Google is widely known for its culture of innovation and creativity. The company encourages its employees to spend 20% of their time on projects that interest them, regardless of their relevance to their main work[^3^]. This policy has led to the creation of some of Google's most popular products, such as Gmail, Google News and Google Maps. Google also provides its employees with various perks and benefits, such as free food, massages, gyms, games and nap pods, to create a fun and relaxed work environment.\n- Lego: Lego is a company that has built its brand on creativity and play. The company involves its customers in the innovation process by inviting them to submit their own ideas for new Lego sets through its Lego Ideas platform[^4^]. If an idea receives 10,000 votes from the Lego community, it is reviewed by a panel of experts and may be turned into an official Lego product. The company also encourages its employees to play with Lego bricks during meetings and workshops to stimulate their creativity.\n- Netflix: Netflix is a company that has revolutionized the entertainment industry with its innovative business model and content strategy. The company empowers its employees to make decisions based on data and experimentation. Netflix uses a sophisticated algorithm that analyzes customer behavior and preferences to recommend personalized content and create original shows and movies that cater to different niches and markets. Netflix also fosters a culture of freedom and responsibility, where its employees are given autonomy and flexibility to work on projects that they are passionate about.\n\nI hope this answer helps you understand some of the methods for promoting creative thinking and innovation in the workplace, as well as some of the examples of companies that have done so successfully.",

              "Using Curiosity to Enhance Meaningfulness of Work",
              "Curiosity is a powerful catalyst for boosting career- and job-related meaningfulness.",
              "This paper describes three ways a curious mindset ignites this felt sense.",
              "Steps for developing related behaviors and attitudes also are outlined.",
              "Managers, consultants, and employees are encouraged to experiment with the suggested approaches and blend them with existing personal and organizational strategies for cultivating workplace effectiveness and sense of meaning.",
              "People find their work meaningful when their actions result in fulfilling their own highly valued aims, attaining competence, experiencing positive self-regard, and forming significant connections to their jobs, peers and managers, and organizations.",
              "[1] According to a study conducted by Globoforce\u2019s WorkHuman Research Institute and IBM\u2019s Smarter Workforce Institute,[2] meaningful work emerged as the single largest contributor to a positive employee experience.",
              "Yet, a survey of more than 12,000 employees across companies and industries indicated that 50 percent of respondents lacked a sense of meaning and significance at work.",
              "[3] Even more concerning, statistics from the VIA Institute on Character indicate that 1 in 5 employees dread work or wish they could just stay home.",
              "[4] When employees lack a sense of meaning in their work, they become disengaged, and their performance and career development can suffer.",
              "Studies have shown that a lack of meaningfulness at work can increase employee stress and absenteeism while eroding work motivation, engagement, and job satisfaction.",
              "[5] According to a 2017 Gallup workplace report,[6] only 33 percent of employees report being engaged in their jobs, 51 percent of employees are actively looking for a new job or watching for openings, and 35 percent have changed jobs within the past three years.",
              "To enhance employees\u2019 meaning in work, organizations may engage employees in \u201cjob crafting,\u201d where employees co-design their work to give them purpose while still meeting the core components of their role.",
              "[7] Other approaches include encouraging employees to act as company representatives on industry-specific committees, taking on new responsibilities that expand their skillsets, or participating in peer-to-peer recognition systems. For example, JetBlue\u2019s implementation of a peer-to-peer recognition system that focused on company values resulted in an increase in employee satisfaction, which is related to meaningfulness, by 88 percent.",
              "[8] An employee\u2019s work orientation can also affect how meaning in work is experienced.",
              "For example, a person with a \u201cservice\u201d orientation may consider work meaningful if it improves others\u2019 lives or advances a cause, whereas an individual with a \u201ccareer\u201d orientation may find work meaningful when the work acts as a conduit for recognition and advancement.",
              "[9] Although adjusting and evolving job designs, practices, and culture to align employee work and meaning can be effective, these efforts require substantial time and resources.",
              "Such a significant investment may not yield results in time to support the organization\u2019s more near-term strategic objectives or impending annual goals.",
              "In these cases, it may be necessary to find alternative, more accessible ways to enhance employees\u2019 sense of meaning at work.",
              "One way business leaders can help themselves and employees enhance the meaningfulness of their work is by adopting a curious mindset.",
              "Effect 1: Engagement Curiosity has a generative nature due to inherent seeking and exploring behaviors and openness to incoming information.",
              "These behaviors comprise a so-called approach orientation and facilitate learning, competence, autonomy, and absorption in work.",
              "People exhibiting this orientation tend to engage in self-directed pursuits and potentially expand their thinking, feeling, and acting related to complex or novel problems. The result is an expanded problem-solving tool kit because these individuals tend to better withstand the distress or negative emotions associated with the challenges of autonomously driven pursuits.",
              "Curiosity researchers Dr.",
              "Todd Kashdan and colleagues added that this orientation yields a form of resiliency that enables people to be more innovative and creative.",
              "[10] Harrison, Pinkus, and Cohen found in their research that curiosity helps employees engage more deeply in their work, generate new ideas, and share those ideas with others.",
              "[11] SurveyMonkey\u2019s interim executive chairman Zander Lurie deliberately leveraged the power of curiosity for innovation.",
              "In town hall meetings and other forums, employees were encouraged to ask questions and the company celebrated the \u201cquestion of the week\u201d chosen from employee surveys.",
              "Lurie implemented a peer recognition program to reward people who dared to be especially candid and sponsored internal team hackathons that led to a significant breakthrough feature called SurveyMonkey Genius.",
              "[12] Effect 2: Interpersonal Dexterity Human beings are inherently social creatures.",
              "Michael Steger, international expert on meaning and quality of life, asserts that meaning is found primarily in who people are with rather than in what they are doing.",
              "Research suggests that employees experience richer interpersonal relationships (and, in turn, enhance their sense of meaning) when they operate from a curious mindset.",
              "This is because, based on self-report and others\u2019 observations, curious people are less anxious, timid, or defensive during initial encounters with strangers.",
              "[13],[14] Research further shows that curiosity is associated with less aggressive reactions to perceived triggers,[15] improved conflict resolution skills, enhanced motivation to put oneself in one another\u2019s shoes, less attachment to one\u2019s own ideas, and increased interest in others\u2019 ideas.",
              "[16] Accordingly, curious employees reportedly are more likely to receive social support and are more effective at building connections, trust, and commitment on their teams.[17] Managers at Procter & Gamble Brazil demonstrated these interpersonal effects when they challenged strategic and organizational traditions by self-organizing internally to ensure closer cross-functional teamwork and leveraging relationships with customers to develop low-cost, high-quality alternatives to premium products.",
              "[18] The implications of this collection of research are that adopting a curious mindset can lead to stronger interpersonal skills, which may enhance one\u2019s relationships by reducing interpersonal conflict and, in turn, deliver innovative solutions that increase one\u2019s sense of meaningfulness at work.",
              "[19] Effect 3: Growth Mindset Curiosity has been linked to growth-oriented behaviors, such as persevering over obstacles, achieving goals, and choosing activities that stretch and develop skills.",
              "Such behaviors require effort and intention, leading to a larger scale shift from individuals simply trying to prove themselves at work to individuals embracing a growth mindset by focusing on continually improving themselves.",
              "[20] A growth mindset concerns faith in one\u2019s own ability to develop and that development is important to one\u2019s work.",
              "[21] In effect, a growth mindset can promote a broadening and building of abilities stemming from continuous learning and improvement.",
              "Cultures that foster a growth mindset view all employees as possessing potential, encourage employees to develop, and acknowledge and reward improvement.",
              "Telenor, a 160-year-old Norwegian multinational telecommunications company, introduced a growth mindset culture characterized by perseverance, curiosity, and \u201casking lots of questions\u201d as part of its leadership development offerings.",
              "Telenor\u2019s aim was to increase employees\u2019 self-awareness and learning, challenge existing work processes, and support employees in going beyond comfort zones.",
              "[22] Similarly, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ignited a culture of curiosity and continuous learning through organization-wide growth mindset initiatives that help employees shift from being a group of \u201cknow-it-alls\u201d to a group of \u201clearn-it-alls.",
              "\u201d Daily pulse surveys are used to gather metrics on growth mindset indicators such as risk aversion, learning from failure, or unlocking potential.",
              "Employees\u2019 efforts to cultivate a work-related growth mindset nurture their drive, dedication, concentration, and absorption in work-related activities.",
              "In turn, their engagement is heightened, and learning and growth are catalyzed.",
              "The four attributes of curiosity help explain how these important effects arise.",
              "Curiosity is generally recognized as a catalyst of human behavior[23] and an ingredient in the pursuit of meaningful living.",
              "[24] Dr.",
              "Todd Kashdan describes curiosity in terms of four attributes: inquisitiveness, openness, creative problem solving and disruption tolerance[25] (see Figure 1).",
              "Figure 1: Four Attributes of Curiosity Inquisitiveness means leaving preconceived ideas behind and using inquiry to discover new insights and perspectives about complex issues.",
              "This helps people reframe and more deeply understand the challenge at hand, including the current situation, the desired outcome, and the resources required to reach that outcome.",
              "Inquisitiveness also is evident when employees look beyond conventional career goals to deeply reflect on the experiences, activities, and outcomes they enjoy and find valuable at work.",
              "By doing so, they are more likely to discover their unique definition of success and be better equipped to navigate their careers accordingly.",
              "Companies that do not support inquisitiveness risk employee disengagement and turnover.",
              "Quantum Workplace\u2019s 2014 study of high-turnover companies found that the second-highest-rated issue in employee engagement was the organization\u2019s lack of willingness to \u201clisten to an employee\u2019s perspectives.",
              "\u201d[26] Openness means entertaining ideas, even if they are from other companies, industries, or sources.",
              "Leaders demonstrate openness when they consider how to boost employees\u2019 sense of meaning using progressive management approaches such as experiential training programs, events, or workshops that ignite a sense of play and nonconformist thinking.",
              "Openness to experience is the drive for cognitive exploration of one\u2019s inner world, and for gathering and making meaning of new information in one\u2019s environment.",
              "Research has shown that openness to experience is more highly correlated with total creative achievement than other factors historically correlated with creative achievement such as IQ, divergent thinking, and personality traits.",
              "[27] Creative problem solving occurs when employees challenge and cross-pollinate existing knowledge and approaches with new ideas.",
              "[28] Research demonstrates that framing work around learning goals (e.",
              "g., skill development) rather than performance goals (e.",
              "g., hitting targets) boosts motivation.",
              "Those motivated by learning goals tend to acquire a greater diversity of skills, do better in problem-solving, and log better work performance, although organizations generally prioritize performance goals, according to Harvard behavioral scientist Francesca Gino.",
              "[29] Leaders can counteract this trend by advocating for the importance of learning and by rewarding people both for their performance and the learning needed to get there.",
              "Organizations with a healthy learning culture are reported to be (a) 92 percent more likely to develop novel products and processes, (b) 52 percent more productive, and (c) 17 percent more profitable than organizations that do not embrace a learning culture.",
              "[30] Research from Deloitte additionally indicates that engagement and retention rates are 30 to 50 percent higher in organizations with a strong learning culture.",
              "[31] People have disruption tolerance when they are able to stay with new solutions through the highs and lows of fully vetting a solution until lessons are able to be identified, codified, and applied.",
              "Although many people may notice opportunities and wonder about possible solutions, Kashdan and colleagues explain that disruption tolerance is needed to motivate those individuals to \u201cstep forward and explore.",
              "\u201d[32] Disruption tolerance, also referred to as stress tolerance, is evident when failure is allowed as a mechanism for learning, growth, and creativity.",
              "Intuit supports disruption tolerance through its annual awards: In addition to innovation awards for employee explorations leading to valuable new products or processes, failure awards are given for employee explorations leading to important learnings for the team (absent new products).",
              "Moreover, failure parties are held to celebrate the learnings.",
              "[33] In general, it takes practice to become more aware of curiosity and how to use it in various situations.",
              "The following sample exercises are designed to help access and harness a curious mindset.",
              "Exercise 1: Reflection At the end of each day, write down how you used your curiosity in ways that contributed to a positive or productive outcome.",
              "After two weeks, review what you wrote each day.",
              "What patterns do you see?",
              "What insights about your use of curiosity surfaced for you?",
              "How can these insights help you in the future to connect your curiosity to professional growth and/or to higher satisfaction in your work?",
              "Create your curiosity action plan in which you identify three actions you will continue to practice to encourage your curious mindset.",
              "Alternately, contemplate the following questions: Identify one \u201cstop\u201d behavior that prevents or interferes with your curiosity, and one \u201cstart\u201d behavior that encourages you to remain curious.",
              "For one month, keep a journal tracking your progress of consistently discontinuing your stop and implementing your start behavior.",
              "If at the end of the month you feel satisfied with your progress, identify a new stop behavior and a new start behavior and track your progress for another month.",
              "Each month, you can select a new start behavior and new stop behavior or return to practicing a previous start behavior and stop behavior.",
              "Exercise 2: Reframing Select a perceived business issue or problem and organize a meeting to briefly present the problem to your team or cross-functional group.",
              "Then instruct the group that they have 4 minutes to collaboratively generate 15 different questions reframing the problem.",
              "The aim of this step is not to solve the problem but to uncover, through different ways of wording it, whether an alternative problem exists whose resolution would be even more organizationally valuable.",
              "After the initial 4 minutes, take another 20 minutes to identify any additional questions missing from the 15-question set created.",
              "Then, using the entire question set, select which questions specifically identified new pathways in viewing the problem, and highlight why each pathway seems important or meaningful.",
              "Setting aside what might be the most comfortable route to pursue, commit to investigating at least one of the pathways and create an action plan for doing so.",
              "[34] Curiosity acts as a catalyst for exploration and fosters absorption, dedication, enthusiasm, and learning.",
              "Exploration of difficult, challenging, or complex situations may seem a paradoxical route to greater meaning in work.",
              "However, curiosity can serve as a motivational engine for individuals to better understand, utilize, and build their competencies to more successfully navigate their work environment and contribute in meaningful ways to both the workplace and their communities beyond themselves.",

              "That said, I do agree that running an open innovation funnel such as this does command certain degree of transparency, as to avoid the problem mentioned above of Lego potentially receiving criticism for stealing ideas from the public.",
              "This is so cool.",
              "As a Lego lover, I would have loved to have the opportunity to present the ideas I had as a kid to them.",
              "Anyway, I see this type of initiatives (at least in this case) as a marketing strategy to attract more kids into Lego, given that the effort to design and manufacture different sets is probably difficult.",
              "I wonder if this initiative could be complemented with 3D printing technologies, automating the process even more.",
              "On balancing external vs. internal product ideation, I do think that if the open innovation process proves fruitful and effective, there is space for Lego to reduce the size of its in-house design team.",
              "However, once the redundancy is removed, Lego should put the remaining inhouse team in charge of evaluating externally sourced ideas and overseeing the production process.",
              "This arrangement could help ensure 1) seamless transition between open innovation and inhouse processes, 2) buy-in from inhouse design team, and 3) ownership of follow-up steps.",
              "Regarding your concern of dissent from Lego\u2019s internal designers, I fully agree that it is ludicrous to only allow the R&D process to begin after 10,000 votes are received.",
              "There must be other options to keep everyone engaged while continuing to benefit from open innovation.",
              "For example, designers can be given more freedom prior to the 10,000 vote threshold.",
              "Only one design per year is being selected for production;",
              "this should not take too much time in aggregate.",
              "Why not allow designers to browse the concepts at an earlier stage, find some which they like, and advocate for production while completing some of the groundwork?",
              "Self-managed teams could even be introduced for this fun, extracurricular process, in order to empower employees.",
              "Other options are surely available and would add value to the current structure.",
              "Thank you for a really interesting article!",
              "It is very exciting to see Lego, a company that many of us grew up with, still being successful in the market through continuing to innovate in such a creative way through crowdsourcing.",
              "However, I think you are very right in many of the potential risks that you assert the company should be aware of.",
              "The example that you provide about Lego having trouble partnering with Mojang in order to create a Minecraft toy and its implications on the timeline of the product made me also think about the strategically vulnerable position that Lego is putting itself in through the way that this program is set up.",
              "When Lego goes to Mojang after already having raised customer expectations that a Minecraft toy would be produced (after communicating to users that the project received the green-light), Lego is in a much weaker contractual negotiating position than had they approached Mojang with the potential desire of considering a partnership given Lego\u2019s increased need to consummate the partnership or else disappoint, and potentially alienate, the many customers following Lego Ideas.",
              "This is illustrative of the lesson that empowering the consumer can make them feel more connected and engaged with your brand, a generally positive result;",
              "however, if consumer expectations are built up too high and too specifically through this empowerment, a company can be placed in a difficult spot strategically given the subsequent pressures on the company to deliver on its promises.",
              "This is a really great article \u2013 thanks!",
              "Open innovation at Lego makes a huge amount of sense, both from the perspective of reducing internal R&D costs as well as increasing customer engagement.",
              "I would view the open innovation platform as a kind of inbound marketing, building customer interest in the product, which should eventually lead to sales.",
              "I suspect that the issue of public disclosure of decision-making process will only become important when teen and adult submitters of ideas are involved \u2013 children may be happy to just send their ideas in.",
              "Interesting read!",
              "Awesome that they\u2019ve taken to using open innovation to design new products.",
              "I\u2019m wondering how this move could be combined with machine learning down the road, to mitigate some of those risks of open innovation.",
              "For example, can Lego use data about the commonalities of the top-voted products over the years to be able to design new winners of its own again?",
              "I think those two tactics in combination could give Lego the advantage its again seeking.",
              "Thanks for sharing!",
              "This is a very neat idea from Lego to reverse the typical product design process and to have partial market testing/data before it moves into the production phase.",
              "If Lego leans into this open innovation concept even further, I wonder what sort of organizational or cultural changes the company will need to make in order to fully support this process?",
              "One area of concern that I have is the ability for the company to manage the strategic partnerships while simultaneously progressing the design, which may not even be validated at all.",
              "How can the company balance between starting the conversation early with partners to minimize lead time versus starting conversations too early for products that end up failing?",
              "I love Lego!",
              "It is interesting to see how a traditional company is embracing this new trend to deliver more value to customers.",
              "Regarding your question, I think that several industries are perceiving this tension between its traditional workforce and the rising product development trends.",
              "However, I definitely believe this can be a win-win situation for the designers and for the company.",
              "The way I see it, Lego fans are contributing to the pipeline of ideas, giving more possibilities to de designers to develop.",
              "I believe this trend will allow designers to develop more successful products.",
              "We have learned in marketing that customers often don\u2019t know what they really want.",
              "Henry Ford is famous for saying that if he had asked his customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse.",
              "By inviting customers into the LEGO product development process and relying on their design votes, i wonder if the company risks missing true innovation that makes a difference.",
              "Instead of creating an open source platform of ideas and an internal LEGO member choosing a winner, I think this competition would be best set up as a social media voting system.",
              "That way there is no one offering an idea and accusing LEGO of \u201cstealing\u201d it to make a bunch of money.",
              "People would be incentivized to present their ideas more clearly.",
              "I actually think this use of open innovation may be more about launching a marketing campaign, than it is about gathering more \u201coutside-the-box\u201d ideas.",
              "There\u2019s really no harm, no foul for LEGO to give this a try!",
              "Thanks for the sharing \u2014 very cool topic.",
              "I think Lego is very smart to take the move of collecting innovative ideas from their customers.",
              "First of all, the platform can be used as consumer research, giving the company the confidence that the product is worth investing in.",
              "Second, this is also a good way to strengthen customer relationship and build up higher customer loyalty as they feel like they are a part of the product development, and will be more related to the company.",
              "They have brought the meaning of open platform to a new level.",
              "As for the concern over product design team, I believe that this is a good opportunity for them to stay close to the market and to get inspirations.",
              "Also, I believe that this is a good method to keep them alert, as now they need to compete with all kinds of people in the market.",
              "This might leads to better performance and better quality in internal innovation.",
              "Very interesting read, and a cool foil to the Amazon Studios crowdsourcing story.",
              "I love the idea of Lego using crowdsourced designs because the value proposition and use case of legos was to design and build your own creations, and this created a platform for users to share those creations.",
              "It\u2019s interesting that they took the input from the community to drive partnerships with Minecraft and others \u2013 it sounds like a great way for them to create lasting bonds with those consumers while tapping deeper into pop culture.",
              "Regarding the question around their design team, I think there\u2019s still value they drive \u2013 they can create entire worlds around a single idea pitched from the crowd and still have the ability to develop their own ideas and pieces to be used in new creations.",
              "Excellent article \u2013 very interesting read.",
              "As a personal contributor to open innovation (LEGO Ideas) for LEGO [1], I dont think designers have a diminished role.",
              "In my mind, they serve a very complimentary role \u2013 that is, to ensure that ideas that are filtered and green lit, as you mention in your article, through the open innovation process.",
              "From my point of view, the designers role is really scaling an \u201cidea\u201d into a product \u2013 that is, making tweaks to the \u201cbuildability\u201d and \u201cmarketability\u201d of the product such that the end user will want to buy the product, will find it easy to use, and can enjoy it for a future period of time.",
              "One of the biggest personal challenges I found as a crowd sourced innovator contributing to LEGO is that what I originally thought of as a good idea needed to go through several design changes through the process described above, before the end result was something that LEGO could market!",

              "So to build products that are effective for the user we need that user perspective brought back into focus pretty regularly \u2014 \u201cOh, wait, here\u2019s what the end user is going to experience\u201d Or, \u201cOh yeah, actually we don\u2019t even need to solve that really challenging, interesting technical problem over there, because the end user is only going to experience this part over here.",

              "\u201d 3.",
              "Then you get to a scale where you have a lot of users, and talking to them becomes an art of \u201cHow do I get a representative sample from this broad population?",
              "\u201d And you start to worry that maybe their memory isn\u2019t quite perfect.",
              "Users are self-reporting how they use things, but that\u2019s not actually how they use things.",
              "We know people have a lot of cognitive biases in that way.",
              "So then you start getting into observational data, and you say, \u201cwell, okay, people report that they use the product once a week.",
              "If I go look at data, I can see people use the product three times a week, so I can tell that what they report isn\u2019t quite what happened.",
              "\u201d Adding this observational data layer makes user research much higher fidelity.",

              "4.",
              "But even that observational data layer doesn\u2019t really help you understand how people use the product at the level of a deep causal connection.",
              "The end game of trying to understand the user is, \u201cif I do X, users respond this way\u201d.",
              "And the only way to establish that causal connection \u2014 maybe not the only way, but the most reliable way, the highest fidelity way \u2014 is to show a random sample of your users X and see how they differ from the rest of your users who didn\u2019t see X.",
              "That\u2019s the core of experimentation: a high cost, high fidelity, arguably lower speed, way to build empathy.",
              "It\u2019s probably not the first place you\u2019re going to turn to build empathy, but you\u2019re going to get there and you\u2019ll eventually need to have it in your arsenal.",

              "If you read our blog posts, or posts from anybody who does massive scale testing such as Microsoft, you see that they test, and most of their treatments fail.",
              "And those are treatments from expert designers and PMs and engineers who have the best context, the best user research.",
              "Especially as your product matures, it is hard to improve upon.",
              "Even a less mature product is hard to improve upon, because it turns out our intuition is pretty good.",
              "We understand what users need.",
              "It\u2019s just not a very reliable mechanism.",
              "So most treatments that we come up with fail, which means you have to have a lot of humility.",
              "You can\u2019t get married to your ideas and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to do an experiment;",
              "this is going to blow the world away.",
              "\u201d And you end up wasting a lot of time and effort trying to show that your treatment is good, even if it\u2019s not.",
              "You miss the bigger picture, which is, \u201cHey, you tried something.",
              "It didn\u2019t work.",
              "What can you learn from that experience to inform the next treatment?",
              "\u201d The cultures where people can be really successful in experimentation involve a lot of humility, which encourages that sort of iterative approach.",
              "\u201cI\u2019m guessing this is not going to work because I can see from history most of these things don\u2019t work.",
              "What I\u2019m going to do is put it out there and I\u2019m going to learn from it.",
              "Maybe I\u2019ll get lucky and it\u2019ll work right off the bat, but maybe I won\u2019t.",
              "I\u2019ll learn from the next two tests, and I\u2019ll get to someplace where I can actually solve this problem.",
              "\u201d The other thing I think is important is having a culture of open debate, where decisions are made out in the open.",
              "The more open your decision-making, the louder a voice data has.",
              "When decision-making gets closed, into one person\u2019s office or one person\u2019s head, it\u2019s hard.",
              "Often when people debate and they can\u2019t agree, they turn to data, because it\u2019s a lot harder to disagree with that.",
              "And so if you want an experimentation culture, if you want data, have open debate.",
              "Have open decision making.",
              "Then people more clearly see that they need data, that they need to experiment.",

              "Abiding by this risk aversion is challenging in our domain because experiments generally have low power (see Part 4).",
              "For example we rely on difference-in-differences techniques for unbiased comparisons between the potentially different audiences experiencing each advertising treatment, and these approaches effectively reduce the sample size (more details for the very interested reader).",

              "Particularly in regimes where experiments are low-powered, two other error types can occur with high probability, so are important to consider when acting upon a statistically significant test result: If we simply declare statistically significant test results (with positive metric movements) to be winners, a Type-S error would imply that we actually selected the wrong treatment to promote to production, and all our future advertising spend would be producing suboptimal results.",
              "A Type-M error means that we are over-estimating the impact of the treatment.",
              "In the short term, a Type-M error means we would overstate our result, and in the long-term it could lead to overestimating our optimal budget level, or even misprioritizing future research tracks.",
              "To reduce the impact of these errors, we take a Bayesian approach to experimentation in growth advertising.",
              "We\u2019ve run many tests in this area and use the distribution of metric movements from past tests as an additional input to the analysis.",
              "Intuitively (and mathematically) this approach results in estimated metric movements that are smaller in magnitude and that feature narrower confidence intervals (Part 3).",
              "Combined, these two effects reduce the risk of Type-S and Type-M errors.",
              "As the benefits from ending suboptimal treatments early can be substantial, we would also like to be able to make informed, statistically-valid decisions to end experiments as quickly as possible.",

              "The latter, when combined with decision theoretic concepts like expected loss (or risk) minimization, can be used to formally evaluate the impact of different decisions \u2014 including the decision to end the experiment early.",
              "The payments team believes that the methods of payment (credit card, direct debit, mobile carrier billing, etc) that a future or current member has access to should never be a barrier to signing up for Netflix, or the reason that a member leaves Netflix.",
              "There are numerous touchpoints between a member and the payments team: we establish relationships between Netflix and new members, maintain those relationships with renewals, and (sadly!)",
              "see the end of those relationships when members elect to cancel.",
              "We innovate on methods of payment, authentication experiences, text copy and UI designs on the Netflix product, and any other place that we may smooth the payment experience for members.",
              "In all of these areas, we seek to improve the quality and velocity of our decision-making, guided by the testing principles laid out in this series.",

              "We don\u2019t have unlimited traffic or time, so sometimes we have to make hard choices.",
              "Are there metrics that can yield a signal faster?",
              "What\u2019s the tradeoff of using those?",
              "What\u2019s the expected loss of calling this test, versus the opportunity cost of running something else?",
              "These are fun problems to tackle, and we are always looking to improve.",
              "We also actively invest in increasing decision velocity, often in close partnership with the Experimentation Platform team.",
              "Over the past year, we\u2019ve piloted models and workflows for three approaches to faster experimentation: Group Sequential Testing (GST), Gaussian Bayesian Inference, and Adaptive Testing.",
              "Any one of these techniques would enhance our experiment throughput on their own;",
              "together, they promise to alter the trajectory of payments experimentation velocity at Netflix.",
              "We want all of our members to enjoy a high quality experience whenever and however they access Netflix.",
              "Our partnerships teams work to ensure that the Netflix app and our latest technologies are integrated on a wide variety of consumer products, and that Netflix is easy to discover and use on all of these devices.",
              "We also partner with mobile and PayTV operators to create bundled offerings to bring the value of Netflix to more future members.",
              "In the partnerships space, many experiences that we want to understand, such as partner-driven marketing campaigns, are not amenable to the A/B testing framework that has been the focus of this series.",
              "Sometimes, users self-select into the experience, or the new experience is rolled out to a large cluster of users all at once.",
              "This lack of randomization precludes the straightforward causal conclusions that follow from A/B tests.",
              "In these cases, we use quasi experimentation and observational causal inference techniques to infer the causal impact of the experience we are studying.",
              "A key aspect of a data scientist\u2019s role in these analyses is to educate stakeholders on the caveats that come with these studies, while still providing rigorous evaluation and actionable insights, and providing structure to some otherwise ambiguous problems. Here are some of the challenges and opportunities in these analyses: Treatment selection confounding.",
              "When users self-select into the treatment or control experience (versus the random assignment discussed in Part 2), the probability that a user ends up in each experience may depend on their usage habits with Netflix.",
              "These baseline metrics are also naturally correlated with outcome metrics, such as member satisfaction, and therefore confound the effect of the observed treatment on our outcome metrics.",
              "The problem is exacerbated when the treatment choice or treatment uptake varies with time, which can lead to time varying confounding.",
              "To deal with these cases, we use methods such as inverse propensity scores, doubly robust estimators, difference-in-difference, or instrumental variables to extract actionable causal insights, with longitudinal analyses to account for the time dependence.",
              "Synthetic controls and structural models.",
              "Adjusting for confounding requires having pre-treatment covariates at the same level of aggregation as the response variable.",
              "However, sometimes we do not have access to that information at the level of individual Netflix members.",
              "In such cases, we analyze aggregate level data using synthetic controls and structural models.",
              "Sensitivity analysis.",
              "In the absence of true A/B testing, our analyses rely on using the available data to adjust away spurious correlations between the treatment and the outcome metrics.",
              "But how well we can do so depends on whether the available data is sufficient to account for all such correlations.",
              "To understand the validity of our causal claims, we perform sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our findings.",
              "At Netflix, we are always looking for ways to help our members choose content that\u2019s great for them.",
              "We do this on the Netflix product through the personalized experience we provide to every member.",
              "But what about other ways we can help keep members informed about new or relevant content, so they\u2019ve something great in mind when it\u2019s time to relax at the end of a long day?",
              "Messaging, including emails and push notifications, is one of the key ways we keep our members in the loop.",
              "The messaging team at Netflix strives to provide members with joy beyond the time when they are actively watching content.",
              "What\u2019s new or coming soon on Netflix?",
              "What\u2019s the perfect piece of content that we can tell you about so you can plan \u201cdate time movie night\u201d on the go?",
              "As a messaging team, we are also mindful of all the digital distractions in our members\u2019 lives, so we work tirelessly to send just the right information to the right members at the right time.",
              "Data scientists in this space work closely with product managers and engineers to develop messaging solutions that maximize long term satisfaction for our members.",
              "For example, we are constantly working to deliver a better, more personalized messaging experience to our members.",
              "Each day, we predict how each candidate message would meet a members\u2019 needs, given historical data, and the output informs what, if any, message they will receive.",
              "And to ensure that innovations on our personalized messaging approach result in a better experience for our members, we use A/B testing to learn and confirm our hypotheses.",
              "An exciting aspect of working as a data scientist on messaging at Netflix is that we are actively building and using sophisticated learning models to help us better serve our members.",
              "These models, based on the idea of bandits, continuously balance learning more about member messaging preferences with applying those learnings to deliver more satisfaction to our members.",
              "It\u2019s like a continuous A/B test with new treatments deployed all the time.",
              "This framework allows us to conduct many exciting and challenging analyses without having to deploy new A/B tests every time.",
              "When a member opens the Netflix application, our goal is to help them choose a title that is a great fit for them.",
              "One way we do this is through constantly improving the recommendation systems that produce a personalized home page experience for each of our members.",
              "And beyond title recommendations, we strive to select and present artwork, imagery and other visual \u201cevidence\u201d that is likewise personalized, and helps each member understand why a particular title is a great choice for them \u2014 particularly if the title is new to the service or unfamiliar to that member.",
              "Creative excellence and continuous improvements to evidence selection systems are both crucial in achieving this goal.",
              "Data scientists working in the space of evidence selection use online experiments and offline analysis to provide robust causal insights to power product decisions in both the creation of evidence assets, such as the images that appear on the Netflix homepage, and the development of models that pair members with evidence.",
              "Sitting at the intersection of content creation and product development, data scientists in this space face some unique challenges: Predicting evidence performance.",
              "Say we are developing a new way to generate a piece of evidence, such as a trailer.",
              "Ideally, we\u2019d like to have some sense of the positive outcomes of the new evidence type prior to making a potentially large investment that will take time to pay off.",
              "Data scientists help inform investment decisions like these by developing causally valid predictive models.",
              "Matching members with the best evidence.",
              "High quality and properly selected evidence is key to a great Netflix experience for all of our members.",
              "While we test and learn about what types of evidence are most effective, and how to match members to the best evidence, we also work to minimize the potential downsides by investing in efficient approaches to A/B tests that allow us to rapidly stop suboptimal treatment experiences.",
              "Providing timely causal feedback on evidence development.",
              "Insights from data, including from A/B tests, are used extensively to fuel the creation of better artwork, trailers, and other types of evidence.",
              "In addition to A/B tests, we work on developing experimental design and analysis frameworks that provide fine-grained causal inference and can keep up with the scale of our learning agenda.",
              "We use contextual bandits that minimize regret in matching members to evidence, and through a collaboration with our Algorithms Engineering team, we\u2019ve built the ability to log counterfactuals: what would a different selection policy have recommended?",
              "These data provide us with a platform to run rich offline experiments and derive causal inferences that meet our challenges and answer questions that may be slow to answer with A/B tests.",
              "Now that you\u2019ve signed up for Netflix and found something exciting to watch, what happens when you press play?",
              "Behind the scenes, Netflix infrastructure has already kicked into gear, finding the fastest way to deliver your chosen content with great audio and video quality.",
              "The numerous engineering teams involved in delivering high quality audio and video use A/B tests to improve the experience we deliver to our members around the world.",
              "Innovation areas include the Netflix app itself (across thousands of types of devices), encoding algorithms, and ways to optimize the placement of content on our global Open Connect distribution network.",
              "Data science roles in this business area emphasize experimentation at scale and support for autonomous experimentation for engineering teams: how do we enable these teams to efficiently and confidently execute, analyze, and make decisions based on A/B tests?",
              "We\u2019ll touch upon four ways that partnerships between data science and engineering teams have benefited this space.",
              "Automation.",
              "As streaming experiments are numerous (thousands per year) and tend to be short lived, we\u2019ve invested in workflow automations.",
              "For example, we piggyback on Netflix\u2019s amazing tools for safe deployment of the Netflix client by integrating the experimentation platform\u2019s API directly with Spinnaker deployment pipelines.",
              "This allows engineers to set up, allocate, and analyze the effects of changes they\u2019ve made using a single configuration file.",
              "Taking this model even further, users can even \u2018automate the automation\u2019 by running multiple rounds of an experiment to perform sequential optimizations.",
              "Beyond average treatment effects.",
              "As many important streaming video and audio metrics are not well approximated by a normal distribution, we\u2019ve found it critical to look beyond average treatment effects.",
              "To surmount these challenges, we partnered with the experimentation platform to develop and integrate high-performance bootstrap methods for compressed data, making it fast to estimate distributions and quantile treatment effects for even the most pathological metrics.",
              "Visualizing quantiles leads to novel insights about treatment effects, and these plots, now produced as part of our automated reporting, are often used to directly support high-level product decisions.",
              "Alternatives to A/B testing.",
              "The Open Connect engineering team faces numerous measurement challenges.",
              "Congestion can cause interactions between treatment and control groups;",
              "in other cases we are unable to randomize due to the nature of our traffic steering algorithms. To address these and other challenges, we are investing heavily in quasi-experimentation methods.",
              "We use Metaflow to pair existing infrastructure for metric definitions and data collection from our Experimentation Platform with custom analysis methods that are based on a difference-in-difference approach.",
              "This workflow has allowed us to quickly deploy self-service tools to measure changes that cannot be measured with traditional A/B testing.",
              "Additionally, our modular approach has made it easy to scale quasi-experiments across Open Connect use cases, allowing us to swap out data sources or analysis methods depending on each team\u2019s individual needs.",
              "Support for custom metrics and dimensions.",
              "Last, we\u2019ve developed a (relatively) frictionless path that allows all experimenters (not just data scientists) to create custom metrics and dimensions in a snap when they are needed.",
              "Anything that can be logged can be quickly passed to the experimentation platform, analyzed, and visualized alongside the long-lived quality of experience metrics that we consider for all tests in this domain.",
              "This allows our engineers to use paved paths to ask and answer more precise questions, so they can spend less time head-scratching and more time testing out exciting ideas.",
              "To support the scale and complexity of the experimentation program at Netflix, we\u2019ve invested in building out our own experimentation platform (referred to as \u201cXP\u201d internally).",
              "Our XP provides robust and automated (or semi automated) solutions for the full lifecycle of experiments, from experience management through to analysis, and meets the data scale produced by a high throughput of large tests.",
              "XP provides a framework that allows engineering teams to define sets of test treatment experiences in their code, and then use these to configure an experiment.",
              "The platform then randomly selects members (or other units we might experiment on, like playback sessions) to assign to experiments, before randomly assigning them to an experience within each experiment (control or one of the treatment experiences).",
              "Calls by Netflix services to XP then ensure that the correct experiences are delivered, based on which tests a member is part of, and which variants within those tests.",
              "Our data engineering systems collect these test metadata, and then join them with our core data sets: logs on how members and non members interact with the service, logs that track technical metrics on streaming video delivery, and so forth.",
              "These data then flow through automated analysis pipelines and are reported in ABlaze, the front end for reporting and configuring experiments at Netflix.",
              "Aligned with Netflix culture, results from tests are broadly accessible to everyone in the company, not limited to data scientists and decision makers.",
              "The Netflix XP balances execution of the current experimentation program with a focus on future-looking innovation.",
              "It\u2019s a virtuous flywheel, as XP aims to take whatever is pushing the boundaries of our experimentation program this year and turn it into next year\u2019s one-click solution.",
              "That may involve developing new solutions for allocating members (or other units) to experiments, new ways of tracking conflicts between tests, or new ways of designing, analyzing, and making decisions based on experiments.",
              "For example, XP partners closely with engineering teams on feature flagging and experience delivery.",
              "In success, these efforts provide a seamless experience for Netflix developers that fully integrates experimentation into the software development lifecycle.",
              "For analyzing experiments, we\u2019ve built the Netflix XP to be both democratized and modular.",
              "By democratized, we mean that data scientists (and other users) can directly contribute metrics, causal inference methods for analyzing tests, and visualizations.",
              "Using these three modules, experimenters can compose flexible reports, tailored to their tests, that flow through to both our frontend UI and a notebook environment that supports ad hoc and exploratory analysis.",
              "This model supports rapid prototyping and innovation as we abstract away engineering concerns so that data scientists can contribute code directly to our production experimentation platform \u2014 without having to become software engineers themselves.",
              "To ensure that platform capabilities are able to support the required scale (number and size of tests) as analysis methods become more complex and computationally intensive, we\u2019ve invested in developing expertise in performant and robust Computational Causal Inference software for test analysis.",
              "It takes a village to build an experimentation platform: software engineers to build and maintain the backend engineering infrastructure;",
              "UI engineers to build out the ABlaze front end that is used to manage and analyze experiments;",
              "data scientists with expertise in causal inference and numerical computing to develop, implement, scale, and socialize cutting edge methodologies;",
              "user experience designers who ensure our products are accessible to our stakeholders;",
              "and product managers who keep the platform itself innovating in the right direction.",
              "It\u2019s an incredibly multidisciplinary endeavor, and positions on XP provide opportunities to develop broad skill sets that span disciplines.",
              "Because experimentation is so pervasive at Netflix, those working on XP are exposed to challenges, and get to collaborate with colleagues, from all corners of Netflix.",
              "It\u2019s a great way to learn broadly about \u2018how Netflix works\u2019 from a variety of perspectives.",
              "At Netflix, we\u2019ve invested in data science teams that use A/B tests, other experimentation paradigms, and the scientific method more broadly, to support continuous innovation on our product offerings for current and future members.",
              "In tandem, we\u2019ve invested in building out an internal experimentation platform (XP) that supports the scale and complexity of our experimentation and learning program.",
              "In practice, the dividing line between these two investments is blurred and we encourage collaboration between XP and business-oriented data scientists, including through internal events like A/B Experimentation Workshops and Causal Inference Summits.",
              "To ensure that experimentation capabilities at Netflix evolve to meet the on-the-ground needs of experimentation practitioners, we are intentional in ensuring that the development of new measurement and experiment management capabilities, and new software systems to both enable and scale research, is a collaborative partnership between XP and experimentation practitioners.",
              "In addition, our intentionally collaborative approach provides great opportunities for folks to lead and contribute to high-impact projects that deliver new capabilities, spanning engineering, measurement, and internal product development.",
              "And because of the strategic value Netflix places on experimentation, these collaborative efforts receive broad visibility, including from our executives.",
              "So far, this series has covered the why, what and how of A/B testing, all of which are necessary to reap the benefits of an experimentation-based approach to product development.",

              "Just as the Netflix product itself has evolved over the years, our approach to developing technologies to support experimentation at scale continues to evolve.",
              "In fact, we\u2019ve been working to improve experimentation platform solutions at Netflix for more than 20 years \u2014 our first investments in tooling to support A/B tests came way back in 2001.",

              "At Netflix, we are not afraid to test boldly, and to challenge fundamental or long-held assumptions.",
              "The Top 10 list is a great example of both: it\u2019s a large and noticeable change that surfaces a new type of evidence on the Netflix product.",
              "Large tests like this can open up whole new areas for innovation, and are actively socialized and debated within the company (see below).",
              "On the other end of the spectrum, we also run tests on much smaller scales in order to optimize every aspect of the product.",
              "A great example is the testing we do to find just the right text copy for every aspect of the product.",
              "By the numbers, we run far more of these smaller and less noticeable tests, and we invest in end-to-end infrastructure that simplifies their execution, allowing product teams to rapidly go from hypothesis to test to roll out of the winning experience.",
              "As an example, the Shakespeare project provides an end-to-end solution for rapid text copy testing that integrates with the centralized Netflix experimentation platform.",
              "More generally, we are always on the lookout for new areas that can benefit from experimentation, or areas where additional methodology or tooling can produce new or faster learnings.",
              "Netflix has mature operating mechanisms to debate, make, and socialize product decisions.",
              "Netflix does not make decisions by committee or by seeking consensus.",
              "Instead, for every significant decision there is a single \u201cInformed Captain\u201d who is ultimately responsible for making a judgment call after digesting relevant data and input from colleagues (including dissenting perspectives).",
              "Wherever possible, A/B test results or causal inference studies are an expected input to this decision making process.",
              "In fact, not only are test results expected for product decisions \u2014 it\u2019s expected that decisions on investment areas for innovation and testing, test plans for major innovations, and results of major tests are all summarized in memos, socialized broadly, and actively debated.",
              "The forums where these debates take place are broadly accessible, ensuring a diverse set of viewpoints provide feedback on test designs and results, and weigh in on decisions.",
              "Invites for these forums are open to anyone who is interested, and the price of admission is reading the memo.",
              "Despite strong executive attendance, there\u2019s a notable lack of hierarchy in these forums, as we all seek to be led by the data.",
              "Netflix data scientists are active and valued participants in these forums. Data scientists are expected to speak for the data, both what can and what cannot be concluded from experimental results, the pros and cons of different experimental designs, and so forth.",

              "It\u2019s hard to maintain a big ego when anyone at the company can look at the data and see all the big ideas and investments that have ultimately not panned out.",
              "But nothing proves the value of decision making through experimentation like seeing ideas that all the experts were bullish on voted down by member actions in A/B tests \u2014 and seeing a minor tweak to a sign up flow turn out to be a massive revenue generator.",
              "At Netflix, we do not view tests that do not produce winning experience as \u201cfailures.",

              "Combining learnings from tests in a given innovation area, such as the Mobile UI experience, helps us paint a more complete picture of the types of experiences that do and do not resonate with our members, leading to new hypotheses, new tests, and, ultimately, a more joyful experience for our members.",
              "And as our member base continues to grow globally, and as consumer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, we also revisit ideas that were unsuccessful when originally tested.",
              "Sometimes there are signals from the original analysis that suggest now is a better time for that idea, or that it will provide value to some of our newer member cohorts.",
              "Because Netflix tests all ideas, and because most ideas are not winners, our culture of experimentation democratizes ideation.",

              "After all, we\u2019ll test anything before rolling it out to the member base, and even the experts have low success rates!",
              "We\u2019ve seen time and time again at Netflix that product suggestions large and small that arise from engineers, data scientists, even our executives, can result in unexpected wins.",
              "A culture of experimentation allows more voices to contribute to ideation, and far, far more voices to help inform decision making.",
              "It\u2019s a way to get the best ideas from everyone working on the product, and to ensure that the innovations that are rolled out are vetted and approved by members.",

              "evolving our internal experimentation platform to better serve a growing user community and ever increasing size and throughput of experiments.",

              "Here are a few themes that are on our radar: Increasing velocity: beyond fixed time horizon experimentation.",
              "This series has focused on fixed time horizon tests: sample sizes, the proportion of traffic allocated to each treatment experience, and the test duration are all fixed in advance.",
              "In principle, the data are examined only once, at the conclusion of the test.",
              "This ensures that the false positive rate (see Part 3) is not increased by peeking at the data numerous times.",
              "In practice, we\u2019d like to be able to call tests early, or to adapt how incoming traffic is allocated as we learn incrementally about which treatments are successful and which are not, in a way that preserves the statistical properties described earlier in this series.",
              "To enable these benefits, Netflix is investing in sequential experimentation that permits for valid decision making at any time, versus waiting until a fixed time has passed.",
              "These methods are already being used to ensure safe deployment of Netflix client applications.",
              "We are also investing in support for experimental designs that adaptively allocate traffic throughout the test towards promising treatments.",
              "The goal of both these efforts is the same: more rapid identification of experiences that benefit members.",
              "Scaling support for quasi experimentation and causal inference.",
              "Netflix has learned an enormous amount, and dramatically improved almost every aspect of the product, using the classic online A/B tests, or randomized controlled trials, that have been the focus of this series.",
              "But not every business question is amenable to A/B testing, whether due to an inability to randomize at the individual level, or due to factors, such as spillover effects, that may violate key assumptions for valid causal inference.",
              "In these instances, we often rely on the rigorous evaluation of quasi-experiments, where units are not assigned to a treatment or control condition by a random process.",
              "But the term \u201cquasi-experimentation\u201d itself covers a broad category of experimental design and methodological approaches that differ between the myriad academic backgrounds represented by the Netflix data science community.",
              "How can we synthesize best practices across domains and scale our approach to enable more colleagues to leverage quasi-experimentation?",
              "Our early successes in this space have been driven by investments in knowledge sharing across business verticals, education, and enablement via tooling.",
              "Because quasi-experiment use cases span many domains at Netflix, identifying common patterns has been a powerful driver in developing shared libraries that scientists can use to evaluate individual quasi-experiments.",
              "And to support our continued scale, we\u2019ve built internal tooling that coalesces data retrieval, design evaluation, analysis, and reproducible reporting, all with the goal to enable our scientists.",
              "We expect our investments in research, tooling, and education for quasi-experiments to grow over time.",
              "In success, we will enable both scientists and their cross functional partners to learn more about how to deliver more joy to current and future Netflix members.",
              "Experimentation Platform as a Product.",
              "We treat the Netflix Experimentation Platform as an internal product, complete with its own product manager and innovation roadmap.",
              "We aim to provide an end-to-end paved path for configuring, allocating, monitoring, reporting, storing and analyzing A/B tests, focusing on experimentation use cases that are optimized for simplicity and testing velocity.",
              "Our goal is to make experimentation a simple and integrated part of the product lifecycle, with little effort required on the part of engineers, data scientists, or PMs to create, analyze, and act on tests, with automation available wherever the test owner wants it.",
              "However, if the platform\u2019s default paths don\u2019t work for a specific use case, experimenters can leverage our democratized contribution model, or reuse pieces of the platform, to build out their own solutions.",
              "As experimenters innovate on the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in measurement methodology, experimental design, and automation, the Experimentation Platform team partners to commoditize these innovations and make them available to the broader organization.",
              "Three core principles guide product development for our experimentation platform: Netflix has a strong culture of experimentation, and results from A/B tests, or other applications of the scientific method, are generally expected to inform decisions about how to improve our product and deliver more joy to members.",
              "To support the current and future scale of experimentation required by the growing Netflix member base and the increasing complexity of our business, Netflix has invested in culture, people, infrastructure, and internal education to make A/B testing broadly accessible across the company.",
              "And we are continuing to evolve our culture of learning and experimentation to deliver more joy to Netflix members around the world.",
              "As our member base and business grows, smaller differences between treatment and control experiences become materially important.",
              "That\u2019s also true for subsets of the population: with a growing member base, we can become more targeted and look to deliver positive experiences to cohorts of users, defined by geographical region, device type, etc.",
              "As our business grows and expands, we are looking for new places that could benefit from experimentation, ways to run more experiments and learn more with each, and ways to accelerate our experimentation program while making experimentation accessible to more of our colleagues.",
              "But the biggest opportunity is to deliver more joy to our members through the virtuous cycle of experimentation.",

              "Discussion clarifies the different views, and concise writing of the core issues helps people reflect on the wise course.",
              "It also makes it easier to share views openly and widely.",

              "Just like our members, our employees have unique perspectives based on their backgrounds and experience.",
              "As we grow, we are working to make our employees, suppliers, off and on-screen talent better reflect our membership so that we can better entertain the world.",

              "Entertaining the world is an amazing opportunity and also a challenge because viewers have very different tastes and points of view.",
              "So we offer a wide variety of TV shows and movies, some of which can be provocative.",
              "To help members make informed choices about what to watch, we offer ratings, content warnings and easy to use parental controls.",
              "Not everyone will like\u2014or agree with\u2014everything on our service.",
              "While every title is different, we approach them based on the same set of principles: we support the artistic expression of the creators we choose to work with;",
              "we program for a diversity of audiences and tastes;",
              "and we let viewers decide what\u2019s appropriate for them, versus having Netflix censor specific artists or voices.",
              "As employees we support the principle that Netflix offers a diversity of stories, even if we find some titles counter to our own personal values.",
              "Depending on your role, you may need to work on titles you perceive to be harmful.",
              "If you\u2019d find it hard to support our content breadth, Netflix may not be the best place for you.",
              "We strive to develop good decision-making muscles across our company.",
              "We pride ourselves on how few, not how many, decisions our senior managers make.",
              "That said, we don\u2019t believe in hands-off management.",
              "Each leader's role is to coach, set context, give suggestions and feedback, and be highly informed about their team\u2019s work.",
              "Rather than micro-managing small decisions, leaders can explore the details of different projects.",
              "This information can then be used to set better context for their teams, so more decisions are made well.",
              "We believe Netflix is most effective and innovative when employees across the company make and own decisions.",
              "We also believe fewer management layers makes us more agile.",
              "Our \"context not control\" culture works best when leaders manage many direct reports, giving each employee sufficient autonomy to do the best work of their lives.",
              "Sometimes we have smaller teams due to specialization or sub-scale environments, but those should be exceptions and not the norm.",
              "Generally leaders find between six and twelve direct reports a good balance between too many layers and too little time to add value.",
              "There are some exceptions to \u201ccontext not control\u201d.",
              "For example, when: it\u2019s an urgent situation and there is not enough time to develop and share context;",

              "it\u2019s recognized that the wrong person is in a decision-making role (temporarily, no doubt);",
              "or an unambiguous ethical or compliance breach needs to be stopped.",
              "As companies grow, they can become highly formal and inflexible.",
              "Negative symptoms include: We avoid this by being highly aligned and loosely coupled.",
              "We spend lots of time debating and writing down strategy and context, and then trust each other to execute on tactics without prior approval.",
              "Often, two groups working on the same goals won\u2019t know the details of, or have approval over, the other\u2019s activities.",
              "If something doesn\u2019t seem right later, we have a candid discussion.",
              "We may find that the strategy was too vague (i.",

              "Ultimately, the end goal is to grow the business for a bigger impact while increasing flexibility and agility.",
              "So we seek to stay fast and nimble, even as we grow.",
              "Beyond candor in our day-to-day interactions, we act honorably, even when no one is looking.",
              "One test we use is to ask whether we would be ashamed if our actions were made public\u2014and avoid doing anything where the answer would be yes.",
              "Separately, we have lots of information that we want to keep confidential because it is commercially sensitive.",
              "We expect all employees to protect confidential company information, whether or not it is marked \u201cconfidential\u201d.",

              "When an employee donates to a charitable group, Netflix donates double that amount to the same group.",

          "The Netflix Freedom and Responsibility culture focuses on having a high-performing staff and empowers them to act autonomously.",
          "By contrast, Netflix follows a model of dispersed decision-making, which empowers lower-level employees to make decisions and own the consequences, rather than seeking approval from managers.",
          "Freedom is counterbalanced with responsibility at Netflix.",
          "If done well, this creates a culture in which freedom and responsibility spiral up: As employees enjoy more freedom, they act more responsibly, and as they act more responsibly, management can feel confident offering more freedom.",
          "In doing so, it built an innovative culture \u2013 as described in the well-known Netflix Culture Deck \u2014 with practices that went beyond conventional notions of employee retention, annual performance reviews and bonuses, says Patty McCord, former chief talent officer at Netflix, in her book Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility."
