For example, between 2010 and 2013, scientists discovered 441 new species of animals and plants in the Amazon region. That's an average of one new species every two days! Some of the newly discovered species include a monkey that purrs like a cat, a vegetarian piranha, a flame-patterned lizard, and a tiny frog that is among the smallest ever found.",
