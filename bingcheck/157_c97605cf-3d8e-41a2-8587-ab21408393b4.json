              "[6] Many of these blues elements, such as the call-and-response format, can be traced back to the music of Africa.",
              "The use of melisma and a wavy, nasal intonation also suggests a connection between the music of West and Central Africa and the blues.",
              "The belief that blues is historically derived from the West African music including from Mali is reflected in Martin Scorsese\u2019s often quoted characterization of Ali Farka Toure\u0301\u2019s tradition as constituting \"the DNA of the blues\".",

              "A third way would just be to label each 4-measure section so that the form would look like ABC.",
              "Again, however, this is a bit too non-specific because each letter doesn\u2019t really tell us all that much.",
              "We think the best form labeling system for the 12-Bar Blues is the ABACBA format, but because 12-Bar Blues is so recognizable on its own, it is likely in the table format above that you will see it and write it.",
              "While each 4-measure phrase in the chord progression is different in a 12-Bar Blues piece, if there are lyrics to the song, they will usually follow the AAB form.",
              "This means the first two lines of the lyrics will be the exact same thing, and then the third line is different.",

              "While the tables above show the \u201cstandard\u201d chord progression of a 12-Bar Blues piece, because Blues and Jazz are highly improvisational genres without strict musical rules, there are also variations that people have used over the years that change the progression slightly.",
              "Here are four examples of variations you can do to make your 12-Bar Blues a bit different.",
              "The \u201cquick four\u201d is when you move to the IV chord (subdominant) on the second measure of the first 4-measure phrase, as seen here: An example of a song that does this is Cream\u2019s cover of the Robert Johnson classic \u201cCrossroads\u201d.",
              "This occurs when the V chord, the dominant, is played for measures 9 and 10 instead of just 9 like it normally would.",
              "A song that uses this progression is \u201cRock and Roll\u201d by Led Zeppelin.",
              "A 12-Bar Blues song with an ending turnaround plays a V chord in the final measure rather than a I chord.",
              "Because the V is dominant and wants to lead back to the tonic chord, this provides a very strong pull to go back to the start of the progression and repeat it, usually with the next verse.",
              "An example of a turnaround is found in the song \u201cTush\u201d by ZZ Top.",
              "Because Blues is very similar to Jazz music, many of the 12-Bar Blues progressions use seventh chords instead of regular triad chords.",
              "This is so common it\u2019s probably easier to find Blues songs that have seventh chords than don\u2019t.",
              "Here is what the progression looks like with all seventh chords.",
              "A classic example that uses seventh chords is \u201cPride and Joy\u201d by Stevie Ray Vaughn.",
              "That\u2019s the 12-Bar Blues Form.",
              "It is a very fun form to play around in, and especially for guitar players, it is one of the most common things to learn when you\u2019re first playing an instrument.",
