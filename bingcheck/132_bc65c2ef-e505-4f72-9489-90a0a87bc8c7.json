    "query": "What was the inspiration behind the creation of the first virtual reality headset, and how has it evolved over time to become a popular tool in various industries such as gaming, education, and healthcare?",
    "response": "That's a great question. The first virtual reality headset was created in 1968 by American computer scientist Ivan Sutherland and his student Bob Sproull. It was called \"The Sword of Damocles\" and it was a large and heavy device that hung from the ceiling and displayed simple wireframe graphics[^3^] [^4^]. The inspiration behind this invention was to create a new way of interacting with computer-generated worlds.\n\nSince then, virtual reality has evolved a lot, thanks to advances in technology and gaming. Some of the milestones in VR history include:\n\n- The Sensorama machine by Morton Heilig in 1956, which combined 3D video, audio, smell, vibration and wind to create an immersive multisensory experience[^1^].\n- The Telesphere Mask by Morton Heilig in 1960, which was the first head-mounted display with stereoscopic 3D images and stereo sound[^1^].\n- The Headsight by Comeau and Bryan in 1961, which was the first motion-tracking HMD for military purposes[^1^].\n- The Oculus Rift by Palmer Luckey in 2012, which was the first consumer-oriented VR headset with a 90-degree field of vision and high-quality graphics[^1^] [^5^].\n- The HTC Vive by Valve and HTC in 2016, which was the first VR headset with room-scale tracking and motion controllers[^1^].\n- The Oculus Quest by Oculus in 2019, which was the first standalone VR headset that did not require a PC or a smartphone to run[^5^].\n\nVirtual reality has also found many applications in various industries such as gaming, education and healthcare. Some examples of how VR is used in these fields are:\n\n- Gaming: VR games provide a more immersive and realistic experience for players, who can explore different worlds, interact with characters and objects, and feel more engaged and entertained. Some popular VR games include Half-Life: Alyx, Beat Saber, Superhot VR and Resident Evil 7[^1^].\n- Education: VR can enhance learning outcomes by providing interactive and experiential learning environments that stimulate multiple senses and brain systems. VR can also facilitate collaboration, creativity and problem-solving skills among learners. Some examples of educational VR applications include Google Expeditions, which allows students to go on virtual field trips; Labster, which provides virtual labs for science education; and Mondly, which teaches languages through VR conversations[^2^] [^6^].\n- Healthcare: VR can improve healthcare delivery and outcomes by providing training, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation solutions. VR can also reduce costs, risks and errors in healthcare settings. Some examples of healthcare VR applications include Osso VR, which trains surgeons on complex procedures; Psious, which treats phobias and anxiety disorders through exposure therapy; MindMaze, which helps stroke patients recover their motor functions; and SnowWorld, which distracts burn patients from pain during wound care[^7^] [^8^] [^9^].\n\nI hope this answer gives you a brief overview of the history and applications of virtual reality.

              "Its name was a reference to the appearance of the headset, which consisted of two soda-bottle-sized cathode ray tubes mounted on either side of the user's head, with mirrors to project the image in front of their eyes.",
              "The whole set up was so heavy that the headset had to be suspended from the ceiling (like the mythical sword of Damocles).",
              "The most important element of Sutherland and Sproull's invention was not the display, however, but what it displayed.",
              "The headset showed wire-frame 3D environments (simple square rooms and shapes) generated by a computer.",
              "When the operator turned their head, sensors on the headset would relay this information to the computer, which would redraw the 3D model to adjust for the change of perspective.",
              "This redrawn model was then clipped by two independent display processors, which passed the images to the user.",
              "Although very slow by modern standards, it was reportedly close enough to real-time to give a convincing impression of standing inside a virtual environment.",
              "The Sword of Damocles was also the first AR headset, capable of displaying information onto clear reflectors in front of the user's eyes.",
              "Sutherland explains this possible mode of operation in his paper on the invention:\"Half-silvered mirrors in the prisms through which the user looks allow him to see both the images from the cathode ray tubes and objects in the room simultaneously.",

              "The Sword of Damocles was the name for an early virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display and tracking system.",
              "[1] It is widely considered to be the first augmented reality HMD system, although Morton Heilig had already created a stereoscopic head-mounted viewing apparatus without head tracking (known as \"Stereoscopic-Television Apparatus for Individual Use\" or \"Telesphere Mask\") earlier, patented in 1960.",
              "[2] The Sword of Damocles was created in 1968 by computer scientist Ivan Sutherland with the help of his students Bob Sproull, Quintin Foster, and Danny Cohen.",
              "Before he began working toward what he termed \"the ultimate display\",[3] Ivan Sutherland was already well respected for his accomplishments in computer graphics (see Sketchpad).",
              "At MIT's Lincoln Laboratory beginning in 1966, Sutherland and his colleagues performed what are widely believed to be the first experiments with head-mounted displays of different kinds.",
              "The device was primitive both in terms of user interface and realism, and the graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple wireframe rooms. Sutherland's system displayed output from a computer program in the stereoscopic display.",
              "The perspective that the software showed the user would depend on the position of the user's gaze \u2013 which is why head tracking was necessary.",
              "The HMD had to be attached to a mechanical arm suspended from the ceiling of the lab partially due to its weight, and primarily to track head movements via linkages.",
              "The formidable appearance of the mechanism inspired its name.",
              "While using The Sword of Damocles, a user had to have his or her head securely fastened into the device to perform the experiments.",
              "At this time, the various components being tested were not fully integrated with one another.",
              "[4] When Sutherland moved to the University of Utah in the late 1960s, work on integrating the various components into a single HMD system was begun.",
              "By the end of the decade, the first fully functional integrated HMD system was operational.",
              "The first display application was a cube suspended in the air in front of the user.",
              "The system itself consisted of six subsystems: a clipping divider, matrix multiplier, vector generator, headset, head-position sensor, and a general-purpose computer \u2013 which would make these the components of the first virtual reality machine as we know them today.",
              "The unit was partially see-through, so the users were not completely cut off from their surroundings.",
              "[4] This translucence combined with the other features in their infancy is why the system is often cited as a precursor to augmented reality technology as well.",
              "Kalawsky contends that the first HMD fieldwork was conducted by Philco in 1961.",
              "Their system used a head mounted display to monitor conditions in another room, using magnetic tracking to monitor the user's head movements.",
              "The Philco HMD displayed actual video from a remotely mounted camera.",
              "The position of the camera was moved according to the tracked head movements, creating a sense of telepresence.",
              "[5] In 1963, Bell Helicopter company in Fort Worth, Texas experimented with a pilot controlled night vision system.",
              "The servo-controlled remote viewing device employed a headset displaying an augmented view of the ground for the pilot via an infrared camera mounted under the helicopter.",
              "The remote vision system display was similar to the Philco system.",
              "Ivan Sutherland's breakthrough was to imagine a computer to supply graphics output to the viewing device.",
              "Sutherland modestly stated, \"My little contribution to virtual reality was to realize we didn't need a camera \u2013 we could substitute a computer.",
              "However, in those days no computer was powerful enough to do the job so we had to build special equipment\".",

              "The truth is that virtual reality is much, much older.",
              "The science behind virtual reality was first explored in a practical sense as far back as the 1800s, but some could argue that it goes all the way back to Leonardo Da Vinci and the first explorations of perspective in paintings of the era.",
              "So how do virtual reality headsets work, and how come it took so long for them to become, well, a reality?",
              "Stay ahead of your peers in technology and engineering - The Blueprint A virtual reality headset works because of a physiological concept known as stereopsis.",
              "You may not have heard the proper name, but you know about it;",
              "this refers to our ability to perceive depth because of the subtle horizontal differences in the image that each eye receives when we look at something.",
              "Close one eye and focus on something with the open eye, now close that eye and open your other one while still looking at the object and you can plainly see the horizontal difference we're talking about.",
              "These two different viewing angles are processed by our brains and relative depth is calculated based on how divergent the images are.",
              "If they barely diverge, then we know the object is far away.",
              "If they diverge significantly, the object is closer to us.",
              "SEE ALSO: FACEBOOK'S NEW APP 'SPACES' ALLOWS YOU TO HANG OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS IN VR Renaissance painters intuitively grasped this as they developed the concept of perspective in their art, and Da Vinci came painfully close to uncovering the physiology that produced depth-perception, but the actual, formal discovery of stereopsis wouldn\u2019t come until the 19th century.",
              "Sir Charles Wheatstone, the English physicist who produced many inventions over the course of his career\u2014most famously the Wheatstone Bridge\u2014was the first person to discover the scientific basis for our ability to perceive depth.",
              "Writing in his work Contributions to the Physiology of Vision, Wheatstone makes the essential discovery that the degree of dissimilarity between the images projected onto the retina is what gives rise to perspective and depth perception.",
              "To demonstrate this, he invented the stereoscope, which recreated a three-dimensional image from two slightly dissimilar perspectives of the same scene.",
              "A very popular device in the Victorian era, the stereoscope was the first step towards the modern virtual reality headset.",
              "These headsets, or head-mounted displays (HMD) as they are known, use the exact same principle as Wheatstone\u2019s stereoscope, but instead of a still scene from a penny-dreadful, modern HMDs harness the incredible power of computers to produce entire virtual worlds.",
              "This obviously took a long time to come to fruition, and the road between the stereoscope and virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive is a long, and bumpy one.",
              "It would take more than a century for virtual reality as we know it to take shape.",
              "In 1935, Stanley Weinbaum published Pygmalion's Spectacles, a story in which a man wears a pair of goggles and is transported to a fictional\u2014some might say virtual\u2014reality with holograms and other sensory stimulation.",
              "This is thought by some to be one of the first expressions of the virtual reality concept as we know it today, though the implementation of this vision would still take another couple of decades.",
              "Morton Heilig wasn\u2019t a scientist by trade, he was a cinematographer, but what he created is shocking in its prescience.",
              "In 1962, he patented a virtual reality machine he called the Sensorama, and it provided the first virtual reality experience in history.",
              "A large, booth-like machine, the Sensorama had enough room for four people and used a variety of technologies to recreate a virtual experience using color 3D video, stereo sound, vibrations, artificial effects like wind, and smell.",
              "Only six films were ever developed for it though, and the idea never took off.",
              "It would be a complete commercial failure, but the ideas behind the Sensorama, the total immersiveness of the experience, live on to this day.",
              "Even more remarkable was what Heilig patented just two years earlier in 1960\u2014the Telesphere Mask, an HMD that featured two different television screens to create a 3D moving image.",
              "Heilig\u2019s original patent could easily be mistaken for one filed by a hardware manufacturer today and was the progenitor of all the virtual reality headsets that would come after, though Heilig tragically never found the commercial success that later manufacturers did.",
              "The Telesphere Mask was also a bust, and when his widow, Marianne Heilig, tried to donate the original prototype to a museum, they refused to take it, not even for free.",

              "He dubbed it \"Experience Theater\", and detailed his vision of multi-sensory theater in a 1955 paper, \"The Cinema of the Future\" (Robinett 1994).",

              "The Sensorama was able to display stereoscopic 3-D images in a wide-angle view, provide body tilting, supply stereo sound, and also had tracks for wind and aromas to be triggered during the film.",

              "Jul 23, 2018 Blog Information Technology The History and Evolution of Virtual Reality Technology The concept of virtual reality, while seemingly so entrenched in the 21st century, actually spans several decades beginning in the 1930s.",
              "The evolution from science fiction fantasy to, well, a reality, is fascinating.",
              "This excerpt from the report \u201cVirtual and Augmented Reality: Technologies and Global Markets,\u201d provides a timeline of several important highlights.",
              "The concept of virtual reality dates back to the 1930s when \u201cPygmalion\u2019s Spectacles,\u201d a story written by science fiction writer Stanley G.",
              "Weinbaum, presented the idea of a pair of goggles that let the wearer experience a fictional world through holographics \u2013 three-dimensional images created with photographic projection, taste, smell and touch.",
              "Stanley\u2019s description of the experience for those wearing the goggles is uncannily like the modern and emerging experience of virtual reality, making him a creative inspiration for the field.",
              "In the mid-1950s, cinematographer Morton Heilig developed the Sensorama, which was one of the earliest-known examples of immersive, multi-sensory (now known as multimodal) technology.",
              "It was a mechanical device that featured stereo speakers, a stereoscopic display, fans, smell generators and a vibrating chair.",
              "In 1960, Heilig\u2019s Telesphere Mask became the first VR head-mounted display (HMD), providing stereoscopic 3D and wide vision with stereo sound.",
              "In 1961, two Philco Corporation engineers (Comeau and Bryan) developed Headsight, a television surveillance system incorporated with magnetic motion tracking connected to a closed-circuit camera and a video screen.",
              "Headsight was developed to allow the immersive viewing of an unpredictable situation by the military, but it was not actually developed for virtual reality applications.",
              "Headsight was the first step in the evolution of VR head-mounted displays, but the integration of computer and image generation was yet to be included.",
              "In 1965, Ivan Sutherland developed the Ultimate Display, a HMD system that could simulate reality to the point where one could not tell the difference between the real and virtual world.",
              "Sutherland\u2019s concept included a virtual world that could be viewed through a head-mounted display and appeared realistic through 3D sound and tactile feedback.",
              "Computer hardware was used to create the virtual word and maintain it in real time, and users could interact with objects in the virtual world in a realistic way.",
              "In 1968, Sutherland, along with his student Bob Sproull, developed the Sword of Damocles, the first AR/VR device, which featured a head-mounted display that hung from the ceiling.",
              "However, this technology was closer to virtual technology than augmented technology.",
              "In 1969, a virtual reality computer artist, Myron Krueger, now considered one of the first-generation virtual and augmented reality researchers, developed a series of experiences termed as artificial reality, in which he developed computer-generated environment that reacted to people.",
              "His projects were Glowflow, Metaplay and Psychic Space and led to development of the Videoplace technology.",
              "The purpose of this technology was to enable people to communicate with each other in a responsive computer-generated environment despite being miles apart.",
              "Even after several changes in the development of virtual reality, the name was not used to describe the field until Jaron Lanier, founder of the Visual Programming Lab (VPL), coined the term \u201cvirtual reality\u201d in 1987.",
              "Lanier, through VPL Research, developed a range of virtual reality gear that included the DataGlove and the EyePhone head-mounted display, which were major developments in the area of virtual reality.",
              "In 1974, Myron Krueger developed a projection system and video cameras called Videoplace, which produced shadows on a screen.",
              "It showcased the ability of being in an interactive environment for users.",
              "In 1990, the term \u201cAugmented Reality\u201d was coined by Tom Caudell, a Boeing researcher.",
              "Then in 1992, Louis Rosenburg, from the U.",
              "S.",
              "Air Force\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center, created the first operative AR robotic system, which he called Virtual Fixtures.",
              "This was known as a premature version of today\u2019s AR devices.",
              "In the early 1990s, virtual reality devices were commercially available, but the technology was still far too expensive for most people.",
              "The U.",
              "K.",
              "-based company Virtuality Group then launched a range of arcade games and machines with which players could wear a set of VR goggles and play on gaming machines with real-time immersive stereoscopic 3D visuals.",
              "In 1992, \u201cThe Lawnmower Man,\u201d a science-fiction action-horror film directed by Brett Leonard, introduced the concept of virtual reality to a wider audience.",
              "A part of the movie was based on Jaron Lanier, the founder of virtual reality, and his early laboratory works.",
              "The actual virtual reality equipment from VPL Research labs was used in the film and the director, Brett Leonard, shared that he drew inspiration from companies like VPL.",
              "In 1993, Sega announced the Sega VR headset for the Sega Genesis console at the Consumer Electronics Show.",
              "The headset prototype had a head tracking device with wrap-around stereo sound and LCD screens.",
              "Sega intended to release the product at a price point of about $200 in 1993, which was equivalent to $322 in 2015.",
              "However, because of technical difficulties, the device remained in the prototype phase despite four games being developed for it.",
              "In 1994, Dancing in Cyberspace was the first theater production to use augmented reality.",
              "The theater presented acrobats on stage in and around virtual objects.",
              "In 1995, the Nintendo Virtual Boy, originally known as VR-32, was launched.",
              "It was a 3D gaming console that was promoted to be the first-ever portable console that could display true 3D graphics.",
              "The product was first released in Japan and North America at a price of $180, but it was a commercial failure despite price drops.",
              "The main reasons for this failure were the lack of graphics color (the games were only capable of displaying red graphics on a black background), lack of software support and difficulty using the console in a comfortable position.",
              "The following year, Nintendo discontinued its production and sale.",
              "In 1998, the 1st and Ten line computer system, which showed the original virtual yellow first down marker during a live National Football League game, was used by Sportsvision;",
              "this is now a norm in all televised football games and represents a significant phase of AR history.",
              "Then in 1999, NASA used AR technology to improve navigation through their X-38 spacecraft using a hybrid synthetic vision system.",
              "In 1999, Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski, who are both American film directors, screenwriters and producers, directed the film \u201cThe Matrix.",
              "\u201d The film portrays characters living in a fully simulated world, with many of them being completely unaware they do not live in the real world.",
              "\u201cThe Matrix\u201d had a major cultural impact and brought the topic of simulated reality into the mainstream.",
              "In 2000, Hirokazu Kato, from the Nara Institute of Science and Technology in Japan, created AR software called ARToolKit.",
              "In 2009, ARToolKit made augmented reality available to Internet browsers.",
              "AR technology has come a long way since its early conception, and advancements in the past several years have been even more encouraging.",
              "The last 15 years have seen several significant advancements in the development of virtual reality and augmented reality technology.",
              "Notably, compact and powerful mobile technologies have increased in prevalence while prices have simultaneously decreased.",
              "The impressive growth of VR and AR in gaming and other applications has contributed significantly to the market over the last two decades.",
              "In 2014, the acquisition of Oculus by Facebook was a game-changer for the VR industry.",
              "Major tech giants such as Google released interim virtual reality products like the DIY headset, which uses Google Cardboard and Google Daydream with smartphones.",
              "Companies like Samsung have taken this concept further with products such as Galaxy Gear, which contains smart features such as gesture control.",
              "It seems clear that the next few years will be key for the VR and AR industry.",

              "Luckey was late\u2014very late, in fact\u2014but that wasn\u2019t the only thing making them edgy.",
              "Just days before, the three video game industry veterans had agreed to found a company with Luckey to develop a device he called the Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset that had been lauded as revolutionary by nearly everyone who had tested it.",
              "Because this new venture conflicted with a deal they\u2019d made with another tech company, partnering with Luckey meant potentially forfeiting millions of dollars.",
              "And therein lay the source of their anxiety: Not only were they walking away from a lot of money, the three were gambling on a product they had never actually tried themselves.",

              "Even better, for Facebook\u2019s purposes, virtual reality could allow users to share entire immersive experiences, rather than just photos.",
              "To Jeremy Bailenson, the director of Stanford University\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab and the co-author of the book Infinite Reality, the widespread use of virtual reality has the potential not just to change our leisure habits but to alter how we think and live.",

              "While working on a live Tesla coil, Luckey once accidentally touched a grounded metal bed frame, and blew himself across the garage;",
              "another time, while cleaning an infrared laser, he burned a gray spot into his vision.",
              "When Luckey was 15, he started \u201cmodding\u201d video game equipment: taking consoles like the Nintendo GameCube, disassembling them, and modifying them with newer parts, to transform them into compact, efficient and hand-crafted devices.",
              "\u201cModding was more interesting than just building things entirely using new technologies,\u201d Luckey told me.",
              "\u201cIt was this very special type of engineering that required deeply understanding why people had made the decisions they made in designing the hardware.",
              "\u201d Luckey soon became obsessed with PC gaming.",
              "How well, he wondered, could he play games?",

              "\u201d By this time, Luckey was making good money fixing broken iPhones, and he spent most of it on high-end gaming equipment in order to make the experience as immersive as possible.",
              "At one point, his standard gaming setup consisted of a mind-boggling six-monitor arrangement.",
              "\u201cIt was so sick,\u201d he recalled.",
              "But it wasn\u2019t enough.",
              "Luckey didn\u2019t just want to play on expensive screens;",
              "he wanted to jump inside the game itself.",
              "He knew the military sometimes trained soldiers using virtual reality headsets, so he set out to buy some\u2014on the cheap, through government auctions.",
              "\u201cYou\u2019d read that these VR systems originally cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you thought, clearly if they\u2019re that expensive, they must be really good,\u201d Luckey said.",
              "Instead, they fell miles short of his hopes.",
              "The field of view on one headset might be so narrow that he\u2019d feel as if he was looking through a half-opened door.",
              "Another might weigh ten pounds, or have preposterously long lag between his head moving and the image reacting onscreen\u2014a feature common to early VR that literally makes users nauseated.",
              "So Luckey decided to do what he\u2019d been doing for years with game consoles: He\u2019d take the technology apart, figure out where it was falling short and modify it with new parts to improve it.",
              "Very quickly, he realized that this wasn\u2019t going to be simple.",
              "\u201cIt turned out that a lot of the approaches the old systems were taking were dead ends,\u201d he said.",
              "The problem was one of fundamental design philosophy.",
              "In order to create the illusion of a three-dimensional digital world from a single flat screen, VR manufacturers had typically used complex optical apparatuses that magnified the onscreen image to fill the user\u2019s visual field while also correcting for any distortion.",
              "Because these optics had to perform a variety of elaborate tricks to make the magnified image seem clear, they were extremely heavy and costly to produce.",

              "He tinkered with different screens, mixed and matched parts from his collection of VR hardware, and refined the motion tracking equipment, which monitored the user\u2019s head movements in real-time.",

              "\u201d Spend a few minutes inside the Rift, though, and one can\u2019t help but believe that Luckey will be the one to do it.",
              "*** \u201cOh, wow,\u201d chuckled the older gentleman ahead of me in the Oculus demo room, his head nodding about with a Rift prototype, the DK2, slung like a pair of thick black ski goggles over his face.",

              "All day, I\u2019d been giddy about my impending journey into the intoxicating new virtual world, and my time of revelation was achingly close.",
              "Finally, Joseph Chen, a bullet-headed Oculus product lead, ushered me onto the still-warm demo chair.",
              "This version of the Rift, he explained, had come a long way from earlier iterations.",
              "Whereas previously the headset\u2019s dozens of tiny infrared LEDs\u2014continuously monitored by a camera to mirror the user\u2019s head movements\u2014had been exposed, now they were invisible beneath the Rift\u2019s smooth plastic veneer.",
              "Its software could render video at 75 frames per second (compared with high-definition TV\u2019s paltry 24), making the virtual experience feel smooth and natural instead of nauseatingly choppy.",
              "At long last, I strapped on the Rift\u2014which, with my glasses on, made an uncomfortably tight fit\u2014and braced myself to vault headlong into the future.",
              "And my first impression of said future, I must report, was that it was neat enough\u2014but not quite mind-blowing.",
              "Mind-breezing, you might say.",
              "As soon as the Rift came down over my eyes, I found myself hovering above an archipelago of verdant land masses, staring down at a cartoonish orange fox.",

              "Yet the experience truly was different.",
              "I could gaze up and see clouds floating through a blue sky, look over to find a crashing waterfall, and peer around to get a better view of the swinging wooden mallets through which Lucky was supposed to navigate.",
              "At one point, a pair of sapphire butterflies fluttered right before my eyes, making me draw back in surprise.",
              "The problem, though, was that I felt as if I was exploring Lucky\u2019s world with wire mesh over my eyes.",
              "This is the so-called \u201cscreen door\u201d effect\u2014the product of the Rift\u2019s screen being magnified so greatly that the black squares around the pixels become visible\u2014and it\u2019s a distracting barrier to the immersion process.",
              "But, in time, I felt myself learning to ignore the screen door and enjoy the Rift for what it was: a novel, immersive new digital medium.",
              "When Chen cued up a different program\u2014a graphics demo in which you perch over a stone labyrinth filled with tiny marching dwarves\u2014I started to grow legitimately excited about the Rift\u2019s promise.",
              "As the minutes ticked by, my brain began to forget that this digital world wasn\u2019t actually reality.",
              "With a tilt of my head, I could stare down into a glowing river of magma flowing between my legs, and it almost seemed as though I would scorch my hand if I reached down and touched it.",
              "When the Rift arrives in stores, it will be an imperfect, fledgling product, but one that promises previously unimaginable new experiences.",
              "Luckey himself agrees with this assessment.",
              "\u201cThis is the Model T,\u201d he told me.",

              "It was the first virtual reality headset to provide a realistic experience at an accessible price, utilizing novel technology to increase quality and reduce cost by orders of magnitude compared to earlier systems.[1] The first headset in the line was the Oculus Rift DK1, released on March 28, 2013.",
              "[2] The last was the Oculus Rift S, discontinued in April of 2021.",
              "The Rift went through various pre-production models prior to the release of the Oculus Rift CV1, the first Oculus Rift intended for use by the general public.",
              "Two of these, the DK1 in early-2013 and DK2 in mid-2014, were intended to provide content developers with a development kit platform to create content for the Rift's eventual consumer release.",
              "However, both development kits were purchased by many gaming enthusiasts who wished to get an early preview of the technology.",
              "[3] The Rift saw its official consumer release in March 2016 with the Rift CV1, and was eventually replaced in March 2019 by the Oculus Rift S.",
              "[4][5][6] The Oculus Rift software library is still compatible with its successor, the Oculus Quest.",
              "[7] The first prototype of the Oculus Rift was created in 2011 by Palmer Luckey (then 18 years old) in his parents\u2019 garage in Long Beach, California.",
              "[8] Luckey had been building his own virtual reality headsets since 2009, but the 2011 prototype was the first to incorporate key technologies like geometric pre-distortion and a wide stereoscopic field-of-view that would come to define all of his subsequent designs.",
              "[9] Luckey decided to drop out of college and start Oculus VR, intending to turn his prototype into the world's first mass-produced virtual reality headset.",
              "[10] Noted videogame pioneer John Carmack, the founder of id Software, had been doing extensive research into virtual reality technology, leading Luckey to lend him a prototype Oculus Rift.",
              "Carmack wrote a public review of the prototype calling it \"by far the most immersive HMD\" he had used, noting that the targeted price would also make it the cheapest.",
              "[11] At the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Id Software gave demonstrations of their games running on the prototype Oculus Rift and announced that their newest game, Doom 3 BFG Edition, would be compatible with the Oculus Rift.",
              "[12] These early prototypes used a high speed IMU, 5.",
              "6\" LCD, and wide-FOV optics to project a 90 degrees horizontal and 110 degrees vertical stereoscopic 3D view onto the retina of the user.",
              "[13][14] Two months after being formed as a company, Palmer's Oculus VR launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign on August 1, 2012, for their virtual reality headset, named the Rift.",
              "The main purpose of the Kickstarter was to get an Oculus Rift prototype\u2014now referred to as DK1 (Development Kit 1)\u2014into the hands of developers to begin integration of the device into their games.",
              "[15][16] The DK1 was given as a reward to backers who pledged $300 or more on Kickstarter, and was later sold publicly for $300 on their website.",
              "These kits sold at a rate of 4\u20135 per minute for the first day, before slowing down throughout the week.",
              "[17][18] The Rift DK1 was released on March 29, 2013,[19] and uses a 7-inch (18 cm) screen with a significantly lower pixel switching time than the original prototype, reducing latency and motion blur when turning one's head quickly.",
              "The pixel fill is also better, reducing the screen door effect and making individual pixels less noticeable.",
              "The LCD is brighter and the color depth is 24 bits per pixel.",
              "The 7-inch screen also makes the stereoscopic 3D no longer 100% overlapping, the left eye seeing extra area to the left and the right eye seeing extra area to the right, in which there is no 3D depth perception.",
              "The field of view (FOV) is more than 90 degrees horizontal (110 degrees diagonal), which is more than double the FOV of previous VR devices from other companies, and is the primary strength of the device.",
              "The resolution is 1280\u00d7800 (16:10 aspect ratio), which leads to an effective of 640\u00d7800 per eye (4:5 aspect ratio).",
              "However, since the device does not feature a 100% overlap between the eyes, the combined horizontal resolution is effectively greater than 640.",
              "The image for each eye is shown in the panel as a barrel distorted image that is then corrected by pincushion effect created by lenses in the headset, generating a spherical-mapped image for each eye.",
              "Initial prototypes used a Hillcrest Labs 3DoF head tracker that is normally 125 Hz, with a special firmware requested by John Carmack that makes it run at 250 Hz, tracker latency being vital due to the dependency of virtual reality's realism on response time.",
              "The latest version includes Oculus's new 1000 Hz Adjacent Reality Tracker, which aims to provide much lower latency tracking than almost any other tracker.",
              "It uses a combination of three-axis gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers, which make it capable of absolute (relative to Earth) head orientation tracking without drift.",
              "[20] The Development Kit 1 also included interchangeable lenses that aim to allow for simple dioptric correction.",
              "The entire source for the Rift DK1 was released to the public in September 2014, including the firmware, schematics, and mechanicals for the device.",
              "The firmware is released under a simplified BSD license, while the schematics and mechanicals are released under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.",
              "0 International License.",
              "[21] In June 2013, a prototype of the Rift that used a 1080p LCD panel was shown at Electronic Entertainment Expo.",
              "This step forwards to twice the number of pixels as DK1 significantly reduced the screen door effect and made objects in the virtual world more clear, especially at a distance.",
              "The poor resolution had been the main criticism of the DK1.",
              "[22] This HD prototype is the only prototype of the Rift shown to the public which did not turn into a publicly available developer kit.",
              "In January 2014, an updated prototype codenamed \"Crystal Cove\" was unveiled at Consumer Electronics Show, which used a special low-persistence of vision OLED display as well as a new motion tracking system that utilized an external camera to track infrared dots located on the headset.",
              "The new motion tracking system would allow the system to detect actions such as leaning or crouching, which was claimed to help alleviate sickness experienced by users when the software did not respond to these actions.",
              "[23] Oculus began shipping Development Kit 2 (DK2) in July 2014.",
              "[24] This is a small refinement of the \"Crystal Cove\" prototype, featuring several key improvements over the first development kit, such as having a higher-resolution (960\u00d71080 per eye) low-persistence OLED display, higher refresh rate of 75 Hz,[25] positional tracking, a detachable cable, and the omission of the need for the external control box.",
              "A teardown of DK2 revealed that it incorporates a modified Samsung Galaxy Note 3 smartphone display, including the front panel from the device itself.",
              "[26] In February 2015, Oculus announced that over 100,000 DK2 units had been shipped up until that point.",
              "[27] In September 2014, Oculus once again presented an updated version of the Rift, codenamed Crescent Bay.",
              "This version has a greater resolution than the DK2, a lower weight, built-in audio, and 360-degree tracking thanks to the presence of tracking LEDs in the back of the headset.",
              "[28] Oculus has also licensed software library RealSpace3D, which is expected to provide the Rift with HRTF and reverb algorithms.[28] During a panel at SXSW 2015, titled \"Explore the Future of VR\", it was publicly announced for the first time that the prototype uses two screens instead of one as previously thought.",
              "[29] Oculus VR announced on May 6, 2015, that the consumer version of the Rift would ship in the first quarter of 2016,[30] and on March 25, 2016, the first batch of headsets began shipping to consumers.",
              "[31] The consumer version is an improved version of the Crescent Bay Prototype, featuring per-eye displays with a 1080\u00d71200 resolution, running at 90 Hz, 360-degree positional tracking, integrated audio, a vastly increased positional tracking volume, and a heavy focus on consumer ergonomics and aesthetics.",
              "[32] In March 2019, during the announcement of the Rift S, it was said that the Rift S would replace the original Rift.",
              "[33] However, Oculus VR stated that they planned to support the CV1 with software updates for \"the foreseeable future\".",
              "[34] On May 21, 2019, Oculus began shipping a new VR headset known as Rift S.",
              "[35] The Rift S has a 1,280[36] \u00d71,440 LCD @ 80 Hz and slightly larger field of view than that of the CV1, but lacks mechanical IPD adjustment (IPD adjustment is software-only).",
              "The Rift S tracks the position of itself and its controllers in 3D space using a system known as Oculus Insight, which uses the 5 cameras on the HMD to track points in the environment and infrared LEDs on the controllers, information from accelerometers in both the HMD and controllers, and computer vision to predict what path the HMD and controllers are most likely to take.",
              "[37] The Rift S uses a DisplayPort 1.",
              "2 port and one USB 3.",
              "0 port, as opposed to the HDMI and USB 3.",
              "0 port used on the Rift CV1.",
              "The Rift S targeted the same price point (USD$399) and hardware requirements as the Rift CV1, and has replaced the Rift CV1 since.",
              "[2] During September 2020, it was announced that the Rift S would be discontinued in 2021 in order for Oculus to focus on the Oculus Quest 2.",
              "[38] In 2021, the Rift S was officially discontinued and was no longer available on the Oculus website, effectively ending the Rift line.",
              "[39] The Oculus Rift runtime officially supports Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.",
              "The installation package includes components such as the headset driver (which includes Oculus Display driver and controller drivers), Positional Tracking Sensor driver, Oculus Service, and Oculus Home Application.",
              "[40] The runtime service implements a number of processing techniques intended to minimize latency and in addition improve the smoothness of VR applications under weaker hardware.",
              "These include direct mode, asynchronous timewarp, and asynchronous spacewarp.",
              "[41] When the user puts on the Rift and no other content is being outputted to the headset, they are presented with Oculus Home.",
              "This is the default environment of the Rift, which presents them with a loft environment and a floating menu, allowing the user to launch VR applications they own, see if their friends are using the Rift, and purchase virtual reality content on the Oculus Home store from the headset.",
              "[42] An update to the base software, called Core 2.",
              "0, introduced a more interactive default environment, allowing the user to navigate and customize it with imported 3D models.",
              "[43] However in 2023, Meta, formerly known as Oculus, closed Oculus Home and killed it off.",
              "[44] Oculus maintains a market place for applications for the headsets.",
              "The listings are curated to only allow applications that run smoothly on the recommended hardware.",
              "Most listings are also rated on their comfort level based on their likelihood of causing motion sickness or number of jump scares.",
              "However, developers do not have to use Oculus Home to distribute content for the Rift, this being entirely optional.",
              "[45] The Store can be accessed from the VR-based Oculus Home, from its desktop app, or on the Oculus web site under the section \"Experiences.\"",
              "Listings on the registry include: Content for the Rift is developed using the Oculus PC SDK, a free proprietary SDK available for Microsoft Windows (OSX and Linux support is planned for the future).",
              "[46] This is a feature complete SDK which handles for the developer the various aspects of making virtual reality content, such as the optical distortion and advanced rendering techniques.",
              "[47] The Oculus SDK is directly integrated with the popular game engines Unity 5, Unreal Engine 4, and Cryengine.",
              "This allows for developers already familiar with these engines to create VR content with little to no VR-specific code.",
              "[48][49][50] The Rift is an open platform, and thus developers do not need any approval or verification to develop, distribute, or sell content for it, and do not have to pay any licensing fees.",
              "The SDK, however, cannot be modified or reused for other purposes or hardware without permission.",

              "\u201d Like any good scientist, he first explains his methodology for the measurements: I placed a 36\u2032\u2032 long ruler onto the floor in the center of my tracked space, and measured the 3D position of each 1\u2032\u2032 mark using a small probe tip I attached to one of the tracked controllers (the probe tip\u2019s position in the controller\u2019s local coordinate frame, which is essential for repeatable point measurements, was derived from a simple calibration procedure).",
              "I then compared the resulting set of 3D points to the \u201cideal\u201d set of 3D points, generated by computing each mark\u2019s theoretical position in some arbitrary coordinate system, by running a non-linear point set alignment algorithm.",

              "Similar to its predecessor, Oculus Go, it is a standalone device, that can run games and software wirelessly under an Android-based operating system.",
              "It supports positional tracking with six degrees of freedom, using internal sensors and an array of cameras in the front of the headset rather than external sensors.",

              "[21] Rather than use external sensor cameras in the play area to spatially track the headset and controllers (as was the case with the original Oculus Rift CV1), Oculus Quest utilizes an \"inside-out\" tracking system known as \"Oculus Insight\".",

              "[28][29][30] Hand tracking was initially introduced as an experimental feature in December 2019, as part of Quest system software version 12.",

              "[47] Scott Stein of CNET considered the Quest to be \"improbably amazing for its size and $399 price tag\", and compared it to Nintendo Switch in terms of convenience.",
              "Stein praised its camera system and motion controls, and its graphics quality for being nearer to PC-quality than Oculus Go (albeit still limited in detail due to its use of mobile computing hardware).",

              "[48] Adi Robertson of The Verge shared similar opinions, noting that the Quest was heavier and not as comfortable as Rift S, and that its launch titles were not at the same caliber as the PC Oculus Rift in terms of size or graphical fidelity, but that the Quest still included a physical IPD slider unlike the Rift S.",
              "[34] In May 2020, The Verge acknowledged that the Quest had improved since its launch to become \"the closest thing that exists to a sleek, almost mainstream VR headset\", citing an expanding software library, and the ability to use the headset with a PC over USB via the Oculus Link feature (and over Wi-Fi using the sideloaded third-party software Virtual Desktop, which was not \"noticeably worse\" than doing so over USB in their experience).",
              "It was argued that the Quest \"works so well by itself that it's a great system in its own right\", while Oculus Link allowed it to double as a \"credible\" PC VR headset as well.",
              "While it was noted that the Rift S was less front-heavy and that its display \"trades contrast for slightly higher resolution and refresh rate\", it was argued that neither it or the Valve Index \"works as a perfectly good standalone wireless VR headset\".",
              "[49] VentureBeat felt that Oculus was likely \"setting the stage\" for discontinuing the Rift line in favor of Quest, arguing \"if Link performs as expected, most users will have little to no idea of what they're missing \u2014 Rift S' extra camera, FPS, and resolution differences won't matter much.\"",
              "[45] Two weeks after launch, Oculus announced that it had sold $5 million worth of content for the Oculus Quest.",
              "[50] At Oculus Connect 6, it was announced that the Quest had created over 20% of the generated revenue from all platforms at Oculus, totaling at $20 million.",
              "[51][52] It was also reported during the same event that the Quest has by far the highest retention rate of all their headsets.",
              "[53] 317,000 units were sold over the 4th quarter of 2019, and was sold out at times.",

              "Platforms: Valve Index, Oculus Rift, Meta Quest 2, HTC Vive, PSVR, PS VR2 Pistol Whip is yet another VR game that\u2019ll have you ducking and diving, forcing you into a rhythm of shooting enemies and looking cool while doing it.",
              "Well, you probably won\u2019t look half as cool as you think wielding your headset, but you\u2019ll certainly feel like a badass.",
              "The game rewards you for shooting enemies in sync with the accompanying backing track, so I\u2019m not joking when I say that it forces you into a rhythm.",
              "Think Beat Saber, except you\u2019ve got guns and some wacky environments to go wild in.",
              "The unique visuals and distinct colours in Pistol Whip won\u2019t be for everyone, but for those who like the idea of landing headshots in time with a spectacular riff, this is your chance to feel like the main character in an upcoming action movie.",
              "Platforms: Valve Index, Oculus Rift, Meta Quest 2, HTC Vive If what you\u2019re really looking for is chaos - mainly in the form of brute strength and violence - Blade and Sorcery is no doubt the game for you.",
              "On the other hand, however, this game probably isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted who prefer a more laid back experience.",
              "Blade and Sorcery is a medieval-sandbox game specifically built for VR.",
              "As a result, the physics of combat feel incredibly satisfying;",
              "it feels realistic, to an extent, and acts as a great way to blow off some steam.",
              "If you can look past just how brutal you need to be to get far as a warrior, Blade and Sorcery is also full of laughs, too.",
              "Pair this with the extensive modding community, and you\u2019ve got one hell of a game.",

              "Without any spoilers, this is one for fans of puzzles, taking in the environment, and getting to the bottom of a mystery.",
              "There\u2019s no speedy transitions that\u2019ll knock you sick, and the escape-the-room premise of the game does mean that there\u2019s time to step back and take everything in if needed.",
              "Speaking of taking everything in, The Room VR is also full of fascinating visuals and references to the occult that any fan of darker premises will love.",

              "With enough practice, you could probably give Obi-Wan a run for his money.",
              "Platforms: Valve Index, Oculus Rift, Meta Quest 2, HTC Vive, PSVR, PS VR2 Demeo is, to put it simply, a virtual reality clone of Dungeons & Dragons.",

              "Despite this, research focusing on learning outcomes, intervention characteristics, and assessment measures associated with I-VR use has been sparse.",
              "To explore this, the current systematic review examined experimental studies published since 2013, where quantitative learning outcomes using HMD based I-VR were compared with less immersive pedagogical methods such as desktop computers and slideshows.",

              "Only two studies found clear detrimental effects of using I-VR.",
              "However, most studies used short interventions, did not examine information retention, and were focused mainly on the teaching of scientific topics such as biology or physics.",
              "In addition, the MERSQI showed that the methods used to evaluate learning outcomes are often inadequate and this may affect the interpretation of I-VR\u2019s utility.",
              "The review highlights that a rigorous methodological approach through the identification of appropriate assessment measures, intervention characteristics, and learning outcomes is essential to understanding the potential of I-VR as a pedagogical method.",
              "Avoid common mistakes on your manuscript.",
              "The increasing financial feasibility of virtual reality (VR) has allowed for educational institutions to incorporate the technology into their teaching.",
              "According to research, 96% of universities and 79% of colleges in the UK are now utilising augmented or virtual reality in some capacity (UKAuthority 2019).",
              "In addition, the rising power of personal computers and associated hardware has led to a revolution in graphical fidelity, with ever more complex and realistic simulations and virtual worlds (Slater 2018).",
              "As Dickey (2005) alludes to, this has both challenged and expanded the very conceptual definition of what is defined as a learning environment.",
              "Where once this would have been restricted to classroom teaching or field trips, VR\u2019s innate ability to give users a sense of presence and immersion has opened new possibilities in education if implemented appropriately (Ha\u0308fner et al.",
              "2018).",
              "The use of technology-aided education as a pedagogical method is not a modern phenomenon, and investigations into its utility have been studied for almost half a century.",
              "As far back as the 1970s, Ellinger and Frankland (1976) found that the use of early computers to teach economic principles produced comparative learning outcomes with traditional didactic methods such as lectures.",
              "However, as Jensen and Konradsen (2018) allude to, it was with the release of the Oculus Rift in 2013 that VR became synonymous with head-mounted-display (HMD) based VR.",
              "This had several ramifications.",
              "First, HMDs became economically feasible for consumers and educational institutions to acquire en masse, due to a significant drop in price (Hodgson et al.",
              "2015).",
              "As Olmos et al.",
              "(2018) remarks, the economic viability of VR has tackled one of the main entry barriers to adopting the technology.",
              "And secondly, academic research into the potential benefits of I-VR in education starts to expand, as well as its applied use in pedagogical settings (Hodgson et al.",
              "2019).",
              "One of VR\u2019s most important contributions to education is that it has allowed students to repeatedly practice complex and demanding tasks in a safe environment.",
              "This is particularly true of procedural tasks such as surgical operations or dental procedures that cannot be carried out for real until a certain level of competency has been achieved (Alaraj et al.",
              "2011;",
              "Larsen et al.",
              "2012).",
              "Additionally, VR has allowed for students to gain cognitive skills by way of experiential learning, such as exposing them to environments that would be too logistically problematic to visit in reality (C\u0327alis\u0327kan 2011).",
              "For instance, by using a HMD, Bailenson et al.",
              "(2018) were able to expose students to an underwater environment to facilitate learning about climate change.",
              "VR has made an important contribution to education in that it has allowed for students to directly experience environments or situations that are difficult to replicate by using traditional teaching methods such as lectures, slideshows, or 2D videos.",
              "A concise definition of VR\u2019s key characteristics is challenging due to the ever-changing nature of the technology.",
              "However, Sherman and Craig (2003) proposed that there are a number of constituent elements that must underpin the VR experience, ultimately leading to the life-like perception of the virtual environment.",
              "These include the necessity for VR to be immersive, in that the participant\u2019s own cognitive faculties produce a sense of being present and involved in the virtual space, often with reduced awareness of what is happening in the real-world around them.",
              "Additionally, the virtual space should offer a degree of interactivity, in that the user can manipulate the environment and test variables.",
              "This can include interacting with objects, virtual avatars, or even collaborating with other real-life users within the computer-generated space.",
              "Due to the multidisciplinary nature of VR research and its pedagogical applications, it is important to define key terms used.",
              "VR can broadly be broken down into two main categories: desktop VR (D-VR), and immersive-VR (I-VR).",
              "D-VR is typically classified as non-immersive, in that a headset is not used, and the participant will be controlling and manipulating the virtual environment on a computer screen with traditional keyboard and mouse hardware (Lee et al.",
              "2010).",
              "On the other hand, I-VR is typically multi-modal in nature by providing a sense of immersion in the environment through 360\u00b0 visuals by aid of a HMD, auditory stimulation through the use of earphones, and increasingly the proprioception of limbs by way of controllers and tracking (Freina and Ott 2015;",
              "Howard-Jones et al.",
              "2015;",
              "Murcia-Lo\u0301pez and Steed 2016).",
              "Although there are a range of HMDs on the market, from high-end hardware like the HTC Vive, to viable low-cost options like the Google Cardboard, they all utilise the same core principals of operation (Brown and Green 2016).",
              "Typically, a HMD will feature a set of embedded liquid crystal displays (LCD) which will present each eye an image from a slightly different angle.",
              "This mimics natural optic function by allowing the wearer to view a stereoscopic image complete with depth perception and a wide field of view.",
              "Mobile VR headsets can achieve the same effect using a single display by dividing the screen down the middle and presenting each half to the corresponding eye.",
              "Therefore, the current review defines a HMD as a device worn over the head, which provides a stereoscopic computer-generated or 360\u00b0 video image to the user.",
              "This includes tethered (connected to a computer), stand-alone (no computer needed), or mobile VR headsets (mobile/cell phone connected to a HMD).",
              "There have been a number of systematic reviews that have previously explored the relationship between VR and pedagogical attainment.",
              "Lee (1999) reviewed 19 studies from as far back as 1976 and found that 66% of students in simulation groups outperformed those in their respective control groups.",
              "However, this review did not focus exclusively on an educational level or age range, so featured both young kindergarten children, as well as higher education students.",
              "As a result, the generalisability of VR\u2019s effectiveness as a pedagogical method is difficult to ascertain, with significant differences in age, task difficulty, and applications.",
              "Furthermore, all the studies are dated in terms of the technology utilised and feature early D-VR programmes and rudimental computer simulations.",
              "This early technology may be primitive when compared with the high-fidelity graphics and immersive components of contemporary technology.",
              "Nevertheless, these early studies do help exemplify that the use of technology in education is not a new concept, and computer-based simulations have long been employed as a way of facilitating learning.",
              "A more recent analysis was undertaken by Merchant et al.",
              "(2014), and looked at three specific sub-categories of VR: games, simulations, and virtual worlds.",
              "Games give the actor autonomy and freedom to move around the virtual world, testing hypotheses, achieving goals, and eliciting motivation and learning through immersion (Gee 2004).",
              "Simulations attempt to recreate a real-world environment that can help facilitate learning by allowing for the testing of variables and resulting outcomes.",
              "Finally, virtual worlds can provide an immersive or non-immersive sense of presence in a three-dimensional (3D) world, and the ability to manipulate, interact, or construct objects.",
              "Furthermore, virtual worlds can give the opportunity for multiple users to interact with one another within the digital environment (Dickey 2005).",
              "The meta-analysis showed that although game-based VR produced the highest learning outcomes, simulations and virtual worlds were also effective at increasing educational attainment.",
              "Once again, the limitation of this review is that it did not restrict its analysis to exclusively one domain of education.",
              "Although higher education made up the greatest number of studies, research from elementary and middle school were also included in the analysis.",
              "One of the most recent systematic reviews to look exclusively at I-VR through the utilisation of HMDs was carried out by Jensen and Konradsen (2018).",
              "In their comprehensive search of existing literature published between 2013 and 2017, the review identified 21 quantitative and qualitative papers that focused on both learning outcomes in I-VR, and subjective attitudes and experiences on the part of the user.",
              "The review found limited effectiveness of HMD in the acquisition of cognitive, psychomotor, and affective skills when compared with less immersive technologies.",
              "However, Jensen and Konradsen (2018) did highlight the relatively low quality of studies included as a concern, and this may impede the ability to draw firm conclusions about the educational utility of I-VR.",
              "There are several fundamental reasons that necessitate an updated assessment of the topic area, such as the increase in relevant published literature, as well as the narrow scope of previous reviews.",
              "The last major review looking at I-VR and HMDs as an educational tool was carried out by Jensen and Konradsen (2018), with the most recent studies featured in that paper being published in 2016.",
              "Since then, there has been a significant increase in relevant published literature, with > 70% of the papers included in the current review being published since 2017, and therefore not included in the previous systematic review.",
              "Additionally, unlike previous reviews, the current examination of I-VR\u2019s pedagogical utility focuses exclusively on studies where I-VR is directly compared to a less immersive method of learning.",
              "As a result, the current paper is able to highlight not only whether I-VR is an effective medium, but also whether it is more effective when compared to alternative methods.",
              "Additionally, no other systematic review looking at I-VR and HMDs has had a particular focus on the experimental design, assessment measures, and intervention characteristics of the included studies.",
              "The review also addresses the underlying methodology of the included studies, to offer an understanding of how I-VR is being employed in experimental literature.",
              "Based upon the findings of previous studies as well as areas yet to be sufficiently explored, this paper has a number of core research questions: To assess the subject area, discipline, and learning domain that I-VR has been employed in.",
              "Understand where I-VR confers an educational benefit in terms of quantitative learning outcomes over non-immersive and traditional teaching methods.",
              "To examine the experimental design of studies, focusing on how learning outcomes are assessed, and how the I-VR intervention is delivered.",
              "To inform future experimental and applied practice in the field of pedagogical I-VR application.",
              "The current systematic review included peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings that passed all the inclusion criteria detailed.",
              "An initial scoping review identified seven databases that could be utilised in a comprehensive literature review, as well as associated keywords and search terms. These included Web of Science (Core Collection), Science Direct, Sage, IEEE Xplore, EBSCO, Taylor & Francis, and Google Scholar.",
              "These databases encompass a mixture of general, social science, and technological literature.",
              "Each of the seven databases was searched using a series of keywords based on the following Boolean logic string: (\"Virtual Reality\" OR \"Virtual-Reality\" OR \u201cImmersive Virtual Reality\u201d OR \u201cHead Mounted Display\u201d OR \u201cImmersive Simulation\u201d) AND (Education OR Training OR Learning OR Teaching) Due to the scope and parameters of the research objectives, only peer-reviewed literature published between January 2013 and December 2018 was included in the final review.",
              "Early access articles due to be published in 2019 were also included if these were found using the database searches.",
              "Date criteria was based upon an initial scoping review that found a substantial growth in relevant I-VR literature from 2013 onwards.",
              "A major contributing factor was the release of the Oculus Rift Development Kit 1 (DK-1) in early 2013, which is regarded as one of the first economically viable and high quality HMDs that could be used both within educational institutions, and at home (Lyne 2013).",
              "The literature search across the databases yielded more than 12,000 references from a variety of sources.",
              "After the removal of duplicate records, 9,359 unique references were included for the title and abstract screening stage of the review.",
              "The open and general nature of the search string used led to a large number of references being returned for screening.",
              "As Jensen and Konradsen (2018) already alluded to in the last major review, VR research transcends various academic disciplines.",
              "The result is a lack of a clear taxonomy of definitions and terms. This means a wide net must be cast to ensure comprehensive capture of relevant material.",
              "This review defined I-VR as either a completely computer-generated environment, or the viewing of captured 360\u00b0 video through the use of a HMD.",
              "Studies that utilised surgical or dental simulators and trainers such as the da Vinci Surgical System, were excluded as these represent a separate domain of both technological and pedagogical application.",
              "For example, surgical simulation based VR typically combines computer-generated visuals with simulated surgical tools, haptic feedback, and robotic components (Li et al.",
              "2017).",
              "This type of technology would therefore not be applicable for general pedagogical application.",
              "Additionally, references were excluded if they: (1) focused on using I-VR as a rehabilitation or therapeutic tool;",
              "(2) were not in English;",
              "or (3) where the full-text was not available.",
              "After title and abstract screening was performed, 197 references remained to be included in the full-text review.",
              "Each reference had to pass an inclusion flowchart based on each of the following criteria: The population being sampled was from a high school, further or higher education establishment, or was an adult education student.",
              "Population sampled did not have a developmental or neurological condition, nor could VR be used as a rehabilitation tool.",

              "A quantitative and objective learning outcome such as tests scores, completion time, or knowledge retention was used to assess effectiveness.",
              "After full-text screening, 29 references passed all stages and were included in the systematic review.",

              "Stage-by-stage selection process Inter-rater reliability checks were conducted at the title and abstract screening stage to assess the agreement of included studies.",
              "There were four individual evaluators that assessed the suitability of each reference based upon the inclusion criteria, which yielded an average agreement of 96%.",
              "Where any disagreement existed, the paper was discussed among all assessors until a unanimous decision was reached as to its suitability.",
              "To assess the quality of the studies, the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) was used (Reed et al.",
              "2007).",
              "Although this tool was primarily designed to examine the quality of studies in the field of medical education, it is in practice subject neutral.",
              "As the MERSQI assesses not only the quality of experimental design and outcomes measures, but also the assessment instrumentation used, it was viewed as a suitable and comprehensive tool for quality appraisal.",

              "Since the MCQ was most commonly administered immediately after the I-VR experience, much of the information may still be stored in short-term memory, and this may not give an accurate reflection of more comprehensive learning or long-term retention.",

              "So over the last couple of weeks, I've been to four different conferences back-to-back.",
              "It was Facebook F8, to then VR LA, to then Microsoft Build, and then Google I.",
              "O.",
              "And so three of them were developer conferences for Facebook, Microsoft, and Google, and you get different vibes that are happening at each of these different companies.",
              "Facebook tends to be very much like the agencies that are doing these different advertising campaigns for different companies.",
              "So you get a lot of creatives working at agencies as well as a very international flavor of people from all over the world that are using different Facebook products.",
              "And then Microsoft Build was extremely like enterprise centered.",
              "So people who are building applications for the enterprise.",
              "And so they're very serious and very much into solving business problems. VRLA was not a developer conference, but it was a lot of the creatives and people who were in the entertainment industry trying to find like applications for VR that I guess aren't always consumer focused, but there is certainly a consumer focus at VRLA, but that's also just seeing what is possible with the medium and how you can have these different experiences that people want to have in VR.",
              "And then finally, Google was, I guess Google's got a lot of like AI.",
              "And so it's the most decentralized open.",
              "So it's the people who are wanting to make stuff, very much a maker flavor of these different tools that are made available for people to create all sorts of different stuff.",
              "Android as an operating system is diffuse out to all sorts of different technologies all across the entire spectrum of the human experience.",
              "But it tends to also be a lot of artificial intelligence that we're talking about, a lot of tools that they're creating, but also some new stuff within mostly augmented reality, but also they have made an announcement about Google tours for education.",
              "So generally Google tends to be about information and education and just freely distributing stuff.",
              "And they're not always about like, you know, helping you figure out how to actually make a living off of stuff.",
              "It's sort of like, get stuff out there like Google Polly, but there won't be a way for you to sell 3D models, for example.",
              "It's like the tools to be able to freely share stuff, but it's a little less focused on the economic models of everything.",
              "Like something like YouTube, for example, you can create whatever you want and you can use their advertising to be able to make a living.",
              "And I think that's kind of generally how Android is.",
              "It's very decentralized.",
              "It's like, hey, here are the tools to make cool stuff.",
              "Go figure it out and make stuff.",
              "And if you can make a living off of it, that's great.",
              "So the education, though, I think is one of the areas where it is actually great to be able to have this freely accessible repositories of different stuff, especially for teachers who don't have a lot of budget.",
              "And so the Google Expeditions has actually been, I think, of all the other different entities and projects that are within the VR space, Google Expeditions is the most robust when it comes to thinking about like, what is VR education going to look like?",
              "They've been creating these different expeditions and they just launched a new tool called the Virtual Tours, where you're able to essentially either take a Ricoh Theta camera, take 360 photos and annotate them and then bundle them all up and put them onto Google Polly.",
              "Or if even if you don't have a 360 camera, you can take a street view capture of a scene and then be able to take that and start to annotate it as well.",
              "And so creating these virtual tours are going to enable people to create these guided tours anywhere on the planet and be able to share them on Google Poly that then can be ingested into these headsets.",
              "So I talked to a couple of people who were on the Google Expeditions team, as well as the product managers, VR, AR, working on some of these different products, including Blocks and Poly, as well as these virtual tours.",
              "So that's what we'll be covering on today's episode of the Voices of VR podcast.",
              "So this interview with Britt and Jennifer happened on Wednesday, May 9th, 2018 at the Google I-O conference in Mountain View, California.",
              "So with that, let's go ahead and dive right in.",
              "[00:04:09.",
              "463] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, I'm Jennifer Holland, and I am the program manager for Expeditions, as well as Tour Creator, and work across both AR and VR, as well as G Suite for Education.",
              "[00:04:20.",
              "591] Brit Mennuti: And I'm Britt Manute.",
              "I'm a product manager on the Google AR and VR team.",
              "And I focus on building tools to help make it easier to create content for AR and VR, so Blocks, Poly, and Torque Creator.",
              "[00:04:31.",
              "161] Kent Bye: OK, great.",
              "So there's been some new announcements about this tour creator, but also there's a presentation that you gave today just kind of giving an update as to what's happening with education and virtual reality.",
              "And so there's been a lot of stuff with K-12 education, but maybe you could talk a bit about some of the things that you were talking about, what's happening and what's new with education and VR with the Google Expeditions.",
              "[00:04:52.",
              "330] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, so since we last talked a year ago, a lot has happened.",
              "We brought Expeditions to over 3 million students around the globe, specifically through the Pioneer program, which has been really exciting.",
              "We have also had over 6 million app downloads with Expeditions, which we're really excited about.",
              "We're seeing lots of teachers and students use our content every day in their classroom to create these immersive experiences.",
              "We have over 800 new expeditions.",
              "And later this month, which we announced today, we'll be actually releasing our app with an AR functionality within it.",
              "So you'll have AR and VR tours, which is really exciting.",
              "And then the other big announcement that we made actually is two.",
              "One is we've been working with a company called Labster, which is a science education company in Denmark, to basically unlock the physical lab requirements to complete an online biology degree using virtual reality.",
              "So there are 30 labs that really do advanced simulations using mathematical equations and really have real world outcomes and can be supplemented both with existing curriculum or you can complete it completely online.",
              "And that content is also very relevant for K-12 schools because the VR labs themselves map to AP and IB courses.",
              "So we're seeing schools interested in supplementing their existing lab programs, or schools that really financially don't have the resources to create labs, be able to offer a full laboratory using the Labster VR labs.",
              "And then Brit has been working, we've been working together to launch a new product called Tour Creator.",
              "So it was really, you know, the initial idea came out of expeditions of teachers wanting to be able to create their own immersive experiences.",
              "Students wanted to be able to use it as a tool for their own projects.",
              "But we quickly realized that there was broader opportunity, and so Brit can talk more about that.",
              "I appreciate that.",
              "[00:06:40.",
              "498] Brit Mennuti: Yeah, so in the same way that VR can aid in understanding inside the classroom, we realized that the same sort of concept could apply outside the classroom and often in the business world.",
              "So a great example is real estate.",
              "Like, you know, when you're buying a house, for instance, you think about referencing things like photos, brochures, pamphlets, floor plans, and those are all sort of like abstract representations of the actual thing.",
              "And so we thought to ourselves, well, wouldn't it be better if you could actually be immersed in a virtual version of a house before you committed to purchasing it or committing to go see it?",
              "And so we figured that things like expeditions could be useful to other applications.",
              "So that includes things like real estate, enterprise training.",
              "We're seeing airlines, like KLM Airlines, use the tool to create training content so that their flight crew gets sort of familiar with the aircraft before they even set foot inside of it.",
              "And then other applications just in lifestyle and tourism and travel.",
              "So Time Out New York has been making amazing tours of all the greatest spots all over New York City, like the New York Public Library and Central Park.",
              "We're working with a company called Imagine It Done that helps people organize their lives in their closets and they're using it to showcase their expertise to potential clients.",
              "So we're seeing broad applications across a whole bunch of use cases.",
              "[00:07:49.",
              "267] Kent Bye: Yeah, and in terms of the Labster experiences, when I saw that, you know, I had been in chemistry classes in both in high school and college, and I know there's labs and they're trying to essentially recreate that lab experience for you to be able to actually experiment with doing these different combinations.",
              "Are these like generally available or do you have to be kind of like signed up to one of the courses in order to get access to some of this content?",
              "[00:08:11.",
              "350] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, I mean, no, Labster has an app on the Play Store.",
              "And so you can go on, and if you're interested and a biology enthusiast, you can go through and complete the VR labs.",
              "And their labs also work on Chrome as well.",
              "So you don't get the immersive experience like you do with VR, but they also do have Chrome labs as well.",
              "[00:08:29.",
              "987] Kent Bye: OK, and a lot of the other Google Expeditions also have the ability for people to share, well, who is actually creating these different modules and be able to put these lessons up on Google Expeditions?",
              "Is this something that teachers can create themselves and be able to share amongst each other?",
              "Or is that kind of a curated list of people who are creating these?",
              "[00:08:48.",
              "563] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, so when we started creating our expeditions, it was actually pretty difficult.",
              "Like, we looked back, my team had to figure out how to do it.",
              "And what we wanted to do is create enough tours so that teachers could really add it to their existing curriculum, you know, be able to incorporate it in a variety of subjects.",
              "We now have a growing library of over 800 tours, which we're really proud of.",
              "And we're seeing those tours used across different subjects and grades.",
              "And, you know, a lot of the same tours are used in multiple variations, which is exciting.",
              "With Tour Creator, we're really putting it in the hands of teachers and students.",
              "So they can, you know, capture their own 360 images, or they can use the corpus of Street View to really create their own tours and These tours from these schools and these kids is awesome.",
              "I mean, they are showing their communities why they love where they live.",
              "You really get to understand.",
              "We went to Penn Manor in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and learned all about farming and milking a cow, which is not something that we get to do in New York City.",
              "or schools in Bali getting to see what their school looks like.",
              "So it's been an amazing tool for students to show each other where they come from in their communities, which I think is something really important that we've strived for.",
              "And then you'll eventually be able to experience these tours as a guided experience in the Expeditions app.",
              "Right now, that feature doesn't exist, but it's something that we're adding.",
              "And so an individual can published to Poly and view it right on Poly, or they can use that embed code and put it on a school website.",
              "[00:10:17.",
              "356] Kent Bye: Yeah, so Britt, you were walking through the workflow for how to create one of these tours, and I saw that they were just using a Ricoh Theta camera, so being able to actually take the 360 photo, and then having a web app to be able to go in, and I don't know if that Theta has a GPS corresponding to it, or you have to kind of locate it on the map, essentially geolocating it so then you can put it to where it's at in space but also go in and start to tag different dimensions of what's happening in that scene.",
              "And so maybe you could just sort of step through like that workflow of like being able to do all that and then how it's like published on Poly.",
              "[00:10:51.",
              "106] Brit Mennuti: Yeah, sure.",
              "So when you start with your tour, you essentially start with some basic metadata.",
              "So you give it a title, a description.",
              "You choose a category.",
              "We have tons of categories on Poly that apply to these types of tours.",
              "And you add a cover photo.",
              "And then you fill it with scenes.",
              "And the scenes can be your own 360 photos.",
              "So if you do have a 360 camera, that's great.",
              "You can easily upload them.",
              "But if you don't, we're actually directly integrated with Street View.",
              "And so what this means is you can actually just type in an address.",
              "And we'll pull up the relevant 360 photo that we have in Google Maps.",
              "And you can use that as your scene.",
              "So essentially, even if you don't have a 360 camera, you have the power to create your own VR content with this tool.",
              "Once you add your scenes, you add what we call points of interest.",
              "These are basically areas within the scene of importance that you want to highlight.",
              "You can add a little bit of text information to those points of interest, and you can also upload some rich media on top of them.",
              "So things like 2D images.",
              "And in the future, we'll have things like narration and ambient audio, which we found to be really important in terms of VR to make the user feel like they're really actually there.",
              "And then you publish your tour to the web, to Polly.",
              "Polly is Google's library for 3D content.",
              "We launched it last year.",
              "And previously, Polly has things like 3D models, 3D sketches from Tilt Brush.",
              "But now, we'll also include 3D experiences in the form of these tours.",
              "And the beautiful thing about publishing to Poly is that we're taking advantage of WebXR.",
              "So what this means is that with only a URL, you can actually experience that content in VR in any VR headset without having to install any sort of application.",
              "So it's a really beautiful melding together of different Google technologies.",
              "[00:12:21.",
              "005] Kent Bye: Now, I imagine that there's a lot of people who, you know, make a living off of giving tours and they may want to create these, but it seems like at this point it's kind of an educational thing.",
              "It's Creative Commons.",
              "People are sharing it openly.",
              "But do you imagine that people would somehow be able to get paid for creating some of these?",
              "Or if there's like a mechanism by either you pay up front or just maybe have some sort of like donation afterwards or something just to be able to take it to the next level?",
              "[00:12:46.",
              "501] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, I mean, We wanted to create a tool that was accessible, right?",
              "And we've done that.",
              "And so we're excited to see how this tool is going to be used in the future.",
              "We definitely see broad application with enterprise companies wanting to do it.",
              "I can imagine a lot of people specializing and being able to create really compelling and beautiful tours and really be able to create a whole business around it.",
              "So we would be thrilled with that and seeing that demand.",
              "But we just launched today, so it's a little early.",
              "[00:13:16.",
              "195] Brit Mennuti: One other thing I'll say, too, is in advance of launching the product, we partnered with local guides, which are a whole bunch of folks who are really big enthusiasts with Google Maps.",
              "And they go around, they write reviews, and they make Google Maps a really content-rich experience.",
              "And a lot of these local guides are actually photographers.",
              "And so they take a lot of 360 photos for a living.",
              "And they've been using Tour Creator as a way to showcase their material.",
              "Another beautiful thing about the product is that if you do use somebody's 360 photo, let's say you pay them for it, you can actually give them credit.",
              "And we transfer those credits, you write them into the tool, we transfer them over to Poly.",
              "So when you view that tour on Poly, you'll actually get to see all the photographers that contributed to it.",
              "So I think it's a really great way for somebody to actually showcase their ability, especially in a field like 360 photography, which is a little bit more nascent than traditional photography.",
              "[00:14:02.",
              "042] Kent Bye: And talking to the Google Earth VR engineers, there's a number of different features that have, like, you know, KLM files to be able to do what was essentially replicating all of this functionality of the photos and the annotations and the, like, is there any plans to eventually kind of, like, merge a lot of this functionality into something like Google Earth VR?",
              "So if you wanted to just zoom around and see if there was specific expeditions, that that could be your web browser rather than going through something like Poly.",
              "It's something that's much more geospatially oriented where you can just discover some of these places that may have guided tours there.",
              "[00:14:37.",
              "119] Jennifer Holland: It's a great idea.",
              "If you want to see that, you should submit a feature.",
              "Consider it submitted.",
              "We as a team want to find more integrations and work with one another.",
              "Obviously, Tour Creator with Poly is that extension and working with Expeditions.",
              "And so we'd welcome the opportunity to work with the Google Earth team.",
              "[00:14:56.",
              "933] Kent Bye: Okay.",
              "And there was also, you know, speaking of Google Earth, there was a mention of how there's a specific process to take some of the Google Earth data and be able to put it into Expeditions.",
              "I guess it's with the Surat.",
              "You know, what is happening there to be able to take the complexity of that data and to be able to make it available for something that could be seen on a mobile VR headset?",
              "[00:15:16.",
              "637] Jennifer Holland: So it's using this rot tool to be able to basically, it's almost like you can take a cylinder of any point within an earth scene, and we have a couple of tours that we've done that with.",
              "We don't have, I think we have like six or eight of those right now, and they're really beautiful.",
              "They're high quality, they're 3D, and they really, I mean, you feel like you're there in a really neat way.",
              "And a lot of ways that with Google Jump and you get that 3D perspective with the 360 photos and video, you get that with Serat.",
              "And so we're still experimenting.",
              "It's like really early.",
              "It's taken us a little bit of time to put those tours together, but it's something that we want to create more.",
              "[00:15:54.",
              "541] Kent Bye: With there was also like a best buy like I guess it was like a whole cart of immersive media thing to add both Virtuality augmented reality maybe you could talk a bit about like what some of these Carts are for teachers to be able to essentially create the AV cart that has all these immersive technologies.",
              "I [00:16:12.",
              "980] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, so Best Buy for Education has been an awesome partner and one of ours from the early days of Expeditions.",
              "And what they provide is a whole kit for school to be able to get going using Expeditions.",
              "The beauty of Expeditions is that one works without the internet.",
              "and we create a local network so the guide can bring students throughout each of the panels but doesn't require the school Wi-Fi which can be pretty constrained.",
              "And it also works on a variety of different devices.",
              "So even if you don't have an Expeditions kit like Best Buy, you can use your tablet both on Android and iOS, your mobile device.",
              "And so we're seeing a lot of applications for teachers being able to use Expeditions, but without a cart.",
              "Now schools that have purchased a cart, it's been great.",
              "It's usually like a shared device.",
              "There are different models, but 10, 20, 30 devices, depending on what the school purchases.",
              "It comes with a VR headset.",
              "And now with the AR functionality coming, they'll have mobile devices that do AR and VR, which is the ASUS ZenFone.",
              "And it has a selfie stick, which we actually found early on, people laughed at us, like, you know, what are you having these kids take selfies?",
              "Turns out the selfie stick's actually a great way for an AR experience, because their fingers don't, you know, hit the different buttons on the phone and crash out of the app.",
              "And so it allows them to, you know, get up close, take a step back, and get a sense of the scale.",
              "And also, you know, just keeps things in check.",
              "So Best Buy is going to start selling the AR and VR kit, which has phones, the viewers, the router, the teacher tablet, and the selfie sticks.",
              "[00:17:45.",
              "112] Kent Bye: And there seemed to be a theme of moving from the abstractions of language and text and moving into like concrete experiences that are both direct experiences, but they're immersed into the these scenes.",
              "So I'm curious to hear some of the feedback or metrics that you're looking at to reassure yourself that this is a path that is both working and sort of worth continuing and growing.",
              "[00:18:05.",
              "590] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, we rely 100% on teacher and student feedback.",
              "That's honestly what drives what we work on.",
              "I'm a former teacher.",
              "Ben, my colleague, is a former teacher.",
              "And for us, even though we haven't been in the classroom for a while, it's really important that we work alongside teachers and students to make sure that what we're building is actually useful.",
              "One of the metrics that we look at is how much training time is needed for teachers to be able to use the technology.",
              "As a former teacher, if I have to spend hours learning how to use the technology and then it breaks right when I get going, that's not useful, especially when you have 30 students looking right at you waiting for something to happen.",
              "So for us, making sure that we bring that barrier down to make it really easy and seamless to use in the classroom is number one priority.",
              "We want teachers to feel confident with the technology.",
              "We don't want you to have to spend hours upon hours in professional development training, learning how to use those tools.",
              "The other piece is we want school to be fun and engaging.",
              "And the feedback that we've gotten from teachers, I mean, all you have to do is go on Twitter and look at hashtag Google Expeditions, and you will just see magic happening in the classroom.",
              "We've had teachers write to us.",
              "I mean, we get so many letters from students and teachers about just the experience of what it was like to bring Expeditions into their classroom.",
              "And, you know, teachers who have been at it for a long time and have been teaching the lessons, you know, with slight nuances have been totally blown away with the level of engagement and excitement for the technology.",
              "And the nice thing about it is it hasn't been the technology that's been the exciting piece.",
              "It's the experience.",
              "And many of them cite that as, you know, their students are able to go so much deeper with the material because they visually have an understanding of what's happening.",
              "So much of learning is an abstraction for students, and they're having to put these mental models together in order to understand a theory or a concept.",
              "With AR and VR, it immediately, you fast forward a bit, and a student already has that mental model, and now can focus on what the teacher's actually trying to teach them, which is like the theory, and how it applies.",
              "And, I mean, a fifth grader said it best.",
              "He was like, you know, I don't have to assemble this mental model of what my teacher's asking.",
              "I can see it, and now I can focus on what it means.",
              "And that's what learning is about.",
              "And sparking that level of curiosity and excitement for learning is really what we're after.",
              "[00:20:19.",
              "409] Kent Bye: So what's next?",
              "What are some of the biggest problems you're trying to solve or questions that you're trying to answer?",
              "[00:20:26.",
              "253] Jennifer Holland: I mean, we want to keep building.",
              "Today, I'm like, well, we just launched a tour creator.",
              "I think we're really excited to see what the world does with this tool.",
              "And, you know, for us on the education side, it's exciting because we're now putting that creation tool in the power of students, which is You always want your students to be able to create stuff.",
              "And I think we're also equally excited to see how businesses and consumers, I imagine, will see a lot of family tours and vacations, which is exciting.",
              "Especially having a new son myself, being able to go back in time and look at some of those moments is pretty powerful.",
              "We're excited to see where that takes us and just being able to offer more and more experiences like this.",
              "[00:21:07.",
              "313] Brit Mennuti: Yeah, I think another thing that I'm particularly excited about is seeing what new use cases for the tool of Tor Creator that people have that we haven't thought of yet.",
              "As a product manager who worked on blocks, when we originally conceived of blocks, we thought that people would use it to model just singular 3D objects.",
              "And what actually happened is that people were creating entire 3D VR scenes with this product.",
              "And that was not something we ever envisioned would happen, but we were so glad it did because it gave us a new understanding for where the product could go in the future.",
              "I think the same could be true of Tour Creator.",
              "So we'll see what people do with these different photos, how they annotate them, how they add different media to them, the applications they use them for, and there'll perhaps be new opportunities for us to expand the product.",
              "[00:21:48.",
              "090] Jennifer Holland: I'll just say we take feedback very seriously, which I know you know.",
              "And we ask everybody to just submit feedback using that send feedback button.",
              "We read every single piece of feedback and we respond.",
              "So if there are things that are missing or you want certain features, please let us know because that's how we decide what to build next.",
              "[00:22:06.",
              "765] Kent Bye: Great.",
              "And finally, what do you each think is the ultimate potential of virtual and augmented reality and what it might be able to enable?",
              "[00:22:16.",
              "533] Jennifer Holland: I'm just really excited about just making learning more accessible.",
              "You can imagine some of the most brilliant teachers and professors being able to offer experiences and students be able to leverage the technology to create experiences that would otherwise be impossible.",
              "[00:22:33.",
              "767] Brit Mennuti: My background is partially in business and partially in fine arts.",
              "And one of the things that I'm super stoked about in terms of AR and VR is it's a whole new medium for artists to actually express themselves and for people who maybe don't consider themselves artists to find a new way to express themselves.",
              "So even seeing teachers and students create expeditions, it's a marvelous thing to see them be creative.",
              "So I'm looking forward to seeing how this industry moves forward in terms of creative expression.",
              "[00:22:57.",
              "566] Kent Bye: All right.",
              "Awesome.",
              "Well, thank you so much for joining me today.",
              "[00:23:01.",
              "209] Jennifer Holland: Thanks for having us.",
              "Thanks.",
              "[00:23:03.",
              "240] Kent Bye: So, that was Jennifer Holland.",
              "She's a program manager for the Expeditions and Tour Creator on the ARVR team, as well as Brent Minuti, who's a product manager on the ARVR team working on Blocks, Poly, and Tour Creator.",
              "So, I have a number of different takeaways about this interview is that, first of all, generally, Google tends to be all about information and knowledge, and They're trying to capture all of the information in the world and be able to present it to you.",
              "And I think that when it comes to education, it's a natural fit for Google to start to take what's essentially a knowledge graph and figure out all these different tools to be able to translate that knowledge graph into these different educational experiences.",
              "So this is actually one of the areas that I think that I'm the most excited about for where this goes for Google, especially if there's some uptake when it comes to teachers.",
              "I think access to the technology is probably one of the biggest barriers to be able to actually deploy these out into the classrooms. And so it sounds like they have some partnerships with people like Best Buy that have these, what's essentially like an AV cart with a bunch of phones that are AR enabled as well as these VR headsets.",
              "So once the technology is in the hands of these teachers, then one of the things that, you know, when I was at the IEEE VR back in 2017, I had a chance to go to a K through 12 education workshop, which actually had some people from Google that were presenting some of their research findings.",
              "And what they found is that it's actually better to just create a generic experience of some sort of like concept without trying to specify it for any specific audience.",
              "And so You want to be able to take what's essentially like an experience, a visual metaphor of some concept, and then be able to use it for first graders and fifth graders and high school.",
              "And it's kind of, in some sense, independent for the grade level, because if it's specified at the grade level, then they will only use it for that grade level.",
              "The thing about VR and AR is that you can create these generalized experiences and that they can create this direct experience of some of these concepts so that you've in some ways be able to set the primary metaphors that are going to allow you to understand these mental models and these different maps of different dimensions of reality.",
              "So there's these different category schemas in our mind that are essentially like these buckets and categories to be able to file information to.",
              "And so a thing about VR is that it gives you the spatial metaphor that really creates these buckets in your brain in a way that can categorize information that is so much more effective than just talking about the abstract construct without having any sort of context for it.",
              "So I think VR is going to have this huge application, especially when it comes to these concepts of embodied cognition.",
              "You're going to be able to have a direct experience of something.",
              "You're going to sort of get the overview of these concepts.",
              "And then the teacher is going to be able to share these larger concepts about these ideas.",
              "Or also what has been happening with a lot of these things is that the students start to teach each other.",
              "And so the student becomes a teacher to other people.",
              "As they figure something out, then they get to share that to other people.",
              "The selfie sticks seems to be a way that you're able to both get this increased level of embodiment I know last year at Google IO some of the demos that they were showing they were using these selfie sticks and you're able to just get this deep sense of presence of that I don't know there was something about being able to have it far away from your face and be able to walk around that allowed you to have more of a clear window into these augmented reality worlds and so I it sounds like that a lot of these tools are going to be launching with AR features as well and so they're going to be leveraging a lot of these aspects of ARCore that are kind of built into some of these phones and that you know to a certain extent I think that AR may be a little bit better and easier for these educational applications just because once a student goes unveiled within a VR headset then it's difficult to have a social interaction with them at that point and that so much of the learning is socially constructed and seeing what other people are saying and that if it's in AR, then you have a little bit better of a social cohesion within a group of students.",
              "So I expect that a lot of these educational things will be in AR first for these groups and areas, but there will actually be some topics that you will need to want to have the full immersion of the virtual reality.",
              "And I think the virtual tours are also very exciting to see where this goes, and to have this pipeline within Poly.",
              "It was originally just to kind of share these blocks and Tilt Brush, but what Britt Manute said was that people started to essentially upload these entire scenes, and so they kind of took that as a sign that they can start to you know, take these entire virtual tours, put a 360 photo in there and start to annotate it and have like different audio and basically create an audio tour with this stack of web tools, essentially, so that you can upload it to Poly and then you get this URL.",
              "And once you have the URL, then that can be sent around.",
              "And that is something that you could use to target these different applications that can load dynamically.",
              "And you don't have to necessarily download a specific app.",
              "although I think you know one of the things that they try to create with the Google expeditions was to Create it so that if you do have like really poor Wi-Fi or for you completely off the grid Then you can still be able to pre download stuff beforehand and then be able to share it to the students So I'm not sure exactly how that's gonna work with the you know URLs and be able to dynamically load stuff But it sounds like they're creating a system so that it can work both online and offline I asked about what kind of business models they have in terms of whether you'll be able to sell these types of things.",
              "And talking to different VR artists, one of the feedback they have for Poly is that, well, it'd be really nice if you can actually sell some of my models that I'm creating here.",
              "They have Creative Commons integration, which is awesome and great.",
              "And that is really encouraging the ability to essentially create these open repositories of art that people are creating from a user-generated perspective, but have a mechanism by which they can share them out and have people just use them.",
              "you're able to contribute to this larger repository of educational experiences that can be created if you create something to put up on Polly, either through Tilt Brush or through Blocks.",
              "But at the same time, Google at the launch didn't launch with something where they had the store mindset in mind.",
              "It wasn't a top priority for them to make it available for the creators to be able to make a living off of this.",
              "It just wasn't a top priority in their minimum viable product.",
              "And it also just generally, as Google does, they sort of put things out there and let you kind of figure it out on your own.",
              "It's kind of like YouTube is a decentralized platform where, you know, if you get to the point where you get a huge audience and people actually clicking on ads, then you can really make a go of it as a living.",
              "But at that point, then you kind of become susceptible to the whims of the algorithm for the ads.",
              "And so It's kind of like this interesting dynamic where Google is enabling a lot of people to create all this stuff, but at the same time, the economic models to really make it fully sustainable, I think, is something that, without thinking about that, we'll see how far it can really go.",
              "It's basically relying upon people's free labor to be able to generate these different types of educational products, which is great if you want to help support these types of educational experiences.",
              "But if you want to make a huge living off of it, then I think it's something where you have to find other revenue streams or grants or ways to really sustain yourself in doing that.",
              "So, that's all that I have for today, and I just wanted to thank you for listening to the Voices of VR podcast, and if you enjoy the podcast, then please do spread the word, tell your friends, and consider becoming a member of the Patreon.",

              "Hello, my name is Kent Bye, and welcome to the Voices of VR podcast.",
              "So over the last couple of weeks, I've been to four different conferences back-to-back.",
              "It was Facebook F8, to then VR LA, to then Microsoft Build, and then Google I.",
              "O.",
              "And so three of them were developer conferences for Facebook, Microsoft, and Google, and you get different vibes that are happening at each of these different companies.",
              "Facebook tends to be very much like the agencies that are doing these different advertising campaigns for different companies.",
              "So you get a lot of creatives working at agencies as well as a very international flavor of people from all over the world that are using different Facebook products.",

              "So people who are building applications for the enterprise.",
              "And so they're very serious and very much into solving business problems. VRLA was not a developer conference, but it was a lot of the creatives and people who were in the entertainment industry trying to find like applications for VR that I guess aren't always consumer focused, but there is certainly a consumer focus at VRLA, but that's also just seeing what is possible with the medium and how you can have these different experiences that people want to have in VR.",
              "And then finally, Google was, I guess Google's got a lot of like AI.",
              "And so it's the most decentralized open.",
              "So it's the people who are wanting to make stuff, very much a maker flavor of these different tools that are made available for people to create all sorts of different stuff.",
              "Android as an operating system is diffuse out to all sorts of different technologies all across the entire spectrum of the human experience.",
              "But it tends to also be a lot of artificial intelligence that we're talking about, a lot of tools that they're creating, but also some new stuff within mostly augmented reality, but also they have made an announcement about Google tours for education.",
              "So generally Google tends to be about information and education and just freely distributing stuff.",
              "And they're not always about like, you know, helping you figure out how to actually make a living off of stuff.",
              "It's sort of like, get stuff out there like Google Polly, but there won't be a way for you to sell 3D models, for example.",
              "It's like the tools to be able to freely share stuff, but it's a little less focused on the economic models of everything.",
              "Like something like YouTube, for example, you can create whatever you want and you can use their advertising to be able to make a living.",
              "And I think that's kind of generally how Android is.",
              "It's very decentralized.",
              "It's like, hey, here are the tools to make cool stuff.",
              "Go figure it out and make stuff.",
              "And if you can make a living off of it, that's great.",
              "So the education, though, I think is one of the areas where it is actually great to be able to have this freely accessible repositories of different stuff, especially for teachers who don't have a lot of budget.",
              "And so the Google Expeditions has actually been, I think, of all the other different entities and projects that are within the VR space, Google Expeditions is the most robust when it comes to thinking about like, what is VR education going to look like?",
              "They've been creating these different expeditions and they just launched a new tool called the Virtual Tours, where you're able to essentially either take a Ricoh Theta camera, take 360 photos and annotate them and then bundle them all up and put them onto Google Polly.",
              "Or if even if you don't have a 360 camera, you can take a street view capture of a scene and then be able to take that and start to annotate it as well.",
              "And so creating these virtual tours are going to enable people to create these guided tours anywhere on the planet and be able to share them on Google Poly that then can be ingested into these headsets.",
              "So I talked to a couple of people who were on the Google Expeditions team, as well as the product managers, VR, AR, working on some of these different products, including Blocks and Poly, as well as these virtual tours.",
              "So that's what we'll be covering on today's episode of the Voices of VR podcast.",
              "So this interview with Britt and Jennifer happened on Wednesday, May 9th, 2018 at the Google I-O conference in Mountain View, California.",
              "So with that, let's go ahead and dive right in.",
              "[00:04:09.",

              "161] Kent Bye: OK, great.",
              "So there's been some new announcements about this tour creator, but also there's a presentation that you gave today just kind of giving an update as to what's happening with education and virtual reality.",
              "And so there's been a lot of stuff with K-12 education, but maybe you could talk a bit about some of the things that you were talking about, what's happening and what's new with education and VR with the Google Expeditions.",
              "[00:04:52.",
              "330] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, so since we last talked a year ago, a lot has happened.",
              "We brought Expeditions to over 3 million students around the globe, specifically through the Pioneer program, which has been really exciting.",
              "We have also had over 6 million app downloads with Expeditions, which we're really excited about.",
              "We're seeing lots of teachers and students use our content every day in their classroom to create these immersive experiences.",
              "We have over 800 new expeditions.",
              "And later this month, which we announced today, we'll be actually releasing our app with an AR functionality within it.",
              "So you'll have AR and VR tours, which is really exciting.",
              "And then the other big announcement that we made actually is two.",
              "One is we've been working with a company called Labster, which is a science education company in Denmark, to basically unlock the physical lab requirements to complete an online biology degree using virtual reality.",
              "So there are 30 labs that really do advanced simulations using mathematical equations and really have real world outcomes and can be supplemented both with existing curriculum or you can complete it completely online.",
              "And that content is also very relevant for K-12 schools because the VR labs themselves map to AP and IB courses.",
              "So we're seeing schools interested in supplementing their existing lab programs, or schools that really financially don't have the resources to create labs, be able to offer a full laboratory using the Labster VR labs.",
              "And then Brit has been working, we've been working together to launch a new product called Tour Creator.",
              "So it was really, you know, the initial idea came out of expeditions of teachers wanting to be able to create their own immersive experiences.",
              "Students wanted to be able to use it as a tool for their own projects.",
              "But we quickly realized that there was broader opportunity, and so Brit can talk more about that.",
              "I appreciate that.",
              "[00:06:40.",
              "498] Brit Mennuti: Yeah, so in the same way that VR can aid in understanding inside the classroom, we realized that the same sort of concept could apply outside the classroom and often in the business world.",
              "So a great example is real estate.",
              "Like, you know, when you're buying a house, for instance, you think about referencing things like photos, brochures, pamphlets, floor plans, and those are all sort of like abstract representations of the actual thing.",
              "And so we thought to ourselves, well, wouldn't it be better if you could actually be immersed in a virtual version of a house before you committed to purchasing it or committing to go see it?",
              "And so we figured that things like expeditions could be useful to other applications.",
              "So that includes things like real estate, enterprise training.",
              "We're seeing airlines, like KLM Airlines, use the tool to create training content so that their flight crew gets sort of familiar with the aircraft before they even set foot inside of it.",
              "And then other applications just in lifestyle and tourism and travel.",
              "So Time Out New York has been making amazing tours of all the greatest spots all over New York City, like the New York Public Library and Central Park.",
              "We're working with a company called Imagine It Done that helps people organize their lives in their closets and they're using it to showcase their expertise to potential clients.",
              "So we're seeing broad applications across a whole bunch of use cases.",
              "[00:07:49.",
              "267] Kent Bye: Yeah, and in terms of the Labster experiences, when I saw that, you know, I had been in chemistry classes in both in high school and college, and I know there's labs and they're trying to essentially recreate that lab experience for you to be able to actually experiment with doing these different combinations.",
              "Are these like generally available or do you have to be kind of like signed up to one of the courses in order to get access to some of this content?",
              "[00:08:11.",
              "350] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, I mean, no, Labster has an app on the Play Store.",
              "And so you can go on, and if you're interested and a biology enthusiast, you can go through and complete the VR labs.",
              "And their labs also work on Chrome as well.",
              "So you don't get the immersive experience like you do with VR, but they also do have Chrome labs as well.",
              "[00:08:29.",
              "987] Kent Bye: OK, and a lot of the other Google Expeditions also have the ability for people to share, well, who is actually creating these different modules and be able to put these lessons up on Google Expeditions?",
              "Is this something that teachers can create themselves and be able to share amongst each other?",
              "Or is that kind of a curated list of people who are creating these?",
              "[00:08:48.",
              "563] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, so when we started creating our expeditions, it was actually pretty difficult.",
              "Like, we looked back, my team had to figure out how to do it.",
              "And what we wanted to do is create enough tours so that teachers could really add it to their existing curriculum, you know, be able to incorporate it in a variety of subjects.",
              "We now have a growing library of over 800 tours, which we're really proud of.",
              "And we're seeing those tours used across different subjects and grades.",
              "And, you know, a lot of the same tours are used in multiple variations, which is exciting.",
              "With Tour Creator, we're really putting it in the hands of teachers and students.",
              "So they can, you know, capture their own 360 images, or they can use the corpus of Street View to really create their own tours and These tours from these schools and these kids is awesome.",
              "I mean, they are showing their communities why they love where they live.",
              "You really get to understand.",
              "We went to Penn Manor in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and learned all about farming and milking a cow, which is not something that we get to do in New York City.",
              "or schools in Bali getting to see what their school looks like.",
              "So it's been an amazing tool for students to show each other where they come from in their communities, which I think is something really important that we've strived for.",
              "And then you'll eventually be able to experience these tours as a guided experience in the Expeditions app.",
              "Right now, that feature doesn't exist, but it's something that we're adding.",
              "And so an individual can published to Poly and view it right on Poly, or they can use that embed code and put it on a school website.",
              "[00:10:17.",
              "356] Kent Bye: Yeah, so Britt, you were walking through the workflow for how to create one of these tours, and I saw that they were just using a Ricoh Theta camera, so being able to actually take the 360 photo, and then having a web app to be able to go in, and I don't know if that Theta has a GPS corresponding to it, or you have to kind of locate it on the map, essentially geolocating it so then you can put it to where it's at in space but also go in and start to tag different dimensions of what's happening in that scene.",
              "And so maybe you could just sort of step through like that workflow of like being able to do all that and then how it's like published on Poly.",
              "[00:10:51.",
              "106] Brit Mennuti: Yeah, sure.",
              "So when you start with your tour, you essentially start with some basic metadata.",
              "So you give it a title, a description.",
              "You choose a category.",
              "We have tons of categories on Poly that apply to these types of tours.",
              "And you add a cover photo.",
              "And then you fill it with scenes.",
              "And the scenes can be your own 360 photos.",
              "So if you do have a 360 camera, that's great.",
              "You can easily upload them.",
              "But if you don't, we're actually directly integrated with Street View.",
              "And so what this means is you can actually just type in an address.",
              "And we'll pull up the relevant 360 photo that we have in Google Maps.",
              "And you can use that as your scene.",
              "So essentially, even if you don't have a 360 camera, you have the power to create your own VR content with this tool.",
              "Once you add your scenes, you add what we call points of interest.",
              "These are basically areas within the scene of importance that you want to highlight.",
              "You can add a little bit of text information to those points of interest, and you can also upload some rich media on top of them.",
              "So things like 2D images.",
              "And in the future, we'll have things like narration and ambient audio, which we found to be really important in terms of VR to make the user feel like they're really actually there.",
              "And then you publish your tour to the web, to Polly.",
              "Polly is Google's library for 3D content.",
              "We launched it last year.",
              "And previously, Polly has things like 3D models, 3D sketches from Tilt Brush.",
              "But now, we'll also include 3D experiences in the form of these tours.",
              "And the beautiful thing about publishing to Poly is that we're taking advantage of WebXR.",
              "So what this means is that with only a URL, you can actually experience that content in VR in any VR headset without having to install any sort of application.",
              "So it's a really beautiful melding together of different Google technologies.",
              "[00:12:21.",
              "005] Kent Bye: Now, I imagine that there's a lot of people who, you know, make a living off of giving tours and they may want to create these, but it seems like at this point it's kind of an educational thing.",
              "It's Creative Commons.",
              "People are sharing it openly.",
              "But do you imagine that people would somehow be able to get paid for creating some of these?",
              "Or if there's like a mechanism by either you pay up front or just maybe have some sort of like donation afterwards or something just to be able to take it to the next level?",
              "[00:12:46.",
              "501] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, I mean, We wanted to create a tool that was accessible, right?",
              "And we've done that.",
              "And so we're excited to see how this tool is going to be used in the future.",
              "We definitely see broad application with enterprise companies wanting to do it.",
              "I can imagine a lot of people specializing and being able to create really compelling and beautiful tours and really be able to create a whole business around it.",
              "So we would be thrilled with that and seeing that demand.",
              "But we just launched today, so it's a little early.",
              "[00:13:16.",
              "195] Brit Mennuti: One other thing I'll say, too, is in advance of launching the product, we partnered with local guides, which are a whole bunch of folks who are really big enthusiasts with Google Maps.",
              "And they go around, they write reviews, and they make Google Maps a really content-rich experience.",
              "And a lot of these local guides are actually photographers.",
              "And so they take a lot of 360 photos for a living.",
              "And they've been using Tour Creator as a way to showcase their material.",
              "Another beautiful thing about the product is that if you do use somebody's 360 photo, let's say you pay them for it, you can actually give them credit.",
              "And we transfer those credits, you write them into the tool, we transfer them over to Poly.",
              "So when you view that tour on Poly, you'll actually get to see all the photographers that contributed to it.",
              "So I think it's a really great way for somebody to actually showcase their ability, especially in a field like 360 photography, which is a little bit more nascent than traditional photography.",
              "[00:14:02.",
              "042] Kent Bye: And talking to the Google Earth VR engineers, there's a number of different features that have, like, you know, KLM files to be able to do what was essentially replicating all of this functionality of the photos and the annotations and the, like, is there any plans to eventually kind of, like, merge a lot of this functionality into something like Google Earth VR?",
              "So if you wanted to just zoom around and see if there was specific expeditions, that that could be your web browser rather than going through something like Poly.",
              "It's something that's much more geospatially oriented where you can just discover some of these places that may have guided tours there.",
              "[00:14:37.",
              "119] Jennifer Holland: It's a great idea.",
              "If you want to see that, you should submit a feature.",
              "Consider it submitted.",
              "We as a team want to find more integrations and work with one another.",
              "Obviously, Tour Creator with Poly is that extension and working with Expeditions.",
              "And so we'd welcome the opportunity to work with the Google Earth team.",
              "[00:14:56.",
              "933] Kent Bye: Okay.",
              "And there was also, you know, speaking of Google Earth, there was a mention of how there's a specific process to take some of the Google Earth data and be able to put it into Expeditions.",
              "I guess it's with the Surat.",
              "You know, what is happening there to be able to take the complexity of that data and to be able to make it available for something that could be seen on a mobile VR headset?",
              "[00:15:16.",
              "637] Jennifer Holland: So it's using this rot tool to be able to basically, it's almost like you can take a cylinder of any point within an earth scene, and we have a couple of tours that we've done that with.",
              "We don't have, I think we have like six or eight of those right now, and they're really beautiful.",
              "They're high quality, they're 3D, and they really, I mean, you feel like you're there in a really neat way.",
              "And a lot of ways that with Google Jump and you get that 3D perspective with the 360 photos and video, you get that with Serat.",
              "And so we're still experimenting.",
              "It's like really early.",
              "It's taken us a little bit of time to put those tours together, but it's something that we want to create more.",
              "[00:15:54.",
              "541] Kent Bye: With there was also like a best buy like I guess it was like a whole cart of immersive media thing to add both Virtuality augmented reality maybe you could talk a bit about like what some of these Carts are for teachers to be able to essentially create the AV cart that has all these immersive technologies.",
              "I [00:16:12.",
              "980] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, so Best Buy for Education has been an awesome partner and one of ours from the early days of Expeditions.",
              "And what they provide is a whole kit for school to be able to get going using Expeditions.",
              "The beauty of Expeditions is that one works without the internet.",
              "and we create a local network so the guide can bring students throughout each of the panels but doesn't require the school Wi-Fi which can be pretty constrained.",
              "And it also works on a variety of different devices.",
              "So even if you don't have an Expeditions kit like Best Buy, you can use your tablet both on Android and iOS, your mobile device.",
              "And so we're seeing a lot of applications for teachers being able to use Expeditions, but without a cart.",
              "Now schools that have purchased a cart, it's been great.",
              "It's usually like a shared device.",
              "There are different models, but 10, 20, 30 devices, depending on what the school purchases.",
              "It comes with a VR headset.",
              "And now with the AR functionality coming, they'll have mobile devices that do AR and VR, which is the ASUS ZenFone.",
              "And it has a selfie stick, which we actually found early on, people laughed at us, like, you know, what are you having these kids take selfies?",
              "Turns out the selfie stick's actually a great way for an AR experience, because their fingers don't, you know, hit the different buttons on the phone and crash out of the app.",
              "And so it allows them to, you know, get up close, take a step back, and get a sense of the scale.",
              "And also, you know, just keeps things in check.",
              "So Best Buy is going to start selling the AR and VR kit, which has phones, the viewers, the router, the teacher tablet, and the selfie sticks.",
              "[00:17:45.",
              "112] Kent Bye: And there seemed to be a theme of moving from the abstractions of language and text and moving into like concrete experiences that are both direct experiences, but they're immersed into the these scenes.",
              "So I'm curious to hear some of the feedback or metrics that you're looking at to reassure yourself that this is a path that is both working and sort of worth continuing and growing.",
              "[00:18:05.",
              "590] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, we rely 100% on teacher and student feedback.",
              "That's honestly what drives what we work on.",
              "I'm a former teacher.",
              "Ben, my colleague, is a former teacher.",
              "And for us, even though we haven't been in the classroom for a while, it's really important that we work alongside teachers and students to make sure that what we're building is actually useful.",
              "One of the metrics that we look at is how much training time is needed for teachers to be able to use the technology.",
              "As a former teacher, if I have to spend hours learning how to use the technology and then it breaks right when I get going, that's not useful, especially when you have 30 students looking right at you waiting for something to happen.",
              "So for us, making sure that we bring that barrier down to make it really easy and seamless to use in the classroom is number one priority.",
              "We want teachers to feel confident with the technology.",
              "We don't want you to have to spend hours upon hours in professional development training, learning how to use those tools.",
              "The other piece is we want school to be fun and engaging.",
              "And the feedback that we've gotten from teachers, I mean, all you have to do is go on Twitter and look at hashtag Google Expeditions, and you will just see magic happening in the classroom.",
              "We've had teachers write to us.",
              "I mean, we get so many letters from students and teachers about just the experience of what it was like to bring Expeditions into their classroom.",
              "And, you know, teachers who have been at it for a long time and have been teaching the lessons, you know, with slight nuances have been totally blown away with the level of engagement and excitement for the technology.",
              "And the nice thing about it is it hasn't been the technology that's been the exciting piece.",
              "It's the experience.",
              "And many of them cite that as, you know, their students are able to go so much deeper with the material because they visually have an understanding of what's happening.",
              "So much of learning is an abstraction for students, and they're having to put these mental models together in order to understand a theory or a concept.",
              "With AR and VR, it immediately, you fast forward a bit, and a student already has that mental model, and now can focus on what the teacher's actually trying to teach them, which is like the theory, and how it applies.",
              "And, I mean, a fifth grader said it best.",
              "He was like, you know, I don't have to assemble this mental model of what my teacher's asking.",
              "I can see it, and now I can focus on what it means.",
              "And that's what learning is about.",
              "And sparking that level of curiosity and excitement for learning is really what we're after.",
              "[00:20:19.",
              "409] Kent Bye: So what's next?",
              "What are some of the biggest problems you're trying to solve or questions that you're trying to answer?",
              "[00:20:26.",
              "253] Jennifer Holland: I mean, we want to keep building.",
              "Today, I'm like, well, we just launched a tour creator.",
              "I think we're really excited to see what the world does with this tool.",
              "And, you know, for us on the education side, it's exciting because we're now putting that creation tool in the power of students, which is You always want your students to be able to create stuff.",
              "And I think we're also equally excited to see how businesses and consumers, I imagine, will see a lot of family tours and vacations, which is exciting.",
              "Especially having a new son myself, being able to go back in time and look at some of those moments is pretty powerful.",
              "We're excited to see where that takes us and just being able to offer more and more experiences like this.",
              "[00:21:07.",
              "313] Brit Mennuti: Yeah, I think another thing that I'm particularly excited about is seeing what new use cases for the tool of Tor Creator that people have that we haven't thought of yet.",
              "As a product manager who worked on blocks, when we originally conceived of blocks, we thought that people would use it to model just singular 3D objects.",
              "And what actually happened is that people were creating entire 3D VR scenes with this product.",
              "And that was not something we ever envisioned would happen, but we were so glad it did because it gave us a new understanding for where the product could go in the future.",
              "I think the same could be true of Tour Creator.",
              "So we'll see what people do with these different photos, how they annotate them, how they add different media to them, the applications they use them for, and there'll perhaps be new opportunities for us to expand the product.",
              "[00:21:48.",
              "090] Jennifer Holland: I'll just say we take feedback very seriously, which I know you know.",
              "And we ask everybody to just submit feedback using that send feedback button.",
              "We read every single piece of feedback and we respond.",
              "So if there are things that are missing or you want certain features, please let us know because that's how we decide what to build next.",
              "[00:22:06.",
              "765] Kent Bye: Great.",
              "And finally, what do you each think is the ultimate potential of virtual and augmented reality and what it might be able to enable?",
              "[00:22:16.",
              "533] Jennifer Holland: I'm just really excited about just making learning more accessible.",
              "You can imagine some of the most brilliant teachers and professors being able to offer experiences and students be able to leverage the technology to create experiences that would otherwise be impossible.",
              "[00:22:33.",
              "767] Brit Mennuti: My background is partially in business and partially in fine arts.",
              "And one of the things that I'm super stoked about in terms of AR and VR is it's a whole new medium for artists to actually express themselves and for people who maybe don't consider themselves artists to find a new way to express themselves.",
              "So even seeing teachers and students create expeditions, it's a marvelous thing to see them be creative.",
              "So I'm looking forward to seeing how this industry moves forward in terms of creative expression.",
              "[00:22:57.",
              "566] Kent Bye: All right.",
              "Awesome.",
              "Well, thank you so much for joining me today.",
              "[00:23:01.",
              "209] Jennifer Holland: Thanks for having us.",
              "Thanks.",
              "[00:23:03.",
              "240] Kent Bye: So, that was Jennifer Holland.",
              "She's a program manager for the Expeditions and Tour Creator on the ARVR team, as well as Brent Minuti, who's a product manager on the ARVR team working on Blocks, Poly, and Tour Creator.",
              "So, I have a number of different takeaways about this interview is that, first of all, generally, Google tends to be all about information and knowledge, and They're trying to capture all of the information in the world and be able to present it to you.",
              "And I think that when it comes to education, it's a natural fit for Google to start to take what's essentially a knowledge graph and figure out all these different tools to be able to translate that knowledge graph into these different educational experiences.",
              "So this is actually one of the areas that I think that I'm the most excited about for where this goes for Google, especially if there's some uptake when it comes to teachers.",
              "I think access to the technology is probably one of the biggest barriers to be able to actually deploy these out into the classrooms. And so it sounds like they have some partnerships with people like Best Buy that have these, what's essentially like an AV cart with a bunch of phones that are AR enabled as well as these VR headsets.",
              "So once the technology is in the hands of these teachers, then one of the things that, you know, when I was at the IEEE VR back in 2017, I had a chance to go to a K through 12 education workshop, which actually had some people from Google that were presenting some of their research findings.",
              "And what they found is that it's actually better to just create a generic experience of some sort of like concept without trying to specify it for any specific audience.",
              "And so You want to be able to take what's essentially like an experience, a visual metaphor of some concept, and then be able to use it for first graders and fifth graders and high school.",
              "And it's kind of, in some sense, independent for the grade level, because if it's specified at the grade level, then they will only use it for that grade level.",
              "The thing about VR and AR is that you can create these generalized experiences and that they can create this direct experience of some of these concepts so that you've in some ways be able to set the primary metaphors that are going to allow you to understand these mental models and these different maps of different dimensions of reality.",
              "So there's these different category schemas in our mind that are essentially like these buckets and categories to be able to file information to.",
              "And so a thing about VR is that it gives you the spatial metaphor that really creates these buckets in your brain in a way that can categorize information that is so much more effective than just talking about the abstract construct without having any sort of context for it.",
              "So I think VR is going to have this huge application, especially when it comes to these concepts of embodied cognition.",
              "You're going to be able to have a direct experience of something.",
              "You're going to sort of get the overview of these concepts.",
              "And then the teacher is going to be able to share these larger concepts about these ideas.",
              "Or also what has been happening with a lot of these things is that the students start to teach each other.",
              "And so the student becomes a teacher to other people.",
              "As they figure something out, then they get to share that to other people.",
              "The selfie sticks seems to be a way that you're able to both get this increased level of embodiment I know last year at Google IO some of the demos that they were showing they were using these selfie sticks and you're able to just get this deep sense of presence of that I don't know there was something about being able to have it far away from your face and be able to walk around that allowed you to have more of a clear window into these augmented reality worlds and so I it sounds like that a lot of these tools are going to be launching with AR features as well and so they're going to be leveraging a lot of these aspects of ARCore that are kind of built into some of these phones and that you know to a certain extent I think that AR may be a little bit better and easier for these educational applications just because once a student goes unveiled within a VR headset then it's difficult to have a social interaction with them at that point and that so much of the learning is socially constructed and seeing what other people are saying and that if it's in AR, then you have a little bit better of a social cohesion within a group of students.",
              "So I expect that a lot of these educational things will be in AR first for these groups and areas, but there will actually be some topics that you will need to want to have the full immersion of the virtual reality.",
              "And I think the virtual tours are also very exciting to see where this goes, and to have this pipeline within Poly.",
              "It was originally just to kind of share these blocks and Tilt Brush, but what Britt Manute said was that people started to essentially upload these entire scenes, and so they kind of took that as a sign that they can start to you know, take these entire virtual tours, put a 360 photo in there and start to annotate it and have like different audio and basically create an audio tour with this stack of web tools, essentially, so that you can upload it to Poly and then you get this URL.",
              "And once you have the URL, then that can be sent around.",
              "And that is something that you could use to target these different applications that can load dynamically.",
              "And you don't have to necessarily download a specific app.",
              "although I think you know one of the things that they try to create with the Google expeditions was to Create it so that if you do have like really poor Wi-Fi or for you completely off the grid Then you can still be able to pre download stuff beforehand and then be able to share it to the students So I'm not sure exactly how that's gonna work with the you know URLs and be able to dynamically load stuff But it sounds like they're creating a system so that it can work both online and offline I asked about what kind of business models they have in terms of whether you'll be able to sell these types of things.",
              "And talking to different VR artists, one of the feedback they have for Poly is that, well, it'd be really nice if you can actually sell some of my models that I'm creating here.",
              "They have Creative Commons integration, which is awesome and great.",
              "And that is really encouraging the ability to essentially create these open repositories of art that people are creating from a user-generated perspective, but have a mechanism by which they can share them out and have people just use them.",
              "you're able to contribute to this larger repository of educational experiences that can be created if you create something to put up on Polly, either through Tilt Brush or through Blocks.",
              "But at the same time, Google at the launch didn't launch with something where they had the store mindset in mind.",
              "It wasn't a top priority for them to make it available for the creators to be able to make a living off of this.",
              "It just wasn't a top priority in their minimum viable product.",
              "And it also just generally, as Google does, they sort of put things out there and let you kind of figure it out on your own.",
              "It's kind of like YouTube is a decentralized platform where, you know, if you get to the point where you get a huge audience and people actually clicking on ads, then you can really make a go of it as a living.",
              "But at that point, then you kind of become susceptible to the whims of the algorithm for the ads.",
              "And so It's kind of like this interesting dynamic where Google is enabling a lot of people to create all this stuff, but at the same time, the economic models to really make it fully sustainable, I think, is something that, without thinking about that, we'll see how far it can really go.",
              "It's basically relying upon people's free labor to be able to generate these different types of educational products, which is great if you want to help support these types of educational experiences.",
              "But if you want to make a huge living off of it, then I think it's something where you have to find other revenue streams or grants or ways to really sustain yourself in doing that.",
              "So, that's all that I have for today, and I just wanted to thank you for listening to the Voices of VR podcast, and if you enjoy the podcast, then please do spread the word, tell your friends, and consider becoming a member of the Patreon.",

              "Hello, my name is Kent Bye, and welcome to the Voices of VR podcast.",
              "So over the last couple of weeks, I've been to four different conferences back-to-back.",
              "It was Facebook F8, to then VR LA, to then Microsoft Build, and then Google I.",
              "O.",
              "And so three of them were developer conferences for Facebook, Microsoft, and Google, and you get different vibes that are happening at each of these different companies.",
              "Facebook tends to be very much like the agencies that are doing these different advertising campaigns for different companies.",
              "So you get a lot of creatives working at agencies as well as a very international flavor of people from all over the world that are using different Facebook products.",
              "And then Microsoft Build was extremely like enterprise centered.",
              "So people who are building applications for the enterprise.",
              "And so they're very serious and very much into solving business problems. VRLA was not a developer conference, but it was a lot of the creatives and people who were in the entertainment industry trying to find like applications for VR that I guess aren't always consumer focused, but there is certainly a consumer focus at VRLA, but that's also just seeing what is possible with the medium and how you can have these different experiences that people want to have in VR.",
              "And then finally, Google was, I guess Google's got a lot of like AI.",
              "And so it's the most decentralized open.",
              "So it's the people who are wanting to make stuff, very much a maker flavor of these different tools that are made available for people to create all sorts of different stuff.",
              "Android as an operating system is diffuse out to all sorts of different technologies all across the entire spectrum of the human experience.",
              "But it tends to also be a lot of artificial intelligence that we're talking about, a lot of tools that they're creating, but also some new stuff within mostly augmented reality, but also they have made an announcement about Google tours for education.",
              "So generally Google tends to be about information and education and just freely distributing stuff.",
              "And they're not always about like, you know, helping you figure out how to actually make a living off of stuff.",
              "It's sort of like, get stuff out there like Google Polly, but there won't be a way for you to sell 3D models, for example.",
              "It's like the tools to be able to freely share stuff, but it's a little less focused on the economic models of everything.",
              "Like something like YouTube, for example, you can create whatever you want and you can use their advertising to be able to make a living.",
              "And I think that's kind of generally how Android is.",
              "It's very decentralized.",
              "It's like, hey, here are the tools to make cool stuff.",
              "Go figure it out and make stuff.",
              "And if you can make a living off of it, that's great.",
              "So the education, though, I think is one of the areas where it is actually great to be able to have this freely accessible repositories of different stuff, especially for teachers who don't have a lot of budget.",
              "And so the Google Expeditions has actually been, I think, of all the other different entities and projects that are within the VR space, Google Expeditions is the most robust when it comes to thinking about like, what is VR education going to look like?",
              "They've been creating these different expeditions and they just launched a new tool called the Virtual Tours, where you're able to essentially either take a Ricoh Theta camera, take 360 photos and annotate them and then bundle them all up and put them onto Google Polly.",
              "Or if even if you don't have a 360 camera, you can take a street view capture of a scene and then be able to take that and start to annotate it as well.",
              "And so creating these virtual tours are going to enable people to create these guided tours anywhere on the planet and be able to share them on Google Poly that then can be ingested into these headsets.",
              "So I talked to a couple of people who were on the Google Expeditions team, as well as the product managers, VR, AR, working on some of these different products, including Blocks and Poly, as well as these virtual tours.",

              "161] Kent Bye: OK, great.",
              "So there's been some new announcements about this tour creator, but also there's a presentation that you gave today just kind of giving an update as to what's happening with education and virtual reality.",
              "And so there's been a lot of stuff with K-12 education, but maybe you could talk a bit about some of the things that you were talking about, what's happening and what's new with education and VR with the Google Expeditions.",
              "[00:04:52.",
              "330] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, so since we last talked a year ago, a lot has happened.",
              "We brought Expeditions to over 3 million students around the globe, specifically through the Pioneer program, which has been really exciting.",
              "We have also had over 6 million app downloads with Expeditions, which we're really excited about.",
              "We're seeing lots of teachers and students use our content every day in their classroom to create these immersive experiences.",
              "We have over 800 new expeditions.",
              "And later this month, which we announced today, we'll be actually releasing our app with an AR functionality within it.",
              "So you'll have AR and VR tours, which is really exciting.",
              "And then the other big announcement that we made actually is two.",
              "One is we've been working with a company called Labster, which is a science education company in Denmark, to basically unlock the physical lab requirements to complete an online biology degree using virtual reality.",
              "So there are 30 labs that really do advanced simulations using mathematical equations and really have real world outcomes and can be supplemented both with existing curriculum or you can complete it completely online.",
              "And that content is also very relevant for K-12 schools because the VR labs themselves map to AP and IB courses.",
              "So we're seeing schools interested in supplementing their existing lab programs, or schools that really financially don't have the resources to create labs, be able to offer a full laboratory using the Labster VR labs.",
              "And then Brit has been working, we've been working together to launch a new product called Tour Creator.",
              "So it was really, you know, the initial idea came out of expeditions of teachers wanting to be able to create their own immersive experiences.",
              "Students wanted to be able to use it as a tool for their own projects.",
              "But we quickly realized that there was broader opportunity, and so Brit can talk more about that.",
              "I appreciate that.",
              "[00:06:40.",
              "498] Brit Mennuti: Yeah, so in the same way that VR can aid in understanding inside the classroom, we realized that the same sort of concept could apply outside the classroom and often in the business world.",
              "So a great example is real estate.",
              "Like, you know, when you're buying a house, for instance, you think about referencing things like photos, brochures, pamphlets, floor plans, and those are all sort of like abstract representations of the actual thing.",
              "And so we thought to ourselves, well, wouldn't it be better if you could actually be immersed in a virtual version of a house before you committed to purchasing it or committing to go see it?",
              "And so we figured that things like expeditions could be useful to other applications.",
              "So that includes things like real estate, enterprise training.",
              "We're seeing airlines, like KLM Airlines, use the tool to create training content so that their flight crew gets sort of familiar with the aircraft before they even set foot inside of it.",
              "And then other applications just in lifestyle and tourism and travel.",
              "So Time Out New York has been making amazing tours of all the greatest spots all over New York City, like the New York Public Library and Central Park.",
              "We're working with a company called Imagine It Done that helps people organize their lives in their closets and they're using it to showcase their expertise to potential clients.",
              "So we're seeing broad applications across a whole bunch of use cases.",
              "[00:07:49.",
              "267] Kent Bye: Yeah, and in terms of the Labster experiences, when I saw that, you know, I had been in chemistry classes in both in high school and college, and I know there's labs and they're trying to essentially recreate that lab experience for you to be able to actually experiment with doing these different combinations.",
              "Are these like generally available or do you have to be kind of like signed up to one of the courses in order to get access to some of this content?",
              "[00:08:11.",
              "350] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, I mean, no, Labster has an app on the Play Store.",
              "And so you can go on, and if you're interested and a biology enthusiast, you can go through and complete the VR labs.",
              "And their labs also work on Chrome as well.",
              "So you don't get the immersive experience like you do with VR, but they also do have Chrome labs as well.",
              "[00:08:29.",
              "987] Kent Bye: OK, and a lot of the other Google Expeditions also have the ability for people to share, well, who is actually creating these different modules and be able to put these lessons up on Google Expeditions?",
              "Is this something that teachers can create themselves and be able to share amongst each other?",
              "Or is that kind of a curated list of people who are creating these?",
              "[00:08:48.",
              "563] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, so when we started creating our expeditions, it was actually pretty difficult.",
              "Like, we looked back, my team had to figure out how to do it.",
              "And what we wanted to do is create enough tours so that teachers could really add it to their existing curriculum, you know, be able to incorporate it in a variety of subjects.",
              "We now have a growing library of over 800 tours, which we're really proud of.",
              "And we're seeing those tours used across different subjects and grades.",
              "And, you know, a lot of the same tours are used in multiple variations, which is exciting.",
              "With Tour Creator, we're really putting it in the hands of teachers and students.",
              "So they can, you know, capture their own 360 images, or they can use the corpus of Street View to really create their own tours and These tours from these schools and these kids is awesome.",
              "I mean, they are showing their communities why they love where they live.",
              "You really get to understand.",
              "We went to Penn Manor in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and learned all about farming and milking a cow, which is not something that we get to do in New York City.",
              "or schools in Bali getting to see what their school looks like.",
              "So it's been an amazing tool for students to show each other where they come from in their communities, which I think is something really important that we've strived for.",
              "And then you'll eventually be able to experience these tours as a guided experience in the Expeditions app.",
              "Right now, that feature doesn't exist, but it's something that we're adding.",
              "And so an individual can published to Poly and view it right on Poly, or they can use that embed code and put it on a school website.",
              "[00:10:17.",
              "356] Kent Bye: Yeah, so Britt, you were walking through the workflow for how to create one of these tours, and I saw that they were just using a Ricoh Theta camera, so being able to actually take the 360 photo, and then having a web app to be able to go in, and I don't know if that Theta has a GPS corresponding to it, or you have to kind of locate it on the map, essentially geolocating it so then you can put it to where it's at in space but also go in and start to tag different dimensions of what's happening in that scene.",
              "And so maybe you could just sort of step through like that workflow of like being able to do all that and then how it's like published on Poly.",
              "[00:10:51.",
              "106] Brit Mennuti: Yeah, sure.",
              "So when you start with your tour, you essentially start with some basic metadata.",
              "So you give it a title, a description.",
              "You choose a category.",
              "We have tons of categories on Poly that apply to these types of tours.",
              "And you add a cover photo.",
              "And then you fill it with scenes.",
              "And the scenes can be your own 360 photos.",
              "So if you do have a 360 camera, that's great.",
              "You can easily upload them.",
              "But if you don't, we're actually directly integrated with Street View.",
              "And so what this means is you can actually just type in an address.",
              "And we'll pull up the relevant 360 photo that we have in Google Maps.",
              "And you can use that as your scene.",
              "So essentially, even if you don't have a 360 camera, you have the power to create your own VR content with this tool.",
              "Once you add your scenes, you add what we call points of interest.",
              "These are basically areas within the scene of importance that you want to highlight.",
              "You can add a little bit of text information to those points of interest, and you can also upload some rich media on top of them.",
              "So things like 2D images.",
              "And in the future, we'll have things like narration and ambient audio, which we found to be really important in terms of VR to make the user feel like they're really actually there.",
              "And then you publish your tour to the web, to Polly.",
              "Polly is Google's library for 3D content.",
              "We launched it last year.",
              "And previously, Polly has things like 3D models, 3D sketches from Tilt Brush.",
              "But now, we'll also include 3D experiences in the form of these tours.",
              "And the beautiful thing about publishing to Poly is that we're taking advantage of WebXR.",
              "So what this means is that with only a URL, you can actually experience that content in VR in any VR headset without having to install any sort of application.",
              "So it's a really beautiful melding together of different Google technologies.",
              "[00:12:21.",
              "005] Kent Bye: Now, I imagine that there's a lot of people who, you know, make a living off of giving tours and they may want to create these, but it seems like at this point it's kind of an educational thing.",
              "It's Creative Commons.",
              "People are sharing it openly.",
              "But do you imagine that people would somehow be able to get paid for creating some of these?",
              "Or if there's like a mechanism by either you pay up front or just maybe have some sort of like donation afterwards or something just to be able to take it to the next level?",
              "[00:12:46.",
              "501] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, I mean, We wanted to create a tool that was accessible, right?",
              "And we've done that.",
              "And so we're excited to see how this tool is going to be used in the future.",
              "We definitely see broad application with enterprise companies wanting to do it.",
              "I can imagine a lot of people specializing and being able to create really compelling and beautiful tours and really be able to create a whole business around it.",
              "So we would be thrilled with that and seeing that demand.",
              "But we just launched today, so it's a little early.",
              "[00:13:16.",
              "195] Brit Mennuti: One other thing I'll say, too, is in advance of launching the product, we partnered with local guides, which are a whole bunch of folks who are really big enthusiasts with Google Maps.",
              "And they go around, they write reviews, and they make Google Maps a really content-rich experience.",
              "And a lot of these local guides are actually photographers.",
              "And so they take a lot of 360 photos for a living.",
              "And they've been using Tour Creator as a way to showcase their material.",
              "Another beautiful thing about the product is that if you do use somebody's 360 photo, let's say you pay them for it, you can actually give them credit.",
              "And we transfer those credits, you write them into the tool, we transfer them over to Poly.",
              "So when you view that tour on Poly, you'll actually get to see all the photographers that contributed to it.",
              "So I think it's a really great way for somebody to actually showcase their ability, especially in a field like 360 photography, which is a little bit more nascent than traditional photography.",
              "[00:14:02.",
              "042] Kent Bye: And talking to the Google Earth VR engineers, there's a number of different features that have, like, you know, KLM files to be able to do what was essentially replicating all of this functionality of the photos and the annotations and the, like, is there any plans to eventually kind of, like, merge a lot of this functionality into something like Google Earth VR?",
              "So if you wanted to just zoom around and see if there was specific expeditions, that that could be your web browser rather than going through something like Poly.",
              "It's something that's much more geospatially oriented where you can just discover some of these places that may have guided tours there.",
              "[00:14:37.",
              "119] Jennifer Holland: It's a great idea.",
              "If you want to see that, you should submit a feature.",
              "Consider it submitted.",
              "We as a team want to find more integrations and work with one another.",
              "Obviously, Tour Creator with Poly is that extension and working with Expeditions.",
              "And so we'd welcome the opportunity to work with the Google Earth team.",
              "[00:14:56.",
              "933] Kent Bye: Okay.",
              "And there was also, you know, speaking of Google Earth, there was a mention of how there's a specific process to take some of the Google Earth data and be able to put it into Expeditions.",
              "I guess it's with the Surat.",
              "You know, what is happening there to be able to take the complexity of that data and to be able to make it available for something that could be seen on a mobile VR headset?",
              "[00:15:16.",
              "637] Jennifer Holland: So it's using this rot tool to be able to basically, it's almost like you can take a cylinder of any point within an earth scene, and we have a couple of tours that we've done that with.",
              "We don't have, I think we have like six or eight of those right now, and they're really beautiful.",
              "They're high quality, they're 3D, and they really, I mean, you feel like you're there in a really neat way.",
              "And a lot of ways that with Google Jump and you get that 3D perspective with the 360 photos and video, you get that with Serat.",
              "And so we're still experimenting.",
              "It's like really early.",
              "It's taken us a little bit of time to put those tours together, but it's something that we want to create more.",
              "[00:15:54.",
              "541] Kent Bye: With there was also like a best buy like I guess it was like a whole cart of immersive media thing to add both Virtuality augmented reality maybe you could talk a bit about like what some of these Carts are for teachers to be able to essentially create the AV cart that has all these immersive technologies.",
              "I [00:16:12.",
              "980] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, so Best Buy for Education has been an awesome partner and one of ours from the early days of Expeditions.",
              "And what they provide is a whole kit for school to be able to get going using Expeditions.",
              "The beauty of Expeditions is that one works without the internet.",
              "and we create a local network so the guide can bring students throughout each of the panels but doesn't require the school Wi-Fi which can be pretty constrained.",
              "And it also works on a variety of different devices.",
              "So even if you don't have an Expeditions kit like Best Buy, you can use your tablet both on Android and iOS, your mobile device.",
              "And so we're seeing a lot of applications for teachers being able to use Expeditions, but without a cart.",
              "Now schools that have purchased a cart, it's been great.",
              "It's usually like a shared device.",
              "There are different models, but 10, 20, 30 devices, depending on what the school purchases.",
              "It comes with a VR headset.",
              "And now with the AR functionality coming, they'll have mobile devices that do AR and VR, which is the ASUS ZenFone.",
              "And it has a selfie stick, which we actually found early on, people laughed at us, like, you know, what are you having these kids take selfies?",
              "Turns out the selfie stick's actually a great way for an AR experience, because their fingers don't, you know, hit the different buttons on the phone and crash out of the app.",
              "And so it allows them to, you know, get up close, take a step back, and get a sense of the scale.",
              "And also, you know, just keeps things in check.",
              "So Best Buy is going to start selling the AR and VR kit, which has phones, the viewers, the router, the teacher tablet, and the selfie sticks.",
              "[00:17:45.",
              "112] Kent Bye: And there seemed to be a theme of moving from the abstractions of language and text and moving into like concrete experiences that are both direct experiences, but they're immersed into the these scenes.",
              "So I'm curious to hear some of the feedback or metrics that you're looking at to reassure yourself that this is a path that is both working and sort of worth continuing and growing.",
              "[00:18:05.",
              "590] Jennifer Holland: Yeah, we rely 100% on teacher and student feedback.",
              "That's honestly what drives what we work on.",
              "I'm a former teacher.",
              "Ben, my colleague, is a former teacher.",
              "And for us, even though we haven't been in the classroom for a while, it's really important that we work alongside teachers and students to make sure that what we're building is actually useful.",
              "One of the metrics that we look at is how much training time is needed for teachers to be able to use the technology.",
              "As a former teacher, if I have to spend hours learning how to use the technology and then it breaks right when I get going, that's not useful, especially when you have 30 students looking right at you waiting for something to happen.",
              "So for us, making sure that we bring that barrier down to make it really easy and seamless to use in the classroom is number one priority.",
              "We want teachers to feel confident with the technology.",
              "We don't want you to have to spend hours upon hours in professional development training, learning how to use those tools.",
              "The other piece is we want school to be fun and engaging.",
              "And the feedback that we've gotten from teachers, I mean, all you have to do is go on Twitter and look at hashtag Google Expeditions, and you will just see magic happening in the classroom.",
              "We've had teachers write to us.",
              "I mean, we get so many letters from students and teachers about just the experience of what it was like to bring Expeditions into their classroom.",
              "And, you know, teachers who have been at it for a long time and have been teaching the lessons, you know, with slight nuances have been totally blown away with the level of engagement and excitement for the technology.",
              "And the nice thing about it is it hasn't been the technology that's been the exciting piece.",
              "It's the experience.",
              "And many of them cite that as, you know, their students are able to go so much deeper with the material because they visually have an understanding of what's happening.",
              "So much of learning is an abstraction for students, and they're having to put these mental models together in order to understand a theory or a concept.",
              "With AR and VR, it immediately, you fast forward a bit, and a student already has that mental model, and now can focus on what the teacher's actually trying to teach them, which is like the theory, and how it applies.",
              "And, I mean, a fifth grader said it best.",
              "He was like, you know, I don't have to assemble this mental model of what my teacher's asking.",
              "I can see it, and now I can focus on what it means.",
              "And that's what learning is about.",
              "And sparking that level of curiosity and excitement for learning is really what we're after.",
              "[00:20:19.",
              "409] Kent Bye: So what's next?",
              "What are some of the biggest problems you're trying to solve or questions that you're trying to answer?",
              "[00:20:26.",
              "253] Jennifer Holland: I mean, we want to keep building.",
              "Today, I'm like, well, we just launched a tour creator.",
              "I think we're really excited to see what the world does with this tool.",
              "And, you know, for us on the education side, it's exciting because we're now putting that creation tool in the power of students, which is You always want your students to be able to create stuff.",
              "And I think we're also equally excited to see how businesses and consumers, I imagine, will see a lot of family tours and vacations, which is exciting.",
              "Especially having a new son myself, being able to go back in time and look at some of those moments is pretty powerful.",
              "We're excited to see where that takes us and just being able to offer more and more experiences like this.",
              "[00:21:07.",
              "313] Brit Mennuti: Yeah, I think another thing that I'm particularly excited about is seeing what new use cases for the tool of Tor Creator that people have that we haven't thought of yet.",
              "As a product manager who worked on blocks, when we originally conceived of blocks, we thought that people would use it to model just singular 3D objects.",
              "And what actually happened is that people were creating entire 3D VR scenes with this product.",
              "And that was not something we ever envisioned would happen, but we were so glad it did because it gave us a new understanding for where the product could go in the future.",
              "I think the same could be true of Tour Creator.",
              "So we'll see what people do with these different photos, how they annotate them, how they add different media to them, the applications they use them for, and there'll perhaps be new opportunities for us to expand the product.",
              "[00:21:48.",
              "090] Jennifer Holland: I'll just say we take feedback very seriously, which I know you know.",
              "And we ask everybody to just submit feedback using that send feedback button.",
              "We read every single piece of feedback and we respond.",
              "So if there are things that are missing or you want certain features, please let us know because that's how we decide what to build next.",
              "[00:22:06.",
              "765] Kent Bye: Great.",
              "And finally, what do you each think is the ultimate potential of virtual and augmented reality and what it might be able to enable?",
              "[00:22:16.",
              "533] Jennifer Holland: I'm just really excited about just making learning more accessible.",
              "You can imagine some of the most brilliant teachers and professors being able to offer experiences and students be able to leverage the technology to create experiences that would otherwise be impossible.",
              "[00:22:33.",
              "767] Brit Mennuti: My background is partially in business and partially in fine arts.",
              "And one of the things that I'm super stoked about in terms of AR and VR is it's a whole new medium for artists to actually express themselves and for people who maybe don't consider themselves artists to find a new way to express themselves.",
              "So even seeing teachers and students create expeditions, it's a marvelous thing to see them be creative.",
              "So I'm looking forward to seeing how this industry moves forward in terms of creative expression.",
              "[00:22:57.",
              "566] Kent Bye: All right.",
              "Awesome.",
              "Well, thank you so much for joining me today.",
              "[00:23:01.",
              "209] Jennifer Holland: Thanks for having us.",

              "240] Kent Bye: So, that was Jennifer Holland.",
              "She's a program manager for the Expeditions and Tour Creator on the ARVR team, as well as Brent Minuti, who's a product manager on the ARVR team working on Blocks, Poly, and Tour Creator.",
              "So, I have a number of different takeaways about this interview is that, first of all, generally, Google tends to be all about information and knowledge, and They're trying to capture all of the information in the world and be able to present it to you.",
              "And I think that when it comes to education, it's a natural fit for Google to start to take what's essentially a knowledge graph and figure out all these different tools to be able to translate that knowledge graph into these different educational experiences.",
              "So this is actually one of the areas that I think that I'm the most excited about for where this goes for Google, especially if there's some uptake when it comes to teachers.",
              "I think access to the technology is probably one of the biggest barriers to be able to actually deploy these out into the classrooms. And so it sounds like they have some partnerships with people like Best Buy that have these, what's essentially like an AV cart with a bunch of phones that are AR enabled as well as these VR headsets.",
              "So once the technology is in the hands of these teachers, then one of the things that, you know, when I was at the IEEE VR back in 2017, I had a chance to go to a K through 12 education workshop, which actually had some people from Google that were presenting some of their research findings.",
              "And what they found is that it's actually better to just create a generic experience of some sort of like concept without trying to specify it for any specific audience.",
              "And so You want to be able to take what's essentially like an experience, a visual metaphor of some concept, and then be able to use it for first graders and fifth graders and high school.",
              "And it's kind of, in some sense, independent for the grade level, because if it's specified at the grade level, then they will only use it for that grade level.",
              "The thing about VR and AR is that you can create these generalized experiences and that they can create this direct experience of some of these concepts so that you've in some ways be able to set the primary metaphors that are going to allow you to understand these mental models and these different maps of different dimensions of reality.",
              "So there's these different category schemas in our mind that are essentially like these buckets and categories to be able to file information to.",
              "And so a thing about VR is that it gives you the spatial metaphor that really creates these buckets in your brain in a way that can categorize information that is so much more effective than just talking about the abstract construct without having any sort of context for it.",
              "So I think VR is going to have this huge application, especially when it comes to these concepts of embodied cognition.",
              "You're going to be able to have a direct experience of something.",
              "You're going to sort of get the overview of these concepts.",
              "And then the teacher is going to be able to share these larger concepts about these ideas.",
              "Or also what has been happening with a lot of these things is that the students start to teach each other.",
              "And so the student becomes a teacher to other people.",
              "As they figure something out, then they get to share that to other people.",
              "The selfie sticks seems to be a way that you're able to both get this increased level of embodiment I know last year at Google IO some of the demos that they were showing they were using these selfie sticks and you're able to just get this deep sense of presence of that I don't know there was something about being able to have it far away from your face and be able to walk around that allowed you to have more of a clear window into these augmented reality worlds and so I it sounds like that a lot of these tools are going to be launching with AR features as well and so they're going to be leveraging a lot of these aspects of ARCore that are kind of built into some of these phones and that you know to a certain extent I think that AR may be a little bit better and easier for these educational applications just because once a student goes unveiled within a VR headset then it's difficult to have a social interaction with them at that point and that so much of the learning is socially constructed and seeing what other people are saying and that if it's in AR, then you have a little bit better of a social cohesion within a group of students.",
              "So I expect that a lot of these educational things will be in AR first for these groups and areas, but there will actually be some topics that you will need to want to have the full immersion of the virtual reality.",
              "And I think the virtual tours are also very exciting to see where this goes, and to have this pipeline within Poly.",
              "It was originally just to kind of share these blocks and Tilt Brush, but what Britt Manute said was that people started to essentially upload these entire scenes, and so they kind of took that as a sign that they can start to you know, take these entire virtual tours, put a 360 photo in there and start to annotate it and have like different audio and basically create an audio tour with this stack of web tools, essentially, so that you can upload it to Poly and then you get this URL.",
              "And once you have the URL, then that can be sent around.",
              "And that is something that you could use to target these different applications that can load dynamically.",
              "And you don't have to necessarily download a specific app.",
              "although I think you know one of the things that they try to create with the Google expeditions was to Create it so that if you do have like really poor Wi-Fi or for you completely off the grid Then you can still be able to pre download stuff beforehand and then be able to share it to the students So I'm not sure exactly how that's gonna work with the you know URLs and be able to dynamically load stuff But it sounds like they're creating a system so that it can work both online and offline I asked about what kind of business models they have in terms of whether you'll be able to sell these types of things.",
              "And talking to different VR artists, one of the feedback they have for Poly is that, well, it'd be really nice if you can actually sell some of my models that I'm creating here.",
              "They have Creative Commons integration, which is awesome and great.",
              "And that is really encouraging the ability to essentially create these open repositories of art that people are creating from a user-generated perspective, but have a mechanism by which they can share them out and have people just use them.",
              "you're able to contribute to this larger repository of educational experiences that can be created if you create something to put up on Polly, either through Tilt Brush or through Blocks.",
              "But at the same time, Google at the launch didn't launch with something where they had the store mindset in mind.",
              "It wasn't a top priority for them to make it available for the creators to be able to make a living off of this.",
              "It just wasn't a top priority in their minimum viable product.",
              "And it also just generally, as Google does, they sort of put things out there and let you kind of figure it out on your own.",
              "It's kind of like YouTube is a decentralized platform where, you know, if you get to the point where you get a huge audience and people actually clicking on ads, then you can really make a go of it as a living.",
              "But at that point, then you kind of become susceptible to the whims of the algorithm for the ads.",
              "And so It's kind of like this interesting dynamic where Google is enabling a lot of people to create all this stuff, but at the same time, the economic models to really make it fully sustainable, I think, is something that, without thinking about that, we'll see how far it can really go.",
              "It's basically relying upon people's free labor to be able to generate these different types of educational products, which is great if you want to help support these types of educational experiences.",
              "But if you want to make a huge living off of it, then I think it's something where you have to find other revenue streams or grants or ways to really sustain yourself in doing that.",
