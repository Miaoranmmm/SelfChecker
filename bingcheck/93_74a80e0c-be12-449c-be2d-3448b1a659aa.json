              "Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.",

              "[6] The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[7] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris.",
              "Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side.",
              "During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930.",
              "It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height.",

              "2 metres (17 ft).",
              "Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.",
              "The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels.",
              "The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground \u2013 the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union.",

              "He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as Thomas Edison.",
              "The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and E\u0301mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des E\u0301tablissements Eiffel.",
              "It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution.",
              "Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.",
              "[8] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".",
              "[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design.",
              "Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.",
              "The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name.",
              "On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socie\u0301te\u0301 des Inge\u0301nieurs Civils;",
              "after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise [n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.",
              "[10] Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Gre\u0301vy was re-elected as president of France and E\u0301douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade.",
              "A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.",
              "[10] (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.)",
              "On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.",
              "After some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887.",
              "Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.",
              "5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.",
              "5 million francs.",
              "Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years.",
              "He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.",
              "[11] A French bank, the Cre\u0301dit Industriel et Commercial (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower.",
              "During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower.",
              "These loans were connected to an indemnity controversy which saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, \"effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income\".",
              "According to The New York Times, \"[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.\"",
              "[12] The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds.",
              "Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[13] and many people believed it was impossible.",
              "These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering.",
              "It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet.",
              "A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887: We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream.",
              "And for twenty years .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.",
              "[14] Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man.",
              "Will it not also be grandiose in its way?",
              "And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"",
              "[15] These criticisms were also dealt with by E\u0301douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying,[16] \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.",
              "Indeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection.",
              "Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\"",
              "[17] Some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built;",
              "others remained unconvinced.",
              "[18] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.",
              "[19] By 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.",
              "[20] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.",
              "Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.",
              "[21] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.",
              "6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg.",
              "The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[22] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick.",
              "Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.",
              "Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.",
              "5 m (25 ft) long.",
              "The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began.",
              "The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.",
              "[23] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm (0.",
              "04 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc.",
              "[24] The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed.",
              "No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration.",
              "In all, 18,038 pieces were joined using 2.",
              "5 million rivets.",
              "[21] At first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold.",
              "This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\"",
              "and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press.",
              "[25] At this stage, a small \"creeper\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg.",

              "The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground \u2013 the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union.",
              "Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels.",
              "The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent a 600 step climb.",
              "Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.",
              "On this top, third level is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel's private use.",
              "He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as Thomas Edison.",
              "The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and E\u0301mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des E\u0301tablissements Eiffel.",
              "It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution.",
              "Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.",
              "[8] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".",
              "[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design.",
              "Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.",
              "The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name.",
              "On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socie\u0301te\u0301 des Inge\u0301nieurs Civils;",
              "after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise [n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.",
              "[10] Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Gre\u0301vy was re-elected as president of France and E\u0301douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade.",
              "A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.",
              "[10] (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.)",
              "On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.",
              "After some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887.",
              "Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.",
              "5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.",
              "5 million francs.",
              "Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years.",
              "He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.",
              "[11] A French bank, the Cre\u0301dit Industriel et Commercial (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower.",
              "During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower.",
              "These loans were connected to an indemnity controversy which saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, \"effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income\".",
              "According to The New York Times, \"[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.\"",
              "[12] The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds.",
              "Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[13] and many people believed it was impossible.",
              "These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering.",
              "It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet.",
              "A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887: We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection .",

              "To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream.",

              "we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.",
              "[14] Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man.",
              "Will it not also be grandiose in its way?",
              "And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"",
              "[15] These criticisms were also dealt with by E\u0301douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying,[16] \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.",
              "Indeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection.",
              "Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\"",
              "[17] Some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built;",
              "others remained unconvinced.",
              "[18] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.",
              "[19] By 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.",
              "[20] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.",
              "Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.",
              "[21] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.",
              "6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg.",
              "The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[22] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick.",
              "Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.",
              "Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.",
              "5 m (25 ft) long.",
              "The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began.",
              "The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.",
              "[23] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm (0.",
              "04 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc.",
              "[24] The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed.",
              "No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration.",
              "In all, 18,038 pieces were joined using 2.",
              "5 million rivets.",
              "[21] At first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold.",

              "hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold.",
              "Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[21] due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens, only one person died.",

              "[18] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features.",
              "Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, E\u0301mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustre\u0301, completed the ascent.",

              "The city had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for many innovations in the early 20th century, particularly radio telegraphy, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit, and from 1910 it also became part of the International Time Service.",
              "[33] For the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille.",
              "These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism as the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower.",
              "Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.",

              "It was won by the construction firm of Gustave Eiffel, which had recently built the iron frame of the Statue of Liberty.",
              "The Eiffel firm had advance knowledge of the project and, beginning in 1884, had already designed a tower exactly to those dimensions.",

              "An Eiffel architect, Stephen Sauvestre, designed the curving form and decoration which gave the tower its distinctive appearance.",
              "Eiffel was granted exclusive rights for twenty years to operate the tower and its restaurants and viewing platforms. A site next to the River was chosen, despite the infiltration of river water, since that land was owned by the City of Paris, and the tower could be kept in place after the exposition was completed.",
              "[9] The construction lasted two years, two months and five days, and involved five hundred workers, who assembled eighteen thousand iron pieces, each of five meters and carefully numbered, which had been made at a factory in Levallois-Perret, a Paris suburb.",
              "Speaking of the tower construction workers, the son-in-law of Eiffel, declared, \"no soldier on the battle field deserved better mention than these humble toilers, who, will never go down in history.\"",

              "[9] When the exposition ended, the tower was used for a time as a weather station.",
              "In 1904, Eiffel proposed to the French military that a radio transmitter, designed by the pioneer radio engineer Edouard Branly, be placed on the third level.",
              "In 1909, when Eiffel's concession formally ended, it was decided to preserve the Tower permanently.",

              "Designed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, the Tower was meant to commemorate the centennial of the French Revolution and to show off France's modern industrial prowess on a world stage.",
              "And that it did.",
              "The tower's construction, finished after two years, two months, and five days, was considered a marvel of precision and speed.",
              "Gustave Eiffel's civil engineering firm used 7,300 tons of iron and 2.",
              "5 million rivets, and the result stood triumphant over the Champs de Mars, receiving more than two million visitors during the fair.",
              "The Tower\u2019s now-famous silhouette has been emulated around the world in places like Las Vegas, Prague, Tianducheng, China, and, of course, Paris, Texas.",
              "The design wasn\u2019t without its detractors, however \u2014 a \"Protest against the Tower of Monsieur Eiffel,\u201d signed by the likes of Guy de Maupassant, Alexandre Dumas fils, and other well-known artists, was published in the newspaper Le Temps before the project\u2019s completion.",
              "The letter argued that the tower would be \u201ca gigantic black factory chimney, its barbarous mass overwhelming and humiliating all our monuments and belittling our works of architecture, which will just disappear before this stupefying folly.",
              "\u201d In defiance of such protests, the Eiffel Tower did see the light of day and has stood the test of time.",
              "It remains one of the most visited monuments in the world, welcoming almost seven million visitors a year and more than 300 million people since its debut.",
              "It has changed over the years, with the addition of lighting, fresh coats of paint, and numerous installations that have come and gone.",
              "And there\u2019s still more to this landmark than meets the eye.",
              "Despite the incredible number of people who have visited since it opened, La Dame de Fer still has a few secrets to share.",
              "Gustave Eiffel reserved the uppermost level of the tower for himself, where he hosted famous guests like Thomas Edison in a private apartment that he designed.",
              "The space has since been transformed into a recreation of Eiffel's office, complete with wax figures of himself, his daughter, and Edison, and it's open for the public to tour.",
              "While the tower is named for Eiffel, it was actually Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier \u2014 two engineers who worked for his company \u2014 who designed the structure.",
              "They also commissioned French architect Stephen Sauvestre to work on the appearance of the project in order to quell public concerns about the harsh, utilitarian nature of the original design.",
              "They ultimately beat out more than 100 other projects in a contest to choose the main attraction of the World's Fair.",
              "The tower was built with the intent of showing off France's industrial prowess during the World's Fair, but the plan was to tear it down after 20 years.",
              "However, Eiffel cleverly put a radio antenna and wireless telegraph transmitter in the tower.",
              "After proving radio\u2019s usefulness to the government in 1910, Eiffel was granted a 70-year extension to his lease.",
              "By 1980, of course, the tower had become an indelible symbol of both Paris and France, and it was in no danger of demolition.",
              "In August 1944, as the Nazis were losing control of occupied Paris, Adolf Hitler commanded his generals to level the city.",
              "Plans were drawn up to mine the Eiffel Tower with explosives.",

              "Subsequent air raids over Paris caused significant damage, but the Eiffel Tower survived the war intact.",
              "As sculptor Fre\u0301de\u0301ric-Auguste Bartholdi was designing \u201cLiberty Enlightening the World\u201d, he called upon his mentor, Euge\u0300ne Viollet-le-Duc, to design the statue\u2019s internal framework.",
              "After Viollet-le-Duc died in 1879, Bartholdi turned to Eiffel and Koechlin.",
              "They proved their iron expertise with Lady Liberty before moving on to the Iron Lady.",
              "The tower has been home to several businesses throughout the years, many of which are now gone.",
              "These include the newspaper \u201cLe Figaro\u201d, which had an office on the second floor for six months during the 1889 World's Fair, a post office tucked into the first floor, and a wooden theater on the first floor designed by Sauvestre.",
              "Gim42/Getty Images Eiffel, an avid scientist, housed a meteorology lab on the tower's third floor.",
              "He was known to perform studies in physics and aerodynamics there, even building a wind tunnel at the foot of the structure.",
              "Eiffel opened the doors of the laboratory for other scientists to use for their experiments as well.",
              "The massive iron structure is wind resistant and will sway during a storm.",
              "Wind isn't the only thing that can make the enormous tower move, though \u2014 the heat of the sun causes the iron to expand, making the Tower grow a few centimeters during the summer months.",
              "The tower will also lean an average of six inches away from the sun, as the one side facing the direct light heats up faster than the other three sides.",
              "The names of French scientists and engineers working in the 19th century were not forgotten by history \u2014 not only are they attached to several Parisian streets, but 72 of them are also engraved on the Eiffel Tower.",
              "The tributes were painted over in the early 20th century, but thanks to a restoration effort in the late 1980s, they are once again visible.",
              "Eagle-eyed visitors can see names like Foucault, Dumas, and Perrier cut into the iron surrounding the tower's first floor.",
              "Every seven years, workers apply around 60 tons of paint to the tower.",
              "This not only keeps La Dame de Fer looking good, but it also helps keep the iron from rusting.",
              "The Tower\u2019s first light show coincided with the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in 1925.",
              "Automaker Andre Citro\u0308en financed a 200,000-bulb show that featured a shower of stars, alternating Zodiac symbols, comets, and (naturally) his car brand\u2019s name at the finale.",
              "Another show, featuring 336 yellow-orange spotlights, came sixty years later, but the now-famous sparkling light show, consisting of 20,000 bulbs, first lit up the night sky New Year\u2019s Eve 1999 to ring in the new millennium.",
              "While the Tower itself is in the public domain, its illumination is protected by copyright under French law.",
              "However, don\u2019t call your lawyer just yet \u2014 this only applies to pictures taken for professional use.",
              "You\u2019re free to share any personal pictures of the Eiffel Tower and its lights as you please.",
              "If you're brave enough to climb the stairs to the top of the tower, reward yourself with a glass of Champagne from the Champagne Bar.",

              "[8] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".",
              "[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design.",
              "Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.",
              "The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name.",
              "On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socie\u0301te\u0301 des Inge\u0301nieurs Civils;",
              "after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise [n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.",

              "These loans were connected to an indemnity controversy which saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, \"effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income\".",
              "According to The New York Times, \"[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.\"",

              "Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[13] and many people believed it was impossible.",
              "These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering.",
              "It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet.",
              "A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887: We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection .",

              ".",
              "To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream.",
              "And for twenty years .",

              "we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.",
              "[14] Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man.",
              "Will it not also be grandiose in its way?",
              "And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"",
              "[15] These criticisms were also dealt with by E\u0301douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying,[16] \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.",
              "Indeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection.",
              "Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\"",
              "[17] Some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built;",
              "others remained unconvinced.",
              "[18] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.",
              "[19] By 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.",
              "[20] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.",
              "Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.",
              "[21] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.",
              "6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg.",
              "The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[22] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick.",
              "Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.",
              "Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.",
              "5 m (25 ft) long.",
              "The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began.",
              "The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.",
              "[23] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm (0.",
              "04 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc.",
              "[24] The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed.",
              "No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration.",
              "In all, 18,038 pieces were joined using 2.",
              "5 million rivets.",
              "[21] At first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold.",
              "This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\"",
              "and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press.",
              "[25] At this stage, a small \"creeper\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg.",

              "The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.",

              "hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold.",
              "Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[21] due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens, only one person died.",

              "[18] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features.",
              "Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, E\u0301mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustre\u0301, completed the ascent.",

              "It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris.",
              "The city had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for many innovations in the early 20th century, particularly radio telegraphy, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit, and from 1910 it also became part of the International Time Service.",
              "[33] For the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille.",
              "These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism as the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower.",
              "Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.",

              "Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level.",

              "[77] Constructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward: the legs were wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track, and a contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs.",
              "[78] Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached.",
              "Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car's weight.",
              "The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit.",

              "The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level.",
              "After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg.",
              "This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level.",

              "[83][84] The only non-structural elements are the four decorative grill-work arches, added in Sauvestre's sketches, which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition.",

              "2 metres (17 ft).",
              "Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.",
              "The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels.",
              "The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground \u2013 the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union.",
              "Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels.",
              "The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent a 600 step climb.",
              "Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.",
              "On this top, third level is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel's private use.",
              "He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as Thomas Edison.",
              "The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and E\u0301mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des E\u0301tablissements Eiffel.",
              "It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution.",
              "Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.",
              "[8] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".",
              "[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design.",
              "Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.",
              "The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name.",
              "On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socie\u0301te\u0301 des Inge\u0301nieurs Civils;",
              "after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise [n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.",
              "[10] Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Gre\u0301vy was re-elected as president of France and E\u0301douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade.",
              "A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.",
              "[10] (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.)",
              "On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.",
              "After some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887.",
              "Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.",
              "5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.",
              "5 million francs.",
              "Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years.",
              "He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.",
              "[11] A French bank, the Cre\u0301dit Industriel et Commercial (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower.",
              "During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower.",
              "These loans were connected to an indemnity controversy which saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, \"effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income\".",
              "According to The New York Times, \"[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.\"",
              "[12] The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds.",
              "Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[13] and many people believed it was impossible.",
              "These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering.",
              "It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet.",
              "A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887: We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection .",

              ".",
              "To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream.",
              "And for twenty years .",

              "we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.",
              "[14] Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man.",
              "Will it not also be grandiose in its way?",
              "And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"",
              "[15] These criticisms were also dealt with by E\u0301douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying,[16] \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.",
              "Indeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection.",
              "Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\"",
              "[17] Some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built;",
              "others remained unconvinced.",
              "[18] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.",
              "[19] By 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.",
              "[20] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.",
              "Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.",
              "[21] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.",
              "6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg.",
              "The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[22] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick.",
              "Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.",
              "Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.",
              "5 m (25 ft) long.",
              "The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began.",
              "The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.",
              "[23] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm (0.",
              "04 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc.",
              "[24] The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed.",
              "No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration.",
              "In all, 18,038 pieces were joined using 2.",
              "5 million rivets.",
              "[21] At first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold.",
              "This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\"",
              "and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press.",
              "[25] At this stage, a small \"creeper\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg.",

              "hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold.",
              "Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[21] due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens, only one person died.",

              "[18] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features.",
              "Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, E\u0301mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustre\u0301, completed the ascent.",

              "The city had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for many innovations in the early 20th century, particularly radio telegraphy, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit, and from 1910 it also became part of the International Time Service.",
              "[33] For the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille.",
              "These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism as the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower.",
              "Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.",

              "It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889.",
              "Locally nicknamed \"La dame de fer\" (French for \"Iron Lady\"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair.",
              "Although initially criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.",
              "[3] The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022.",
              "[4] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:[5] 6.",
              "91 million people ascended it in 2015.",
              "It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site (\"Paris, Banks of the Seine\") in 1991.",
              "[6] The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[7] about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris.",
              "Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side.",
              "During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930.",
              "It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and 300-metre mark in height.",
              "Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.",
              "2 metres (17 ft).",
              "Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.",
              "The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels.",
              "The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft) above the ground \u2013 the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union.",
              "Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels.",
              "The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent a 600 step climb.",
              "Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.",
              "On this top, third level is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel's private use.",
              "He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as Thomas Edison.",
              "The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and E\u0301mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des E\u0301tablissements Eiffel.",
              "It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution.",
              "Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.",
              "[8] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".",
              "[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design.",
              "Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.",
              "The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name.",
              "On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socie\u0301te\u0301 des Inge\u0301nieurs Civils;",
              "after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise [n]ot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.",
              "[10] Little progress was made until 1886, when Jules Gre\u0301vy was re-elected as president of France and E\u0301douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade.",
              "A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.",
              "[10] (A 300-metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort.)",
              "On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.",
              "After some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887.",
              "Eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, the contract granting him 1.",
              "5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.",
              "5 million francs.",
              "Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years.",
              "He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.",
              "[11] A French bank, the Cre\u0301dit Industriel et Commercial (CIC), helped finance the construction of the Eiffel Tower.",
              "During the period of the tower's construction, the CIC was acquiring funds from predatory loans to the National Bank of Haiti, some of which went towards the financing of the tower.",
              "These loans were connected to an indemnity controversy which saw France force Haiti's government to financially compensate French slaveowners for lost income as a result of the Haitian Revolution, and required Haiti to pay the CIC and its partner nearly half of all taxes collected on exports, \"effectively choking off the nation's primary source of income\".",
              "According to The New York Times, \"[at] a time when the [CIC] was helping finance one of the world's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower, as a monument to French liberty, it was choking Haiti's economy, taking much of the young nation's income back to Paris and impairing its ability to start schools, hospitals and the other building blocks of an independent country.\"",
              "[12] The proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds.",
              "Prior to the Eiffel Tower's construction, no structure had ever been constructed to a height of 300 m, or even 200 m for that matter,[13] and many people believed it was impossible.",
              "These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering.",
              "It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet.",
              "A petition called \"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Adolphe Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887: We, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection .",

              ".",
              ".",
              "To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream.",
              "And for twenty years .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.",
              "[14] Gustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man.",
              "Will it not also be grandiose in its way?",
              "And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\"",
              "[15] These criticisms were also dealt with by E\u0301douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, sardonically saying,[16] \"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.",
              "Indeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection.",
              "Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\"",
              "[17] Some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built;",
              "others remained unconvinced.",
              "[18] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.",
              "[19] By 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.",
              "[20] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.",
              "Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.",
              "[21] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2 m (6.",
              "6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg.",
              "The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[22] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick.",
              "Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.",
              "Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.",
              "5 m (25 ft) long.",
              "The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began.",
              "The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.",
              "[23] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 1 mm (0.",
              "04 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc.",
              "[24] The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed.",
              "No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration.",
              "In all, 18,038 pieces were joined using 2.",
              "5 million rivets.",
              "[21] At first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold.",
              "This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \"Eiffel Suicide!\"",
              "and \"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\" appeared in the tabloid press.",
              "[25] At this stage, a small \"creeper\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg.",
              "They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs.",
              "The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.",
              "[21] Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments to precisely align the legs;",
              "hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold.",
              "Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[21] due to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens, only one person died.",
              "[26] 18 July 1887:The start of the erection of the metalwork 7 December 1887:Construction of the legs with scaffolding 20 March 1888:Completion of the first level 15 May 1888:Start of construction on the second stage 21 August 1888:Completion of the second level 26 December 1888:Construction of the upper stage 15 March 1889:Construction of the cupola The main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower.",
              "[18] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features.",
              "Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, E\u0301mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustre\u0301, completed the ascent.",
              "At 2:35 pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.",
              "[27] There was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May;",
              "even then, the lifts had not been completed.",
              "The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.",
              "[28] Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[29] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.",
              "[3] After dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light.",
              "Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition.",
              "The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.",
              "[citation needed] On the second level, the French newspaper Le Figaro had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, Le Figaro de la Tour, was made.",
              "There was also a pa\u0302tisserie.",
              "[citation needed] At the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit.",
              "Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower.",
              "Gustave Eiffel described the collection of responses as \"truly curious\".",
              "[30] Famous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison.",
              "[28] Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.",
              "[31] Edison signed the guestbook with this message: To M Eiffel the Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison.",
              "Eiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations, and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies.",
              "[32] Eiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years.",
              "It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris.",
              "The city had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for many innovations in the early 20th century, particularly radio telegraphy, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit, and from 1910 it also became part of the International Time Service.",
              "[33] For the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille.",
              "These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism as the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower.",
              "Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.",
              "[34] At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level.",
              "The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level.",
              "The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.",
              "[citation needed] On 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No.",

              "Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour.",
              "[35] In 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower.",
              "He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays.",
              "[36] Two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 m) to demonstrate his parachute design.",
              "[37] In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.",
              "[38] From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citroe\u0308n adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time.",
              "[39] In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power.",
              "On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed.",

              "If you will be taking the stairs, these are located on the south pillar.",
              "We\u2019ve done both, the stairs and the lift.",
              "If you have the energy, the stairs tend to be a little bit faster, since there usually is no line.",
              "If you have a lift ticket, the lift skips the first level and goes directly to the second level.",
              "If you have a ticket to visit the third level, I recommend getting in line for this as soon as you reach the second level.",
              "Lines can be long and with the possibility of closure, it\u2019s best to visit the 3rd level first (our tour guide also recommended this same plan of attack).",

              "The best time to visit the Eiffel Tower is about one hour before sunset, so you can gaze out over Paris both as it is illuminated by the sun, but also get to see the lights twinkle on as the sun lowers across the sky.",
              "If you stay past sunset, you\u2019ll be on the Eiffel Tower when its lights sparkle.",
              "We also like being on the Eiffel Tower midday, which is a great time to photograph the city from the tower.",
              "If you are unable to get tickets online in advance, here are a few tours of the Eiffel Tower that get great reviews.",
              "One of the cheapest options is to purchase an entrance ticket via a third-party provider.",
              "This tour, which includes your entrance ticket and the option to add on the third level, is one of the tours that we took.",
              "We met our guide at Champs de Mars Cafe\u0301, walked to the Eiffel Tower in a small group, the guide accompanied us to the second level, and then we were on our own.",
              "This costs just a few euros more than the ticket on the official website, so it\u2019s a great option if you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money but also want to avoid the wait in the ticket line.",
              "We also took this tour, which is very similar to the one above.",
              "It\u2019s a little more expensive but the guide did not waste any time getting us into the Esplanade and up to the second level.",
              "For that reason, I liked this one a little bit more.",
              "This is one of the highest reviewed tours of the Eiffel Tower.",
              "Visit the second level and/or summit with a guide on this 2-to-3-hour tour.",

              "How long does a visit to the Eiffel Tower last?",
              "Most visits to the Eiffel Tower take 2 to 3 hours, which includes the time it takes to get through security.",
              "However, if you did not purchase a ticket online in advance, it\u2019s possible that you could spend an additional 2 to 3 hours in line for tickets, especially during the summer, weekends, and holidays.",
              "Is there luggage storage at the Eiffel Tower?",
              "There is no luggage storage at the Eiffel Tower.",
              "If you have a suitcase, you will not be permitted to enter the security check to enter the Esplanade.",

              "Gustave Eiffel's company, that was located in Levallois Perret, very near Paris, France, also built the metal framework for another world-famous monument: the Statue of Liberty (New York, United States), designed by Auguste Bartholdi and offered to the United States as a gift from France to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the American Declaration of Independence in 1886.",
              "The Eiffel Tower is made of iron, not steel.",
              "The puddle iron that makes up the Eiffel Tower's structure came from the Pompey forges (East of France).",
              "The iron plates and beams produced through the puddling process were then preassembled in the Eiffel factories in Levallois Perret using rivets.",
              "Finally, these pieces were taken to the Eiffel Tower construction site to be mounted.",
              "The prefab system is what allowed them to build the Eiffel Tower in a record time of 2 years, 2 months and 5 days.",
              "Structure of the Eiffel Tower, \u00a9 SETE_AlexandreNestora The iron used to build the Eiffel Tower went through a refining process called puddling which eliminated the excess carbon when the ore was melted.",
              "Following this process, you obtain almost pure iron, which was, according to Gustave Eiffel at that time, the best and most robust of materials.",
              "To protect it from corrosion, the iron is covered with a thick coat of paint that has to be renewed every 7 years.",
              "This repainting schedule was recommended by Gustave Eiffel himself and is still respected to date.",
              "The Eiffel Tower was built to be one the main attractions at the Paris World's Fair in 1889.",

              "The Tower opened to the public the same day as the World's Fair, on May 15, 1889.",

              "Since 1889, the Eiffel Tower has always been opened for visits (except during the Word War 2 and the Covid-19 Pandemic): nearly 330 million visitors experienced the magic of the ascent -by elevator, or by the stairs - and discovered t8he magnificent view over Paris.",
              "Thanks to its universal power of attraction, it's the most visited monument in the world, with nearlty 7M visitors each year.",
              "Its height and unique silhouette floating above the Paris landscape quickly made the Eiffel Tower one of the most popular attractions in Paris.",

              "The Tower can be seen from many and various points around Paris and its suburbs.",
              "It is photographed, drawn, filmed, and replicated in all kinds of circumstances.",

              "A monument known around the world and a unique tourist attraction, the Eiffel Tower has loyally accompanied the people of Paris and its suburbs in their daily life.",
              "Rising to a height of 330 meters, it can be seen from all over Paris, and beyond, day and night until 1 am thanks to its lighting, the twinkling illumination at fixed times and its beacon that reaches out to 80 km, at 360 degrees.",
              "The Eiffel Tower has witnessed and sometimes been an actor in important events, both sumptuous and tragic, in France's history.",
              "In its early years the Eiffel Tower was a productive laboratory for scientific experiments, in particular for wireless telegraphy, which saved it from destruction after the initially scheduled period of 20 years.",
              "The Tower's destiny is also intimately linked to technical advancements in radio and television.",
              "The TDF installations and emitters at its summit broadcast all the digital terrestrial television and radio channels to the 12 million inhabitants of i\u0302le de France.",
              "Today, the Eiffel Tower's lights are turned off at night to honor the victims of dramatic events around the world.",
              "Even more than a symbol, it has become a means of expression for the city of Paris and all of France.",
              "We have to first put the Eiffel Tower back in its historical context.",
              "It was two engineers who worked in Gustave Eiffel's company who, in 1884, imagined building a metal tower 300 meters high for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris.",
              "These engineers were specialists in large-scale metallic structures like bridges, railway stations, viaducts, etc.",
              "It was only natural that the first sketch of the 300-meter Tower, issued from the calculations made by these two engineers, shows a pylon with 4 legs, each made of 4 robust beams linked together by open-web- joists that rise diagonally to meet at the summit.",
