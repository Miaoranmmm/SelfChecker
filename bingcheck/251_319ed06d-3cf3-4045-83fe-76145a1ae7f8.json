    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. There is no simple answer, but I can share some information and perspectives from different sources.\n\nAccording to [^1^], tourism is often perceived as a threat to conservation of World Heritage, but it can also be a platform and a vehicle for presenting heritage to the public, conserving it and guaranteeing its economic and social viability. Hence, tourism can be a balancing mechanism that keeps and protects the heritage itself.\n\nHowever, tourism can also have negative impacts on heritage sites, such as overcrowding, pollution, vandalism, commodification and loss of authenticity. These impacts can be mitigated by careful planning, management and regulation of tourism activities, as well as by engaging local communities and stakeholders in the decision-making and benefit-sharing processes.\n\nSome examples of innovative approaches that are being taken by countries and organizations to address this challenge are:\n\n- The UNESCO World Heritage Sustainable Tourism Toolkit[^1^], which provides guidance and resources for site managers, tourism operators, local communities and visitors on how to manage tourism at World Heritage sites in a sustainable way.\n- The OurWorldHeritage initiative[^1^], which aims to foster dialogue and collaboration among different actors and sectors involved in heritage conservation and tourism, and to raise awareness and mobilize action for the protection of World Heritage sites under threat.\n- The Solimar International approach[^4^], which focuses on how tourism can protect cultural heritage through community empowerment, education, storytelling, product development and marketing.\n- The New York Times article[^3^], which explores the benefits and challenges of being a UNESCO World Heritage site for different cities along the Swahili Coast, and how they cope with the opportunities and pressures of tourism.\n\nI hope this information is helpful for you. \ud83d\ude0a",

              "The analysis highlights that for many countries, regions and destinations, tourism growth remains economically, socially and environmentally unbalanced, often as a result of rapid and unplanned growth in visitor numbers.",
              "However, there is no one-size fits all solution, as the opportunities and challenges for tourism development will vary depending on the unique characteristics of individual destinations.",

              "Economic, social and environmental impacts are felt at every destination visited by tourists, regardless of the volume or the locality.",
              "While the effect (positive or negative) and magnitude of specific impacts might be possible to estimate at a point in time, they will also vary according to the unique characteristics of individual destinations.",
              "For example, the ability of sensitive natural and cultural sites to cope with visitor numbers, and the ability, or willingness, of those affected to adapt.",
              "There is a growing argument that tourism success should not be measured solely in visitor numbers, but rather its ability to contribute to local economies and the net benefits it provides to destinations.",

              "It draws upon responses to an OECD survey of Member and Partner countries, recent work by the OECD Tourism Committee, and feedback from participants of an OECD Workshop on Tourism as a Catalyst for Regional Development (co-hosted by Austria), bringing together national and regional policy-makers, international institutions, and representatives from industry and academia.",
              "The chapter begins by outlining the key global trends driving continued global tourism growth over the coming decades, and seeks to better understand the implications for cities, regions and communities.",
              "The need to revisit the policy framework supporting tourism is then explored, in order to better address environmental and social sustainability at the destination level, and how tourism can better contribute to the sustainable growth agenda.",
              "A range of policy considerations are provided to not only respond to the increased pressure on destinations due to tourism growth, but also enable existing and emerging destinations to avoid potential pitfalls as they strive to strike a balance between the benefits and costs associated with tourism development and implement a sustainable vision for the future.",

              "5% of service exports.",
              "The significant growth in global tourism has benefitted greatly from the rise of globalisation and technological advances that have led to cheaper airfares, making it easier for people to plan and book their own travel, and then to share their experiences with friends in real time.",
              "While growth is projected to continue, changing demographics, improved connectivity for destinations, technological innovations, and increased recognition of the need for more sustainable and inclusive growth, are likely to dramatically transform the face of tourism by 2040, representing a range of opportunities and challenges for destinations (OECD, 2018).",
              "Diverse employment opportunities \u2013 Tourism directly accounts for, on average, 6.",
              "9% of total employment in OECD countries.",
              "As a labour-intensive industry, tourism provides flexible working hours, with workers participating in many different sub-sectors and in a variety of locations.",
              "It requires a wide variety of types and levels of skill, ranging from low to high, and from technical to non-technical personal or social skills, and increasingly digital and green skills.",
              "Benefits for urban, regional and rural economies \u2013 In urban areas, tourism can promote the development of activities and attractions, infrastructure and equipment to accommodate and attract domestic and international visitors.",
              "In rural regions, tourism constitutes an important lever for economic development and growth, often articulated around local gastronomy, farming, culture (arts and crafts), and outdoor activities, and provides significant opportunities for rural businesses to diversify income opportunities (e.",
              "g. farm stays) and participate in local supply chains.",
              "Opportunities for innovative small-scale business operations \u2013 Tourism creates demand for specific goods and specialised services, including transport, accommodation, travel, and supporting services to meet the needs of niche and emerging travel markets (e.",
              "g. adventure, health and wellness, creative and sports tourism).",
              "When small and medium enterprise (SMEs) respond to opportunities to meet the specific needs of travellers, the cumulative effect on local communities and economies can be significant, particularly as SMEs represent around 85% of those enterprises with a major role in the delivery of tourism services in OECD countries (e.",
              "g. accommodation and food services, travel agencies, tour operators), compared to roughly two-thirds for the wider economy.",
              "Support for the promotion of cultural authenticity and natural assets \u2013 Cultural authenticity and natural assets are important tools for countries and destinations to leverage in their efforts to attract tourists.",
              "When built upon broad stakeholder engagement and sustainable development principles, tourism can raise awareness of cultural and environmental values, and help finance the protection and management of protected areas and sensitive sites.",
              "Tourism can also play an important role in demonstrating the economic value of environmental and cultural heritage conservation and authenticity of a destination, primarily through the level of activity that it can stimulate in the local, regional, and national economy.",
              "In many countries, including Australia, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Sweden, and the US, tourism also plays an important role in promoting and maintaining indigenous traditions, art, and culture, which are typically major attractions for visitors.",
              "In turn, tourism represents a major source of revenue for many indigenous communities.",
              "Support for infrastructure-related development and maintenance \u2013 Improved transport infrastructure not only plays a significant role in attracting tourists, but also in improving the quality of life of the local population.",
              "Furthermore, it promotes the distribution of socio-economic benefits related to the tourists\u2019 expenses (e.",
              "g. incomes, jobs) and interactions with local residents (e.",
              "g. cultural heritage diffusion and maintenance, new languages skills).",
              "Tourism can also generate additional funding for the development and maintenance of transport systems (Albalate and Bel, 2010), public spaces, cultural attractions, and convention centres, which all contribute to the attractiveness of destinations.",
              "While the specific impacts of these trends remain uncertain and will vary between countries and destinations, it is clear that in order to prepare and respond effectively, governments at all levels will need to have a clear strategic vision, with well-articulated objectives, and adopt an integrated approach bringing together key stakeholders.",
              "Developing a comprehensive long-term vision with short- to medium-term action plans providing the flexibility to quickly identify and respond to emerging trends and evolving priorities, will provide a stable platform for sustainable and inclusive growth (OECD, 2018).",
              "As one of the largest, fastest, and most consistent growth sectors in the world economy, tourism\u2019s key role in global economic activity, including significant contributions to job creation, export revenue, and domestic value added, are well recognised.",
              "In this context, tourism can play an important role in improving the attractiveness and well-being of places, not only as destinations to visit, but also to live, work and invest.",
              "This in turn helps attract the educated young professionals upon which high value-added sectors increasingly depend (Glaeser, 2010).",
              "As such, tourism has the ability to make a considerable contribution to socioeconomic development in urban and rural areas, and support inclusive economic growth by providing i) diverse employment opportunities, ii) benefits for urban and regional economies, iii) opportunities for innovative small-scale business operations, iv) support for the promotion of cultural authenticity and natural assets, and v) support for infrastructure-related development and maintenance (Box 3.",
              "1).",
              "Sustainable tourism should not be considered a special form of tourism, but rather, all forms of tourism should strive to be more sustainable.",
              "Long-term sustainability requires a suitable balance to be struck between the environmental, economic and socio-cultural aspects of tourism development.",
              "It requires the informed participation of all relevant stakeholders, as well as strong political leadership to ensure wide participation and consensus building.",
              "Achieving sustainable tourism is an ongoing process that requires ongoing monitoring of impacts (economic, social and environmental) to capitalise on opportunities and respond to challenges as they arise, and inform future policy responses (OECD, 2018b;",
              "UNEP and UNWTO, 2005 and 2012).",
              "Despite tourism\u2019s clear potential as a driver for positive change, it is widely accepted that rapid or unplanned tourism growth can result in a range of negative impacts.",
              "For example, overcrowding and congestion of tourism-related infrastructure, often referred to as overtourism or unbalanced tourism, can lead to the degradation of natural and historical sites, monuments, landscapes and public spaces.",
              "This in turn can lead to a loss of identity and authenticity for destinations, negatively affecting not only the tourist experience, but also the environment and host communities upon which tourism so clearly depends (OECD, 2018b;",
              "Peeters et al.",

              "WTTC-McKinsey, 2017).",
              "The magnitude and combination of environmental, socio-cultural, and economic impacts associated with increasing visitor numbers, will vary depending on the unique characteristics of individual destinations, and a variety of other factors (Box ).",
              "These include the spatial and temporal distribution of visitors, the type and length of visitor stays, the ability of sensitive sites to cope with visitor volumes, and the ability, or willingness, of affected communities to adapt over time.",
              "Each will play a role in determining tourism\u2019s impact on a site or destination, with the most vulnerable often being coastal and mountain areas, islands, and cultural heritage sites.",
              "In today\u2019s digital age, the pervasive use of social media and peer-to-peer platforms have the ability to accelerate both the growth and the temporal and geographical concentration of tourism flows in many of these locations (Peeters et al.",
              ", 2018).",
              "As a result, tourist behaviour not in keeping with the cultural and social norms is becoming an issue in many city destinations, with \u2018meme\u2019 tourism a growing phenomenon driven by social media and the desire of many tourists to \u2018build their brand, rather than broaden their horizons\u2019, often resulting in claims by residents that it is \u2018disrespectful to treat communities as photo opportunities\u2019 and that tourists are more interested in taking pictures than contributing to the local economy (Mahdawi, 2019).",
              "The exponential growth in the tourism sharing economy is another case in point.",
              "Peer to peer platforms have the potential to drive economic growth and job creation, and generate added value by encouraging tourists to disperse to less well-known destinations, with the potential to support regional development.",
              "However, the benefits often come with various negative externalities.",
              "Accommodation sharing services in particular can affect neighbours and local residents, due to noise and other disturbances, and by adding pressure on local housing markets and traditional accommodation providers.",
              "In worst-case scenarios, poorly managed growth of these services may also have a detrimental impact on the historical fabric of destinations, lead to gentrification, reducing their appeal and affordability as places to live, and ultimately damaging their sustainability as a tourism destination of choice (OECD, 2016b).",
              "Environmental impacts from increased use are typically the result of steady growth in visitor numbers over time, significant peaks relating to seasonality, or more sudden, short-term shocks, such as the visit of a large cruise ship or the hosting of major events.",
              "High levels of congestion can lead to the deterioration of tourism-related infrastructure, facilities, and local flora and fauna, and exceed the capacity of support services to cope with demand, such as transport infrastructure, water and waste management (e.",
              "g. plastic, food, solid waste, water).",
              "Visitor overcrowding can create wear and tear on resources such as sensitive natural and historical sites.",
              "Other potential impacts include increased air, light and noise pollution and green-house gas emissions associated with the transport of tourists and supplies to/from/around destinations.",
              "Socio-cultural impacts associated with increased demand and visitation include impeding the day to day activities of local residents as a result of overcrowding and congestion at attractions, in public spaces, and on public transport.",
              "Growth in visitor numbers beyond the natural carrying capacity of destinations can also add pressure on existing infrastructure and services, thus negatively impacting the experience for locals and visitors alike.",
              "In urban areas, the spread of tourists beyond traditional tourism \u2018zones\u2019 into formerly residential neighbourhoods can lead to the alienation of local communities, due to inappropriate behaviour of tourists, increased noise pollution and pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and the degradation of community-specific infrastructure and facilities.",
              "Other impacts associated with increased visitor flows can include a loss of authenticity and cultural identity/heritage, for example an increase in hospitality, cultural and retail services for visitors, competing with and displacing resident-oriented services and facilities.",
              "In addition, the process of adapting and making adjustments to meet the needs, attitudes and values of tourists can lead to the modification of events, activities or cultural sites, or the loss or weakening of cultural traditions and values.",
              "Economic impacts can occur from an over-dependence on tourism income, with destinations experiencing high levels of seasonality particularly vulnerable and exposed to economic stress in off-peak periods, while unexpected events or shocks (e.",
              "g. weather, outbreaks of disease, or terrorist events) also have the ability to disproportionately affect destinations highly dependent on tourism.",
              "High levels of seasonality can also lead to employment pressures in other sectors in peak periods.",
              "In addition, while able to provide extra capacity in peak periods and potentially spread the impacts beyond traditional tourism hotspots, the exponential growth in accommodation platforms such as Airbnb in many cities has contributed to a disruption of the local real-estate market.",
              "Impacts include inflated real-estate prices, unfair competition for licenced accommodation providers, and gentrification of tourism hotspots and inner-city areas, sometimes to the point of pushing locals out of the area.",
              "The invisible burden, is a recently coined term to describe the unaccounted costs associated with providing local infrastructure and protecting environmental and socio-cultural systems for the benefit of both tourists and locals.",
              "Costs for each destination relate to the infrastructure required to transport, feed and accommodate, provide energy and water, and manage the waste of tourists and those employed in the sector (Epler Wood et al.",

              "As such, legislation was introduced in 2017 requiring the home-sharing activities of individuals to be registered and monitored, with the number of days that a property can be rented during the course of a year limited to 90.",
              "Increased surveillance following introduction of the legislation indicates that registrations are on the rise, while the total supply and number of bed nights in such accommodation are on a downward trend.",
              "Similar limits for \u2018entire home\u2019 listing and other restrictions have been introduced in many cities including Paris (120 days), London (90 days), San Francisco (90 days), and Amsterdam (30 days).",
              "In Barcelona, the City Council requires any accommodation to be offered as a tourist household to be registered, and enforces strict inspection and control measures to ensure they comply with local regulations \u2013 in 2017 the city requested that Airbnb remove 2 577 listings deemed to be operating without a city-approved license, or face a court case potentially leading to a substantial fine (O'Sullivan, 2018).",
              "As outlined above, specific tourism impacts are dependent on the unique characteristics of individual destinations.",
              "A recent study examining 41 international cases of overtourism, included an analysis of 18 different potential impacts to determine how often specific types of impact were present (Peeters et al.",

              "Congestion associated with infrastructure, and overcrowding at attractions, including natural, historical, and architectural sites (both falling in the category of environmental impacts), were the only impacts occurring across the four different destination types, demonstrating that this is a common issue for destinations under pressure, and should also be a consideration for developing destinations.",
              "An example of an initiative that has been employed with some success to address congestion at the the Cliffs of Moher, in Ireland, is outline below (Box ).",
              "While there is no \u2018one-size fits all\u2019 response, failure to adequately address the impacts associated with rising tourism numbers can lead to concerns over the value or worth of tourism for destinations, and even resentment towards visitors.",

              "Preliminary results indicate that several components have already reached or are approaching their tolerance limits.",
              "The Tourism Impact Assessment will, together with a new Tourism Policy Framework for 2020-30, guide work on a new action-oriented tourism strategy that will take effect in 2020.",
              "It will also serve as a tool for future decision-making regarding infrastructure investment and policy revision.",
              "The results will be regularly reassessed and updated as data sets improve.",
              "The data-centred approach of the Impact Assessment is considered an important first step in developing a holistic management system for tourism.",
              "It has the potential to become a foundation for optimising tourism\u2019s contribution to Iceland\u2019s economy and society whilst taking the carrying capacities of the resources that tourism builds on into account, contributing towards the sustainable development of the tourism industry in the future.",
              "The European Tourism Indicators System (ETIS) for sustainable destination management, was developed by the European Commission, with the aim of encouraging destinations to adopt a more intelligent approach to tourism planning.",
              "It is designed to be a management tool, supporting destinations who want to take a sustainable approach to destination management;",
              "a monitoring system, to facilitate the collection of data and detailed information and enable destinations to monitor performance;",
              "and an information tool, useful for policy makers, tourism enterprises and other stakeholders.",
              "Based on ETIS and UNWTO guidelines, Croatia has developed the Croatian Sustainable Tourism Observatory (CROSTO) as part of the International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO), to support the vision set by Croatia for the future of its tourism sector.",
              "Through regular and timely monitoring of sustainable tourism in the Adriatic Croatia, the observatory helps to raise awareness of the possible positive and negative impacts of tourism development in the region.",
              "One of the major aims for CROSTO is that it will help create better policies and propose adequate, necessary measures that will also inform the development of Croatia\u2019s new tourism strategy for 2021.",
              "In the case of Portugal\u2019s Tourism Strategy 2027, the implementation of the action plan required the development of a monitoring system to respond to the strategic goals, enable tourism policy evaluation and provide the private sector with necessary instruments for decision-making.",
              "In this context, a set of indicators covering the three pillars of sustainability were developed to encourage the adoption of sustainability principles throughout the industry \u2013 informed by UNWTO guidelines and ETIS.",
              "The development of indicators common to all regions, allows comparability and the ability to measure progress over time.",
              "At a more local level, a Smart Monitoring Pilot Scheme is being progressed for three tourist attractions in County Donegal, Ireland (Malin Head, Sliabh Liag and Fanad Head).",
              "The purpose of which is to work and collaborate with a range of stakeholders committed to the sustainable development of the Wild Atlantic Way coastal route, and anticipate and avoid potential negative environmental impacts.",
              "The smart monitoring project will comprise of counters/sensors installed at key points at each of these sensitive sites.",
              "A dashboard will enable the monitoring of visitor numbers in real time, the mode of arrival, and visitor movement within and around the site.",
              "Additional monitoring of water and air quality will also take place, with all collected data used to inform visitor management at various levels.",
              "Finally, in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector, it is critical that tourism grow in harmony with the local population.",
              "For example the Social Progress Index in Costa Rica was launched in March 2016.",
              "It measures the well-being of people in tourist destinations, serving as an indicator to better promote and establish public-private partnerships, and to foster social progress and sustainable, inclusive economic growth.",
              "A key aspect of the project is the use of new methodologies to measure the sustainability of destinations.",
              "Tailor-made indicators reflect the integral and multidimensional nature of tourism and the particularities of each territory.",
              "The Social Progress Index enables the Tourism Board to not only assess the areas of strengths and weaknesses of each tourist destination, but also to develop collaborative and cross-sectional strategies in order to align social investments, focus resources, and co-ordinate interventions, with local governments, other ministries and national institutions, firms, touristic businesses and civil society.",
              "Therefore, this platform is a milestone for the tourism sector of Costa Rica, in that it generates a data-based decision-making platform geared towards inclusive growth aligned with the 2030 global agenda.",
              "Another important element of this process is understanding resident perceptions on the impact and value of tourism.",
              "For example, in 2019, UNWTO and Ipsos undertook a global survey of 12 000 respondents from 15 countries, to better understand residents\u2019 perceptions towards city tourism, its impacts and management strategies.",
              "Key findings from the survey show that 47% of respondents think they live in cities with high numbers of tourists, with 52% indicating that tourism has a moderate or big impact in generating wealth and income.",
              "Conversely, nearly half (46%) thought tourism \u2018creates overcrowding\u2019, while a similar number (49%) indicating that measures should be implemented to better manage tourism, including improved infrastructure and facilities (72%), creating experiences and attractions that benefit both residents and visitors (71%), and ensuring that the local community benefits from tourism (65%).",
              "Similar \u2018mood of the nation\u2019 surveys are being undertaken at the country level (e.",
              "g. Australia and New Zealand) to assess resident perceptions concerning the size and value of tourism and feed into development and management plans.",
              "Moving forward, a more analytical approach to understanding i) the impact and total cost of managing each tourist during their stay in a destination, and ii) resident perceptions of tourism\u2019s impact and value, should be a priority consideration for communities and policy makers.",
              "Adopting such an approach would enable more informed decisions as destinations strive to determine the appropriate or desired balance between the short-term economic opportunities afforded by the rapidly growing travel and tourism sector, and the long-term resilience of its human, natural and cultural resources (WEF, 2019).",
              "Based on the above analysis, it is clear that for many countries, regions and destinations, tourism growth remains economically, socially and environmentally unbalanced, often as a result of rapid and unplanned growth in visitor numbers, which can negatively affect not only the tourist experience, but also the environment and host communities upon which tourism depends.",
              "It is also clear, however, that there is no one-size fits all solution, as the opportunities and challenges for tourism development will vary depending on the unique characteristics of individual destinations within and between countries.",
              "Building on the analysis within the chapter, outlined below are a selection of key policy considerations to address increased pressure on those destinations experiencing unbalanced tourism growth.",
              "Such considerations can provide existing and emerging destinations with the tools to help avoid potential pitfalls as they strive to strike a balance between the benefits and costs associated with tourism development, and implement a sustainable vision for the future.",
              "Rethink tourism success.",
              "A paradigm shift in perceptions of tourism \u2018success\u2019 is required across all levels of government and on behalf of all stakeholders, with a greater focus on the environmental and socio-cultural pillars of sustainability.",
              "Success should not be judged on visitor numbers alone, but rather from a more holistic perspective that considers the positive impacts that tourism can deliver at the destination level.",
              "In addition to economic benefits, adopting such a philosophy would help to deliver net benefits to local communities and indigenous peoples, contribute to achieving the SDGs, and combat climate change.",
              "Adopt an integrated policy-industry-community approach.",
              "It is imperative that tourism is treated as only one component of a diverse economy.",
              "Policy makers need to ensure that efforts to grow tourism are pursued within the wider context of relevant city, regional, and wider economic development strategies, and in close co-operation with industry and civil society.",
              "Horizontal and vertical policy co-ordination, and closer integration of multiple policies to support a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to sustainable tourism growth is needed to spread the benefits of tourism both spatially and temporally.",
              "Due to the evolving nature of multi-level governance systems, a periodic review of jurisdictional responsibilities should be made to ensure flexibility in the system.",
              "Mainstream sustainable policies and practices.",
              "Policy makers should take additional steps to mainstream the concept of sustainability in tourism policies and industry practices, to better support the transition to a green, low-emissions and climate-resilient tourism economy.",
              "Long-term strategies and objectives should have a clear sustainability focus and clear linkages to the SDG targets.",
              "A more comprehensive understanding of tourism value chains will help to identify opportunities for incremental improvement and capacity building needs.",
              "Adopting a circular economy approach presents an opportunity for tourism businesses and more specifically SMEs to enhance innovation and achieve resource efficiency with a system-wide approach along the entire value chain, and there is a clear role for governments to play in facilitating this process.",
              "Better measurement for better management.",
              "Together, the spatial and temporal dimensions of tourism are fundamental in any effort to characterise and study tourism in a given territory.",
              "Countries require a system of tourism information and statistics that produces robust and timely data that is sufficiently disaggregated and comparable at the regional and national level.",
              "Moving forward, countries should adopt a more analytical approach to understanding short and long term environmental, social and economic impacts of tourism development, including the financial costs of managing tourists during their stay, in order to more effectively inform the decision-making process and to determine the desired type and scale of tourism appropriate for individual destinations.",
              "As part of this process, policy makers should continue to explore opportunities to combine conventional statistical data, with emerging, big data sources, to enhance its spatial and temporal granularity.",
              "Develop a forward looking agenda.",
              "To achieve long-term sustainable tourism development, governments at all levels would benefit from developing comprehensive long-term plans that extend beyond the political cycle.",
              "These strategies should provide the certainty that businesses require, while being agile enough to emerging realities.",
              "They should consider the potential impacts of policies on future generations and take responsible actions in the present.",
              "An ongoing dialogue between government, local communities and industry, utilising regular feedback mechanisms can play an important role in identifying opportunities and challenges as they arise, and in developing policy responses to adapt as necessary.",
              "Finally, as the world becomes increasingly globalised and enabling technologies continue to facilitate connections, policy makers cannot operate in silos and must collaborate internationally to ensure that the gains from tourism are inclusive and equitable, and that policies and decisions are globally sustainable.",

              "As the type of protected area with the highest and most representative OUV in the world [2, 3], how to pass on the value of the world heritage through heritage display and solve the livelihood problem of the residents is a problem worthy of study.",
              "For many years after the birth of Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (World Heritage Convention) in 1972, conservation was the sole goal of World Heritage, but as time passed, World Heritage gradually established its status as an important tourist destination, and UNESCO\u2019s policy on World Heritage also no longer limited to conservation, but also sustainable tourism [4].",
              "The purpose of heritage conservation is to preserve their OUV and pass them on intact to the next generation [5].",

              "Socio-economically, tourism is considered a vital means of sustainable human development worldwide, and remains one of the world\u2019s top creators of employment and a lead income-generator, particularly for Global South countries [1].",
              "For most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), tourism is a key component of export earnings and export diversification, and a major source of foreign-currency income [1].",
              "In 2019, prior to the international travel restrictions implemented to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), export revenues from international tourism were estimated at USD 1.",
              "7 trillion, the world\u2019s third largest export category after fuels and chemicals with great economic impacts.",
              "Tourism remains a major part of gross domestic product, generating millions of direct and indirect jobs, and helping LMICs reduce trade deficits [1].",
              "It accounts for 28 per cent of the world\u2019s trade in services, 7 per cent of overall exports of goods and services and 1 out of 10 jobs in the world [1].",
              "Given this, it is anticipated that tourism will play a strong role in achieving all of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but particularly Goals 1 (No poverty), 8 (Decent work and economic growth), 12 (Responsible consumption and production), 13 (Climate action) and 14 (Life below water).",
              "To ensure tourism\u2019s continued contribution to sustainable development efforts, the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) has established the T4SDG platform in order to \u201cto make tourism matter on the journey to 2030\u201d [2].",
              "Likewise, in recognition of the relationship between heritage, tourism, and sustainable development, UNESCO launched the World Heritage and Sustainable Tourism Programme, which was adopted by the World Heritage Committee in 2012.",
              "This Programme encapsulates a framework that builds on dialogue and stakeholder cooperation to promote an integrated approach to planning for tourism and heritage management in host countries, to protect and value natural and cultural assets, and develop appropriate and sustainable tourism pathways [3].",
              "The addition of \u2018heritage\u2019 creates an important sub-category within the tourism industry: heritage tourism.",
              "This study adopts a broad definition of \u2018heritage\u2019, which encompasses the intersecting forms of tangible heritage, such as buildings, monuments, and works of art, intangible or living heritage, including folklore, cultural memories, celebrations and traditions, and natural heritage, or culturally infused landscapes and places of significant biodiversity [4].",
              "This encompassing definition captures \u2018heritage\u2019 as it is understood at the international level, as evidenced by two key UNESCO conventions: the 1972 Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, which protects cultural, natural, and mixed heritage;",
              "and the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, which protects intangible heritage.",
              "Although the identification, conservation and management of heritage has traditionally been driven by national aspirations to preserve connections with history, ancestry, and national identity, the social and economic benefits of heritage tourism at community levels have also been documented [5].",
              "Heritage tourism, as one of the oldest practices of travelling for leisure, is a significant sector of the tourism industry.",
              "It refers to the practice of visiting places because of their connections to cultural, natural, and intangible heritage and is oriented towards showcasing notable relationships to a shared past at a given tourism destination [4].",
              "It contributes to global interchange and inter-cultural understanding [4].",
              "Heritage tourism places economic and political value on recognised heritage resources and assets, providing additional reasons to conserve heritage further to the cultural imperatives for its maintenance [5].",
              "By drawing on the cultural and historical capital of a community, heritage tourism can contribute to the flourishing of local communities and their positive sustainable development.",
              "However, as this systematic review will demonstrate, when applied uncritically and without meaningful engagement with the needs of local stakeholder, heritage tourism can also elicit damaging effects on community health and wellbeing.",
              "First published in 1987, the classic report \u2018Our Common Future\u2019, more commonly known as the Brundtland Report, conceptualised sustainable development as \u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d [6].",
              "Although this definition still works for many purposes, it emphasised the critical issues of environment and development whilst turning on the undefined implications of the word \u2018needs\u2019.",
              "In the report, the concept of sustainable development thus left unspecified the assumed importance of distinct cultural, political, economic, and ecological needs as well as health needs.",
              "Drawing on the work of globalization and cultural diversity scholar, Paul James [7], in this study we have defined \u2018positive sustainable development\u2019 as those \u201cpractices and meanings of human engagement that make for lifeworlds that project the ongoing probability of natural and social flourishing\u201d, taking into account questions of vitality, relationality, productivity and sustainability.",
              "For many years, the impact of heritage tourism has predominantly been viewed through ecological [8, 9], economic and cultural [10, 11] or political [12] lenses.",
              "For example, it has often been assumed that the conservation of historic, cultural, and natural resources, in combination with tourism, will naturally lead to sustainable local economies through increases in employment opportunities, provisioning of a platform for profitable new business opportunities, investment in infrastructure, improving public utilities and transport infrastructures, supporting the protection of natural resources, and, more recently, improving quality of life for local residents [13\u201315].",
              "Similarly, the impact of heritage tourism on health and wellbeing has tended to focus on visitors\u2019 wellbeing, including their health education and possible health trends, medical aspects of travel preparation, and health problems in returning tourists [16\u201318].",
              "It has only been more recently that host communities\u2019 health needs and wellbeing have been recognised as an intrinsic part of cultural heritage management and sustainable community development [19].",
              "In this literature, it has been hypothesised that potential health implications of heritage tourism are either indirect or direct.",
              "Indirect effects are predominantly associated with health gains from heritage tourism-related economic, environmental, socio-cultural, and political impacts [20].",
              "In contrast, health implications associated with direct impacts are closely associated with immediate encounters between tourism and people [20].",
              "Yet, little is known of the overall generative effects of heritage tourism on sustainable community development, or the long-term health and wellbeing of local communities.",
              "For the first time, this systematic review identified and evaluated 102 published and unpublished studies in order to assess the extent to which heritage tourism fosters host communities\u2019 participation and, consequently, their capacity to flourish, with emphasis placed on the long-term health impacts of this.",
              "The primary objective of the review was to determine: (1) what the impacts of heritage tourism are on sustainable community development;",
              "as well as (2) on the health and wellbeing of local host communities.",
              "Understanding the relationship between heritage tourism, sustainable community development and health is essential in influencing policies aimed at improving overall livelihood in local host communities, as well as informing intervention strategies and knowledge advancement.",
              "This systematic review adhered to the guidelines and criteria set out in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement [21].",
              "A protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018114681) and has been published [22].",
              "In order to avoid replicating an already existing study on this topic, Cochrane library, Google Scholar and Scopus were searched to ensure there were no previous systematic reviews or meta-analyses on the impact of heritage tourism on sustainable community development and the health of local host communities.",
              "No such reviews or analyses were found.",
              "The search then sought to use a list of relevant text words and sub-headings of keywords and/or MeSH vocabulary according to each searched database.",
              "Derived from the above research question, the key search words were related to heritage tourism, sustainable community development, and health and wellbeing of local host communities.",
              "A trial search of our selected databases (see below) found that there are no MeSH words for heritage and tourism.",
              "Therefore, multiple keywords were included to identify relevant articles.",
              "To obtain more focused and productive results, the keywords were linked using \u201cAND\u201d and \u201cOR\u201d and other relevant Boolean operators, where permitted by the databases.",
              "Subject heading truncations (*) were applied where appropriate.",
              "The search query was developed and tested in ProQuest Central on 22 November 2018.",
              "Following this search trial, the following combination of search terms and keywords, slightly modified to suit each database, was subsequently used: (\u201cHeritage tourism\u201d OR tourism OR \u201cworld heritage site\u201d OR ecotourism OR \u201cheritage based tourism\u201d OR \u201ccultural tourism\u201d OR \u201cdiaspora tourism\u201d OR \u201ccultural heritage tourism\u201d OR \u201ccultural resource management\u201d OR \u201ccultural heritage management\u201d OR \u201chistoric site\u201d) AND (\u201cHealth status\u201d [MeSH] OR \u201chealth equity\u201d OR health OR community health OR welfare OR wellbeing) AND (\u201csustainable development\u201d [MeSH] OR sustainab* or \u201ccommunity development\u201d or \u201clocal development\u201d or \u201clocal community\u201d or \u201cindigenous community\u201d) The search covered the following bibliographic databases and electronic collections: In addition, grey literature were also sourced from key organisation websites including the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM), the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), the International Council of Museums (ICOM), the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) and the Smithsonian Institution.",
              "Where the full texts of included articles could not be accessed, corresponding authors were contacted via e-mail or other means of communication (e.",
              "g., ResearchGate) to obtain a copy.",
              "A further search of the bibliographical references of all retrieved articles and articles\u2019 citation tracking using Google Scholar was conducted to capture relevant articles that might have been missed during the initial search but that meet the inclusion criteria.",
              "For the purposes of transparency and accountability, a search log was kept and constantly updated to ensure that newly published articles were captured.",
              "To maximise the accuracy of the search, two researchers with extensive knowledge of heritage tourism literature (EW and HS) and two research assistants with backgrounds in public health and social sciences implemented independently the search syntax across the databases and organisations\u2019 websites to ensure no article was missed.",
              "Criteria used in this systematic review focused on the types of beneficiaries of heritage tourism, outcomes of interest, as well as the intervention designs.",
              "The outcomes of interest were sustainable community development and evidence for the overall health and wellbeing of local host communities.",
              "In this systematic review, sustainable community development was defined in terms of its two components: \u2018community sustainability\u2019 and \u2018development\u2019.",
              "Community sustainability was conceptualised as the \u201clong-term durability of a community as it negotiates changing practices and meanings across all the domains of culture, politics, economics and ecology\u201d (pp.",
              "21, 24) [23].",
              "In contrast, development was conceptualised as \u201csocial change\u2014with all its intended or unintended outcomes, good and bad\u2014that brings about a significant and patterned shift in the technologies, techniques, infrastructure, and/or associated life-forms of a place or people\u201d (p.",
              "44) [7].",

              "Of greater concern is the finding of this review that of the relatively small number of papers investigating cultural health determinants, many recorded profoundly negative and traumatising outcomes of tourism development, such as a rise of ethnoreligious conflict, loss of ancestral land, a dilution of cultural practices to meet tourist demands, and a loss of cultural authenticity [41].",
              "Consequently, comparative studies that focus on cultural determinants, in addition to economic and environmental determinants, are currently lacking and should therefore be prioritised in future research.",
              "In fact, only one fifth of those papers included in this review adopted the qualitative approach needed to probe the socio-cultural dimensions of health.",
              "Novel qualitative research methods to investigate community health are therefore a major research lacuna.",
              "Just as solely equating community health and wellbeing with economic flourishing is problematic, so too is assuming that health is reducible only to clinical care and disease [146], given that \"[i]deas about health .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "are cultural\u201d [146].",
              "Early indications of an acceptance that culture and heritage might be central to community health and wellbeing can be found in UNESCO\u2019s 1995 report, Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development [147].",
              "More recently, this notion is evidenced in the 2019 Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention [148] and the 2020 Operational Directives for UNESCO\u2019s Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage [149], both of which indicate the need for a major shift in research foci towards cultural determinants of health and wellbeing if research is to keep pace with assumptions now operating within international policy [148, 149].",
              "Although Africa, Europe and the Americas are the three regions with the highest proportion of papers investigating the economic benefits of tourism on health and wellbeing, these regions are also the most responsive to the above recommended changes in policy and debate (see Table 3).",
              "In these three regions, the proportion of outputs investigating economic health determinants since 2019 is the smallest, demonstrating a recent decline in research that is persuaded by the a priori assumption that economic wellbeing automatically equates to cultural wellbeing.",
              "Despite demonstrating the most holistic approach to understanding health and wellbeing across all the themes, an upwards trend in economy-focused research was identified in South-East Asia, since more than half of the economic outputs were produced in the last two years.",
              "Such a trend is potentially problematic for this region because it may reinforce the notion that the main benefits of tourism are direct and financial, rather than refocusing on the tension created by indirect effects of tourism on quality of life and community wellbeing.",
              "Conversely, this review demonstrates that the Western Pacific region has persisted with research focused on the economic drivers of wellbeing in relation to heritage tourism (see Table 3).",
              "This persistence may be explained by the relative lack of participation (either as researchers or stakeholders) by local communities in any of the studies included in this review (see Table 4).",
              "Indeed, the Western Pacific had the lowest occurrence of community participation and/or consultation in establishing indicators of wellbeing and health and/or opinions about the role of tourism in promoting these.",
              "On the contrary, while seemingly demonstrating the second highest proportion of exclusionary research methods as discussed above, South-East Asia remains the only region where any attempts were made to ensure community members were invited to design and co-lead research (see Table 4).",
              "Nonetheless, meaningful modes of participation in this region were found to be more closely in line with the deficits found in Africa, Europe, and the Americas.",
              "This lack of approaches aimed at including affected communities as researchers in all but one instance in South-East Asia is an important research gap in tourism studies\u2019 engagement with health and wellbeing debates.",
              "Importantly, this failure to adequately engage with affected communities is at odds with the depth of research emanating from a range of health disciplines, such as disability studies, occupational therapy, public health, and midwifery, where the slogan \u2018nothing about us without us\u2019, which emerged in the 1980s, remains prominent.",
              "Coupled with a lack of focus on cultural determinants of health, this lack of participation and community direction strongly indicates that research studies are being approached with an a priori notion about what \u2018wellbeing\u2019 means to local communities, and risks limiting the relevance and accuracy of the research that is being undertaken.",
              "Problematically, therefore, there is a tendency to envisage a \u2018package\u2019 of wellbeing and health benefits that tourism can potentially bring to a community (regardless of cultural background), with research focusing on identifying the presence or absence of elements of this assumed, overarching \u2018package\u2019.",
              "Interestingly, along with the paucity of full and meaningful collaboration with local community hosts in tourism research, there were no instances across the systematic review where a longitudinal approach was adopted.",
              "This observation reinforces the point that long-term, collaborative explorations of culturally specific concepts including such things as \u2018welfare\u2019, \u2018benefit\u2019, \u2018healthfulness\u2019 and \u2018flourishing\u2019, or combinations of these, are lacking across all regions.",
              "To bring tourism research more in line with broader debates and international policy directions about wellbeing, it is important for future research that the qualities of health and wellbeing in a particular cultural setting are investigated as a starting point, and culturally suitable approaches are designed (with local researchers) to best examine the effects of tourism on these contingent notions of wellbeing.",
              "Importantly, a lack of longitudinal research will lead to a gap in our understanding about whether the negative impacts of tourism increase or compound over time.",
              "Adopting these ethnographies of health and wellbeing hinges upon long-term community partnerships that will serve to redress a research gap into the longevity of heritage tourism impacts.",
              "Furthermore, of those papers that asked local community members about their perceptions of heritage tourism across all regions, a common finding was the desire for greater decision-making and management of the enterprises as stakeholders.",
              "It seems ironic, therefore, that research into heritage tourism perceptions itself commonly invites the bare minimum of collaboration to establish the parameters of that research.",
              "In a small number of papers that invited community opinions, local stakeholders considered that the tourism \u2018benefits package\u2019 myth should be dispelled, and that responsible tourism development should only happen as part of a wider suite of livelihood options, such as agriculture, so that economic diversity is maintained.",
              "Such a multi-livelihood framework would also promote the accessibility of benefits for more of the community, and this poses a significant new direction for tourism research.",
              "For example, an outcome of the review was the observation that infrastructure development is often directed towards privileged tourism livelihood options [150], but a more holistic framework would distribute these sorts of benefits to also co-develop other livelihoods.",
              "Although there is a clear interest in understanding the relationship between heritage, tourism, health and wellbeing, future research that explores the intersections of heritage tourism with multiple health domains, in particular social and cultural domains, is critical.",
              "Indeed, the frequency with which the negative impacts of heritage tourism were reported in the small number of studies that engaged local community participants suggests that studies co-designed with community participants are a necessary future direction in order for academics, policymakers and professionals working in the field of heritage tourism to more adequately address the scarce knowledge about its socio-cultural impacts.",
              "The accepted importance of community researchers in cognate fields underscores that the knowledge, presence and skills of affected communities are vital and points to the need for similar studies in heritage tourism.",
              "There are five main findings of this systematic review, each of which is a critical gap in research that should be addressed to support the health and wellbeing in local communities at tourism destinations.",
              "Firstly, whilst one of the primary findings of this systematic review was the increase in employment opportunities resulting from tourism, this disclosure arose because of a strong\u2013in many cases, exclusive\u2013methodological focus on economic indicators of health and wellbeing.",
              "Such research reveals that heritage tourism may significantly reduce poverty and may be used as a poverty-reducing strategy in low-income countries.",
              "However, the assumption underlying this focus on the economic benefits of tourism for health and wellbeing is that economic benefits are a proxy for other determinants of health, e.",
              "g., cultural, social, environmental, etc.",
              ", which are otherwise less systematically explored.",
              "In particular, the ways in which combinations of environmental, social, cultural, and economic determinants on wellbeing interact is an area requires considerable future research.",
              "Secondly, whilst economic drivers of wellbeing were the most common area of research across all regions, the impacts of tourism on cultural wellbeing were the least explored.",
              "Moreover, in many publications culture was entirely omitted.",
              "This is perhaps one of the most troubling outcomes of this systematic review, because in the relatively small number of papers that did investigate the cultural impacts of tourism, many reported traumatising consequences for local communities, the documentation of which would not be recorded in the majority of papers where cultural wellbeing was absent.",
              "Tourism\u2019s profoundly damaging consequences included reports of a rise in ethnoreligious violence, loss of ancestral land and the threat of forced relocation, not to mentioned extensive reports of cultural atrophy.",
              "Linked to this lack of understanding about the cultural impacts of tourism on wellbeing, the third finding of this review is that there are far fewer studies that incorporate qualitative data, more suited to document intangible cultural changes, whether positive or negative.",
              "Furthermore, more longitudinal research is also needed to address the subtle impacts of tourism acting over longer timescales.",
              "The systematic review revealed a lack of understanding about how both the negative and positive outcomes of heritage tourism change over time, whether by increasing, ameliorating, or compounding.",
              "The fourth finding of this research is that, to a degree and in certain regions of the world, research is responding to international policy.",
              "This review has illustrated that, historically, Africa, Europe and the Americas prioritised research that measured the economic effects of tourism on health and wellbeing.",
              "However, after 2019 a shift occurred towards a growing but still under-represented interest in social-cultural wellbeing.",
              "We propose that this shift aligns with recommendations from UNESCO\u2019s 2019 Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention [148] and the 2020 Operational Directives for UNESCO\u2019s Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage [149].",
              "The exception to this shift is the Western Pacific region, where the economic impacts of tourism are increasingly prioritised as the main indicator of wellbeing.",
              "Given the overall efficacy of policy for steering towards ethical and culturally-grounded evaluations of the impacts of tourism, we would urge heritage policymakers to take account of our recommendations (Table 2).",
              "The policy implications emerging from this review are the fifth finding and can be distilled into a few key propositions.",
              "There is a need for meaningful decolonising approaches to heritage tourism.",
              "More than half of the negative consequences of heritage tourism for health and wellbeing could be mitigated with policy guidance, contingent cultural protocols and anti-colonial methods that foreground the rights of local (including Indigenous) communities to design, govern, lead, and establish the terms of tourism in their local area.",
              "Although \u2018participation\u2019 has become a popular term that invokes an idea of power symmetries in tourism enterprises, it is clear from this systematic review that the term leaves too much latitude for the creep of poor-practice [151] that ultimately erodes community autonomy and self-determination.",
              "Participation is not enough if it means that there is scope for governments and foreign investors to superficially engage with community wellbeing needs and concerns.",
              "Furthermore, calls for \u2018capacity-building\u2019 that effectively re-engineer the knowledges of local communities are fundamentally problematic because they presuppose a missing competency or knowledge.",
              "This is at odds with impassioned anti-colonial advocacy [152] which recognises that communities hold a range of knowledges and cultural assets that they may, and should be legally protected to, deploy (or not) as a culturally-suitable foundation that steers the design of locally-governed tourism enterprises.",
              "In short, to maximise and extend the benefits of heritage tourism and address major social determinants of health, host communities\u2019 presence in heritage tourism governance, decision making processes, and control of and access to the resultant community resources and programs must be a priority.",
              "Future policymakers are encouraged to make guidance more explicit, enforceable and provision avenues for feedback from local communities that offers the protections of transparency.",
              "It is also imperative that researchers involve and empower local community groups as part of studies conducted in relation to their health and wellbeing.",
              "If current practices remain unchanged, the primary benefit of tourism could easily be rendered inaccessible through lack of education and/or appropriate training which was frequently identified as a barrier to community participation.",

              "Thus, BORDA Counting technique offers the opportunity to combine rankings created with more than one technique into a single ranking (Wu 2011).",
              "It accepts each technique with equal importance for classification performance, while also offering convenience in terms of applicability (Akyuz and Salih 2017).",
              "In the ranking of the alternatives, the best alternative is m\u22121, the second-best alternative is m\u22122, and the worst alternative is scored as 0.",
              "By adding new values, BORDA count score is obtained and sorting is performed (Lansdowne and Woodward 1996).",
              "In the Equation below, \\( m\\) is the total number of alternatives, for \\( (r_{ik} )\\) k is criterion and i refers to the rank of the alternative.",
              "The final ranking using BORDA is shown in Table 7.",
              "According to the final ranking, the sites with the highest level of danger are \u201cLake Malawi National Park\u201d, \u201cHistoric Sanctuary of Machu Picchu\u201d and \u201cNational Park of Phong Nha-Ke Bang\u201d.",
              "\u201cAtlantic Forest Southeast Reserves\u201d, \u201cSinharaja Forest Reserve\u201d and \u201cVredefort Dome\u201d took the last place among a total of 24 sites.",
              "Detailed findings on the most critically threatened sites and their current status are presented as SF.",
              "Aim of this study was to determine the level of danger created by tourism activities in natural areas, which are at the level of significant concern in the UNESCO WHL and where tourism activities are perceived as a threat.",
              "24 NHS were analyzed by MCDM methods using the following criteria: visitor numbers, number of accommodation facilities, impact of tourism, impact of tourism on infrastructure, tourism and visitor management, size of the area, species number in flora and fauna, year of registration in the UNESCO list, financial aids, report score, and general assessment of threats.",
              "Findings of TOPSIS, MOORA, and VIKOR techniques were re-examined in the BORDA method and final ranking was obtained.",
              "According to the results of the study, the NHS with the highest level of danger are \"Lake Malawi National Park\", \"Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu\" and \"National Park of Phong Nha-Ke Bang \", while \"Atlantic Forest Southeast Reserves\", \"Sinharaja Forest Reserve\" and \" Vredefort Dome\u201d were found to be the least affected sites.",
              "When the current situation of the affected natural areas is examined, the effects of tourism can be clearly seen.",
              "In recent years, various threats have increased in Lake Malawi, primarily due to the increase in the human population related to tourism activities in the region, oil resource potential, changing climate and implementation of altered management plan.",
              "Therefore, there is a necessity for monitoring systems to assess threats\u2019 trends and status, while the heritage values remain mostly intact.",
              "While tourism facilities around Lake Malawi make efforts to minimize the environmental impacts, the increase in the tourist numbers and permanent residents cannot be prevented from posing a pollution threat.",
              "Other impacts of tourism contain increased degradation of nearshore fish sets due to boat noise and scuba divers, as well as the loss of local culture and tradition (Harding et al.",
              "2018).",
              "Since its inclusion in the WHL, Machu Picchu has witnessed activities such as deforestation and commercial plant gathering, poor waste management, poaching, and the prevalence of agricultural use due to the absence of open land tenure regulations for the development of tourism.",
              "In addition, these events cause the deterioration of the ecosystem in the region through water pollution from both urban waste and agriculture.",
              "For Phong Nha-Ke Bang, the threat of increased over-reliance on income from tourism remains.",
              "In addition, a distinct benefit-sharing in local communities is not adopted yet.",
              "However, while the conservation of caves has been consistently successful, the report about Reactive Monitoring Mission in 2018 states that waste product accumulated in Paradise Cave draws mice and rats posing a considerable menace to the cave (UNESCO and IUCN 2018).",
              "Lately, activities that are of great interest to visitors, such as caving and kayaking experiences, mud baths, an expanding zip-line system, and the expansion of a water playground in Nuoc Mooc Eco cave, indicate that tourism poses a threat.",
              "Understanding the responsibilities of the World Heritage Convention is fundamental for decision-making and policy.",
              "Operational Guidelines have a major impact on tourism management and provide operable guidance on responsibilities.",
              "World Heritage network tenders unique chances, and it has a great number of beneficial resources for tourism managers (Pedersen 2002).",
              "Environmental protection and tourism development in key heritage sites often involve multiple stakeholders.",
              "Topics such as WHS assignment, marketing, interpretation, revenue generation and visitor management are often controversial and complex.",
              "The responsibility is vital in managing these appropriately and ensuring the resources are not harmed by visitors, environmental conditions, or conflicts of interest.",
              "The clearest way to balance conservation use activities is to include them effectively in management plans and recognizing management practices that can be used to maximize or control the benefits.",
              "Thus, it is important to integrate WHS management into land management and tourism plans at local, regional, and national levels.",
              "Indeed, Balmford et al.",
              "(2001) states that future conflicts between development and conservation cannot be easily avoided, and that the conservation of reserves in regions with high population will become increasingly difficult.",
              "For the benefit of both heritage sites and tourism industry, joint planning of conservation and tourism is inevitable, as tourism itself represents a remarkable threat for conversation in some regions.",
              "Additional funds for the management and monitoring of sites and visitors can be provided.",
              "Besides UNESCO donations, tourism tax or government funds may play a key role in supporting the regional tourism industry.",
              "Although usually quite delicate, the effects caused by tourists are generally avoidable (e.",
              "g., visitors may be requested not to feed animals).",
              "On the other hand, it may be difficult to determine the cause-effect relationships of tourism effects.",
              "Garbage may be disposed of by residents, not tourists, or water pollution may stem from sources other than hotels, coastal areas may suffer from natural events rather than tourism, hunting by locals may explain the declining amount of biodiversity.",
              "Therefore, it is recommended to consider such effects when preparing status reports for heritage sites.",
              "While visitor capacity is a particularly serious issue for natural areas in terms of sustainability, solutions for decreasing numbers in the area may not always be impressive.",
              "Since effects are related to complex socio-environmental parameters and developmental patterns, it is important to understand the interrelationships that may facilitate locals in hosting tourists or cause strong opposition to their presence.",
              "Relatively all WHS are associated with their 'local communities'.",
              "Therefore, for tourism activities, visitor areas should be carefully planned and WHS visitors should not interfere with the daily lives of local people or their ties with WHS (ICOMOS 1999).",
              "The authorities are advised to adopt a prevalent policy aiming to give natural and cultural heritage a function in daily life of residents and to integrate heritage conservation into comprehensive planning programs (Jimura 2018).",
              "As with many studies, this study also has limitations.",
              "The limitations of the study are;",
              "(1) the selection of sites where tourism is seen as dangerous for the NHS and (2) the conservation outlook level is seen as significant concern, (3) the use of secondary data, and (4) the selection of MCDM techniques for the method.",
              "According to these limitations the authors offer some suggestions for future studies.",
              "Firstly, the authors had difficulty choosing variables to study tourism effects on sites, despite using UNESCO data.",
              "Therefore, determining the variables for a more detailed examination of tourism effects in future studies and considering the studies in a wider framework (other effects besides tourism) will contribute to the literature.",
              "Secondly, methodological triangulation (longitudinal, cross-sectional, and mixed patterns) can be recommended to explain the subject in more detail, as MCDM techniques cannot explain the variable relations in an interpretive sense.",
              "Lastly, with the approach adopted in this study, the impact of tourism on cultural heritage sites can be evaluated.",

              "Socio-economically, tourism is considered a vital means of sustainable human development worldwide, and remains one of the world\u2019s top creators of employment and a lead income-generator, particularly for Global South countries [1].",
              "For most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), tourism is a key component of export earnings and export diversification, and a major source of foreign-currency income [1].",
              "In 2019, prior to the international travel restrictions implemented to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), export revenues from international tourism were estimated at USD 1.",
              "7 trillion, the world\u2019s third largest export category after fuels and chemicals with great economic impacts.",
              "Tourism remains a major part of gross domestic product, generating millions of direct and indirect jobs, and helping LMICs reduce trade deficits [1].",
              "It accounts for 28 per cent of the world\u2019s trade in services, 7 per cent of overall exports of goods and services and 1 out of 10 jobs in the world [1].",
              "Given this, it is anticipated that tourism will play a strong role in achieving all of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but particularly Goals 1 (No poverty), 8 (Decent work and economic growth), 12 (Responsible consumption and production), 13 (Climate action) and 14 (Life below water).",
              "To ensure tourism\u2019s continued contribution to sustainable development efforts, the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) has established the T4SDG platform in order to \u201cto make tourism matter on the journey to 2030\u201d [2].",
              "Likewise, in recognition of the relationship between heritage, tourism, and sustainable development, UNESCO launched the World Heritage and Sustainable Tourism Programme, which was adopted by the World Heritage Committee in 2012.",
              "This Programme encapsulates a framework that builds on dialogue and stakeholder cooperation to promote an integrated approach to planning for tourism and heritage management in host countries, to protect and value natural and cultural assets, and develop appropriate and sustainable tourism pathways [3].",
              "The addition of \u2018heritage\u2019 creates an important sub-category within the tourism industry: heritage tourism.",
              "This study adopts a broad definition of \u2018heritage\u2019, which encompasses the intersecting forms of tangible heritage, such as buildings, monuments, and works of art, intangible or living heritage, including folklore, cultural memories, celebrations and traditions, and natural heritage, or culturally infused landscapes and places of significant biodiversity [4].",
              "This encompassing definition captures \u2018heritage\u2019 as it is understood at the international level, as evidenced by two key UNESCO conventions: the 1972 Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, which protects cultural, natural, and mixed heritage;",
              "and the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, which protects intangible heritage.",
              "Although the identification, conservation and management of heritage has traditionally been driven by national aspirations to preserve connections with history, ancestry, and national identity, the social and economic benefits of heritage tourism at community levels have also been documented [5].",
              "Heritage tourism, as one of the oldest practices of travelling for leisure, is a significant sector of the tourism industry.",
              "It refers to the practice of visiting places because of their connections to cultural, natural, and intangible heritage and is oriented towards showcasing notable relationships to a shared past at a given tourism destination [4].",
              "It contributes to global interchange and inter-cultural understanding [4].",
              "Heritage tourism places economic and political value on recognised heritage resources and assets, providing additional reasons to conserve heritage further to the cultural imperatives for its maintenance [5].",
              "By drawing on the cultural and historical capital of a community, heritage tourism can contribute to the flourishing of local communities and their positive sustainable development.",
              "However, as this systematic review will demonstrate, when applied uncritically and without meaningful engagement with the needs of local stakeholder, heritage tourism can also elicit damaging effects on community health and wellbeing.",
              "First published in 1987, the classic report \u2018Our Common Future\u2019, more commonly known as the Brundtland Report, conceptualised sustainable development as \u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u201d [6].",
              "Although this definition still works for many purposes, it emphasised the critical issues of environment and development whilst turning on the undefined implications of the word \u2018needs\u2019.",
              "In the report, the concept of sustainable development thus left unspecified the assumed importance of distinct cultural, political, economic, and ecological needs as well as health needs.",
              "Drawing on the work of globalization and cultural diversity scholar, Paul James [7], in this study we have defined \u2018positive sustainable development\u2019 as those \u201cpractices and meanings of human engagement that make for lifeworlds that project the ongoing probability of natural and social flourishing\u201d, taking into account questions of vitality, relationality, productivity and sustainability.",
              "For many years, the impact of heritage tourism has predominantly been viewed through ecological [8, 9], economic and cultural [10, 11] or political [12] lenses.",
              "For example, it has often been assumed that the conservation of historic, cultural, and natural resources, in combination with tourism, will naturally lead to sustainable local economies through increases in employment opportunities, provisioning of a platform for profitable new business opportunities, investment in infrastructure, improving public utilities and transport infrastructures, supporting the protection of natural resources, and, more recently, improving quality of life for local residents [13\u201315].",
              "Similarly, the impact of heritage tourism on health and wellbeing has tended to focus on visitors\u2019 wellbeing, including their health education and possible health trends, medical aspects of travel preparation, and health problems in returning tourists [16\u201318].",
              "It has only been more recently that host communities\u2019 health needs and wellbeing have been recognised as an intrinsic part of cultural heritage management and sustainable community development [19].",
              "In this literature, it has been hypothesised that potential health implications of heritage tourism are either indirect or direct.",
              "Indirect effects are predominantly associated with health gains from heritage tourism-related economic, environmental, socio-cultural, and political impacts [20].",
              "In contrast, health implications associated with direct impacts are closely associated with immediate encounters between tourism and people [20].",
              "Yet, little is known of the overall generative effects of heritage tourism on sustainable community development, or the long-term health and wellbeing of local communities.",
              "For the first time, this systematic review identified and evaluated 102 published and unpublished studies in order to assess the extent to which heritage tourism fosters host communities\u2019 participation and, consequently, their capacity to flourish, with emphasis placed on the long-term health impacts of this.",
              "The primary objective of the review was to determine: (1) what the impacts of heritage tourism are on sustainable community development;",
              "as well as (2) on the health and wellbeing of local host communities.",
              "Understanding the relationship between heritage tourism, sustainable community development and health is essential in influencing policies aimed at improving overall livelihood in local host communities, as well as informing intervention strategies and knowledge advancement.",
              "This systematic review adhered to the guidelines and criteria set out in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement [21].",
              "A protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018114681) and has been published [22].",
              "In order to avoid replicating an already existing study on this topic, Cochrane library, Google Scholar and Scopus were searched to ensure there were no previous systematic reviews or meta-analyses on the impact of heritage tourism on sustainable community development and the health of local host communities.",
              "No such reviews or analyses were found.",
              "The search then sought to use a list of relevant text words and sub-headings of keywords and/or MeSH vocabulary according to each searched database.",

              "For example, the limitation placed on access to prime grazing land for cattle belonging to local residents was perceived to be a negative impact both ecologically and economically [60, 141].",
              "This may be considered detrimental from an environmental standpoint due to the alteration of the local ecosystem and destruction of natural resources and wildlife habitat, such as the building of infrastructure to support the development of tourist accommodation, transport, and experiences.",
              "Economically, the loss of grazing land results in reduced food sources for cattle and consequently a potential reliance on alternative food sources (which may or may not be accessible or affordable), or in the worst-case scenario death of cattle [92].",
              "In turn, this loss of cattle has an adverse impact on the financial livelihood of host communities, who may rely on their cattle as a sole or combined source of income.",
              "Considered in isolation or combination, this single negative impact of tourism\u2013reduced grazing access\u2013has flow-on effects to multiple health determinants.",
              "Therefore, it is important to consider the possible multifactorial impacts of tourism, heritage or otherwise, on the host communities involved (or at least affected) given they may have a profound and lasting impact, whether favourable or not.",
              "The potential interrelationships and multifactorial nature of heritage tourism on the health and wellbeing of host communities were also identified among a number of other studies included in this review.",
              "For example, a study from the Western Pacific Region explored connections between the analysis of tourism impacts, wellbeing of the host community and the \u2018mobilities\u2019 approach, acknowledging the three areas were different in essence but converging areas in relation to tourism sustainability [125].",
              "That said, the cross-over between social determinants was not always observed or presented as many studies primarily focused on a single health domain [43\u201351, 53, 55\u201357, 59, 61, 71, 74, 86\u201390, 103, 104, 108\u2013110, 118, 130, 134\u2013136, 138\u2013140].",
              "Some studies, for instance, focused on poverty reduction and/or alleviation [134, 135], while others focused solely on cultural sustainability or sociocultural factors [109, 110, 118], and others delved only into the ecological or environmental impacts of tourism [86, 89].",
              "As noted above, the majority of studies that focused on a single health determinant considered economic factors.",
              "A common theme that spanned multiple health domains was the threat of relocation.",
              "Here, local communities represented in the reviewed studies were often at risk of being forced to relocate from their ancestral lands for tourism and/or nature conservation purposes [41, 60, 80, 131].",
              "This risk not only threatens their way of life and livelihood from an economic perspective, but will also have social implications, jeopardising the sustainability and longevity of their cultural traditions and practices on the land to which they belong [41, 60, 80, 131].",
              "Moreover, it may have ongoing implications for the displacement of family structures and segregation of local communities.",
              "Importantly, this systematic review revealed that cultural determinants of health and wellbeing were the least explored in every region and were in many instances entirely omitted.",
              "This is at odds with the increasingly prevalent advice found in wider heritage and tourism academic debates, where it is argued that cultural institutions such as museums and their objects, for example, may contribute to health and wellbeing in the following ways: promoting relaxation;",
              "providing interventions that affect positive changes in physiology and/or emotions;",
              "supporting introspection;",
              "encouraging public health advocacy;",
              "and enhancing healthcare environments [142\u2013144].",
              "Likewise, Riordan and Schofield have considered the cultural significance of traditional medicine, citing its profound importance to the health and wellbeing of the communities who practice it as well as positioning it as a core element of both local and national economies [145].",
              "Of greater concern is the finding of this review that of the relatively small number of papers investigating cultural health determinants, many recorded profoundly negative and traumatising outcomes of tourism development, such as a rise of ethnoreligious conflict, loss of ancestral land, a dilution of cultural practices to meet tourist demands, and a loss of cultural authenticity [41].",
              "Consequently, comparative studies that focus on cultural determinants, in addition to economic and environmental determinants, are currently lacking and should therefore be prioritised in future research.",
              "In fact, only one fifth of those papers included in this review adopted the qualitative approach needed to probe the socio-cultural dimensions of health.",
              "Novel qualitative research methods to investigate community health are therefore a major research lacuna.",
              "Just as solely equating community health and wellbeing with economic flourishing is problematic, so too is assuming that health is reducible only to clinical care and disease [146], given that \"[i]deas about health .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "are cultural\u201d [146].",
              "Early indications of an acceptance that culture and heritage might be central to community health and wellbeing can be found in UNESCO\u2019s 1995 report, Our Creative Diversity: Report of the World Commission on Culture and Development [147].",
              "More recently, this notion is evidenced in the 2019 Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention [148] and the 2020 Operational Directives for UNESCO\u2019s Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage [149], both of which indicate the need for a major shift in research foci towards cultural determinants of health and wellbeing if research is to keep pace with assumptions now operating within international policy [148, 149].",
              "Although Africa, Europe and the Americas are the three regions with the highest proportion of papers investigating the economic benefits of tourism on health and wellbeing, these regions are also the most responsive to the above recommended changes in policy and debate (see Table 3).",
              "In these three regions, the proportion of outputs investigating economic health determinants since 2019 is the smallest, demonstrating a recent decline in research that is persuaded by the a priori assumption that economic wellbeing automatically equates to cultural wellbeing.",
              "Despite demonstrating the most holistic approach to understanding health and wellbeing across all the themes, an upwards trend in economy-focused research was identified in South-East Asia, since more than half of the economic outputs were produced in the last two years.",
              "Such a trend is potentially problematic for this region because it may reinforce the notion that the main benefits of tourism are direct and financial, rather than refocusing on the tension created by indirect effects of tourism on quality of life and community wellbeing.",
              "Conversely, this review demonstrates that the Western Pacific region has persisted with research focused on the economic drivers of wellbeing in relation to heritage tourism (see Table 3).",
              "This persistence may be explained by the relative lack of participation (either as researchers or stakeholders) by local communities in any of the studies included in this review (see Table 4).",
              "Indeed, the Western Pacific had the lowest occurrence of community participation and/or consultation in establishing indicators of wellbeing and health and/or opinions about the role of tourism in promoting these.",
              "On the contrary, while seemingly demonstrating the second highest proportion of exclusionary research methods as discussed above, South-East Asia remains the only region where any attempts were made to ensure community members were invited to design and co-lead research (see Table 4).",
              "Nonetheless, meaningful modes of participation in this region were found to be more closely in line with the deficits found in Africa, Europe, and the Americas.",
              "This lack of approaches aimed at including affected communities as researchers in all but one instance in South-East Asia is an important research gap in tourism studies\u2019 engagement with health and wellbeing debates.",
              "Importantly, this failure to adequately engage with affected communities is at odds with the depth of research emanating from a range of health disciplines, such as disability studies, occupational therapy, public health, and midwifery, where the slogan \u2018nothing about us without us\u2019, which emerged in the 1980s, remains prominent.",
              "Coupled with a lack of focus on cultural determinants of health, this lack of participation and community direction strongly indicates that research studies are being approached with an a priori notion about what \u2018wellbeing\u2019 means to local communities, and risks limiting the relevance and accuracy of the research that is being undertaken.",
              "Problematically, therefore, there is a tendency to envisage a \u2018package\u2019 of wellbeing and health benefits that tourism can potentially bring to a community (regardless of cultural background), with research focusing on identifying the presence or absence of elements of this assumed, overarching \u2018package\u2019.",
              "Interestingly, along with the paucity of full and meaningful collaboration with local community hosts in tourism research, there were no instances across the systematic review where a longitudinal approach was adopted.",
              "This observation reinforces the point that long-term, collaborative explorations of culturally specific concepts including such things as \u2018welfare\u2019, \u2018benefit\u2019, \u2018healthfulness\u2019 and \u2018flourishing\u2019, or combinations of these, are lacking across all regions.",
              "To bring tourism research more in line with broader debates and international policy directions about wellbeing, it is important for future research that the qualities of health and wellbeing in a particular cultural setting are investigated as a starting point, and culturally suitable approaches are designed (with local researchers) to best examine the effects of tourism on these contingent notions of wellbeing.",
              "Importantly, a lack of longitudinal research will lead to a gap in our understanding about whether the negative impacts of tourism increase or compound over time.",
              "Adopting these ethnographies of health and wellbeing hinges upon long-term community partnerships that will serve to redress a research gap into the longevity of heritage tourism impacts.",
              "Furthermore, of those papers that asked local community members about their perceptions of heritage tourism across all regions, a common finding was the desire for greater decision-making and management of the enterprises as stakeholders.",
              "It seems ironic, therefore, that research into heritage tourism perceptions itself commonly invites the bare minimum of collaboration to establish the parameters of that research.",
              "In a small number of papers that invited community opinions, local stakeholders considered that the tourism \u2018benefits package\u2019 myth should be dispelled, and that responsible tourism development should only happen as part of a wider suite of livelihood options, such as agriculture, so that economic diversity is maintained.",
              "Such a multi-livelihood framework would also promote the accessibility of benefits for more of the community, and this poses a significant new direction for tourism research.",
              "For example, an outcome of the review was the observation that infrastructure development is often directed towards privileged tourism livelihood options [150], but a more holistic framework would distribute these sorts of benefits to also co-develop other livelihoods.",
              "Although there is a clear interest in understanding the relationship between heritage, tourism, health and wellbeing, future research that explores the intersections of heritage tourism with multiple health domains, in particular social and cultural domains, is critical.",
              "Indeed, the frequency with which the negative impacts of heritage tourism were reported in the small number of studies that engaged local community participants suggests that studies co-designed with community participants are a necessary future direction in order for academics, policymakers and professionals working in the field of heritage tourism to more adequately address the scarce knowledge about its socio-cultural impacts.",
              "The accepted importance of community researchers in cognate fields underscores that the knowledge, presence and skills of affected communities are vital and points to the need for similar studies in heritage tourism.",
              "There are five main findings of this systematic review, each of which is a critical gap in research that should be addressed to support the health and wellbeing in local communities at tourism destinations.",
              "Firstly, whilst one of the primary findings of this systematic review was the increase in employment opportunities resulting from tourism, this disclosure arose because of a strong\u2013in many cases, exclusive\u2013methodological focus on economic indicators of health and wellbeing.",
              "Such research reveals that heritage tourism may significantly reduce poverty and may be used as a poverty-reducing strategy in low-income countries.",
              "However, the assumption underlying this focus on the economic benefits of tourism for health and wellbeing is that economic benefits are a proxy for other determinants of health, e.",
              "g., cultural, social, environmental, etc.",
              ", which are otherwise less systematically explored.",
              "In particular, the ways in which combinations of environmental, social, cultural, and economic determinants on wellbeing interact is an area requires considerable future research.",
              "Secondly, whilst economic drivers of wellbeing were the most common area of research across all regions, the impacts of tourism on cultural wellbeing were the least explored.",
              "Moreover, in many publications culture was entirely omitted.",
              "This is perhaps one of the most troubling outcomes of this systematic review, because in the relatively small number of papers that did investigate the cultural impacts of tourism, many reported traumatising consequences for local communities, the documentation of which would not be recorded in the majority of papers where cultural wellbeing was absent.",
              "Tourism\u2019s profoundly damaging consequences included reports of a rise in ethnoreligious violence, loss of ancestral land and the threat of forced relocation, not to mentioned extensive reports of cultural atrophy.",
              "Linked to this lack of understanding about the cultural impacts of tourism on wellbeing, the third finding of this review is that there are far fewer studies that incorporate qualitative data, more suited to document intangible cultural changes, whether positive or negative.",
              "Furthermore, more longitudinal research is also needed to address the subtle impacts of tourism acting over longer timescales.",
              "The systematic review revealed a lack of understanding about how both the negative and positive outcomes of heritage tourism change over time, whether by increasing, ameliorating, or compounding.",
              "The fourth finding of this research is that, to a degree and in certain regions of the world, research is responding to international policy.",
              "This review has illustrated that, historically, Africa, Europe and the Americas prioritised research that measured the economic effects of tourism on health and wellbeing.",
              "However, after 2019 a shift occurred towards a growing but still under-represented interest in social-cultural wellbeing.",
              "We propose that this shift aligns with recommendations from UNESCO\u2019s 2019 Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention [148] and the 2020 Operational Directives for UNESCO\u2019s Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage [149].",
              "The exception to this shift is the Western Pacific region, where the economic impacts of tourism are increasingly prioritised as the main indicator of wellbeing.",
              "Given the overall efficacy of policy for steering towards ethical and culturally-grounded evaluations of the impacts of tourism, we would urge heritage policymakers to take account of our recommendations (Table 2).",
              "The policy implications emerging from this review are the fifth finding and can be distilled into a few key propositions.",
              "There is a need for meaningful decolonising approaches to heritage tourism.",
              "More than half of the negative consequences of heritage tourism for health and wellbeing could be mitigated with policy guidance, contingent cultural protocols and anti-colonial methods that foreground the rights of local (including Indigenous) communities to design, govern, lead, and establish the terms of tourism in their local area.",
              "Although \u2018participation\u2019 has become a popular term that invokes an idea of power symmetries in tourism enterprises, it is clear from this systematic review that the term leaves too much latitude for the creep of poor-practice [151] that ultimately erodes community autonomy and self-determination.",
              "Participation is not enough if it means that there is scope for governments and foreign investors to superficially engage with community wellbeing needs and concerns.",
              "Furthermore, calls for \u2018capacity-building\u2019 that effectively re-engineer the knowledges of local communities are fundamentally problematic because they presuppose a missing competency or knowledge.",
              "This is at odds with impassioned anti-colonial advocacy [152] which recognises that communities hold a range of knowledges and cultural assets that they may, and should be legally protected to, deploy (or not) as a culturally-suitable foundation that steers the design of locally-governed tourism enterprises.",
              "In short, to maximise and extend the benefits of heritage tourism and address major social determinants of health, host communities\u2019 presence in heritage tourism governance, decision making processes, and control of and access to the resultant community resources and programs must be a priority.",
              "Future policymakers are encouraged to make guidance more explicit, enforceable and provision avenues for feedback from local communities that offers the protections of transparency.",
              "It is also imperative that researchers involve and empower local community groups as part of studies conducted in relation to their health and wellbeing.",
              "If current practices remain unchanged, the primary benefit of tourism could easily be rendered inaccessible through lack of education and/or appropriate training which was frequently identified as a barrier to community participation.",

              "Three types of community participation can be identified in the context of tourism development and heritage management: coercive participation, induced participation, and spontaneous participation [13\u201317].",
              "Coercive community participation refers to the lowest level of participation in which residents have no power over the course of the tourism development.",
              "Their involvement is limited to various predefined activities revolving around tourism destination promotion and they receive few economic benefits [16].",
              "In induced community participation, although local residents have a say in the heritage management and tourism development process, they have no actual power or control over the decisions being made by those in positions of authority [16,18].",
              "In spontaneous participation, local residents have the power to make decisions and control the development process [16,17].",
              "Notwithstanding, the involvement of local communities in WHS conservation and tourism development is contingent upon a variety of factors that may either facilitate or hinder their involvement.",
              "Local communities must be aware of the value of the WHS in which they inhabit and have the necessary knowledge and skills with which to take advantage of tourism development and conservation opportunities.",

              "We conclude this paper by outlining the theoretical and practical implications of this study and offer a number of recommendations for future research.",
              "This paper uses content analysis to review the current community participation literature with respect to rural WHSs.",
              "To be more exact, we reviewed books and scholarly articles published in refereed tourism journals identified using Google Scholar from 1990 until late 2015.",
              "Content analysis is a research method used to trace the evolution of a phenomenon over an extended period and can reveal a wealth of related knowledge [21,22].",
              "We searched Google Scholar for scholarly articles using three groups of keyword searches.",
              "In search Group 1, we searched for \u201ccommunity participation,\u201d \u201ccommunity involvement,\u201d \u201ccommunity engagement,\u201d \u201cresident participation,\u201d \u201cresident involvement,\u201d \u201cresident engagement,\u201d and \u201cpublic participation.",

              "\u201d We narrowed our search by combining these three keyword groups.",
              "We finalised our list of articles by including at least a keyword from Group 1 and another keyword from either Group 2 or 3.",
              "Using this method of selecting the articles, we identified approximately 60 literary sources for analysis.",
              "Each article was reviewed and analysed to identify (a) the concept of community participation in tourism destinations, particularly rural WHSs;",
              "(b) the various types of community participation and what was most prevalent in rural WHSs;",
              "and (c) the factors influencing the successful community participation of residents in rural WHSs.",
              "Using this approach, we elucidated a number of recommendations for rural WHS authorities looking to successfully involve local communities in sustainable WHS conservation and tourism development.",
              "As previously noted, community participation constitutes a relationship established by the members of the community themselves through their mutual collaboration in working toward achieving common goals and making their community a better place in which to live [2].",
              "Community involvement, therefore, is a process of working together with people in the community for the benefit of the said community.",
              "In such an arrangement, the connections and interactions between community members are important for creating strong bonds and relationships.",
              "Consequently, community involvement can create a sense of belonging, trust, and credibility among community members [6,23].",
              "Numerous studies attest to the importance of community participation in the conservation and tourism development of heritage sites [6\u20139,24].",
              "Community participation in WHS management can address conflicts between the economic and developmental interests of the community and the need to conserve the WHS destination as a precious resource and can assist in clarifying the concept of heritage among community members [3,8].",
              "Several heritage management studies have confirmed the importance of public participation in sustainable conservation programmes [7,10].",
              "The local community\u2019s participation in heritage management contributes toward an improved quality of life, economic development, and the sustainability of conservation programmes [3,6,7].",
              "Moreover, community participation can instil a sense of pride in the community.",
              "According to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the declaration of a site as a WHS forms part of an overall strategy aimed at recognising and protecting the site [25].",
              "As such, the accumulated local knowledge and sense of belonging to a certain place should ideally help the community to live in harmony with the value associated with the site.",
              "Educating local communities about their histories, however, is a vital prerequisite for communities to familiarise themselves with their heritage and for them to feel a sense of pride for their site and historical relics.",
              "Community participation is vital to this pride-instilling process.",
              "Community involvement in heritage projects can influence residents\u2019 sense of belonging, aid in the development of social networks with others, and improve residents\u2019 pride and understanding of the value of the local area [7,9,11,12,24].",
              "Notwithstanding, WHSs and tourism development are characterised by symbioses and tension [8].",
              "The inscription of a site as a WHS enhances the international visibility of the site, thus serving to attract tourism development, which in turn has the potential public and financial support for the conservation of the heritage site [8,26].",
              "Nonetheless, it is important to develop the site and its surrounding area as a tourist destination for the economic development of local communities while, at the same time, prioritising sustainable conservation programmes within the area to maintain the site itself [27].",
              "Therefore, community participation in the context of WHS conservation programmes and tourism development is significant and meaningful.",
              "Community participation strengthens communities because it involves making connections between individuals within the community, with these relationships helping to create a sense of belonging, trust, and credibility [3,6].",
              "Moreover, in the context of WHS conservation and tourism development, community participation is an empowering process involving all tiers of stakeholders (i.",
              "e., local government, local residents, and private enterprise), such that problem identification and decision-making are shared and stakeholders have a collective interest in the sustainability of the development [6,28\u201333].",
              "Both the community and the tourism developers alike benefit from their involvement in this process, boosting their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community [30,32,34\u201336]).",
              "Destination communities, due to their historical knowledge of how the community adapts to change and being the group most affected by tourism, should be actively involved in tourism planning, especially given the expectation that they will become an integral part of the tourism product [30,37].",
              "Furthermore, some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided, and positive impacts maximised, through community participation in the planning process.",
              "Community participation in the context of tourism planning focuses on the decision-making process and the benefits of tourism development [29,32,33].",
              "The involvement of the local community in the decision-making process benefits the local economy and boosts residents\u2019 respect for their traditional lifestyle and values [32,34\u201336].",
              "Local residents can benefit economically, either through employment with introduced businesses or by establishing their own small businesses to generate additional economic benefits for their community [33].",
              "Local community participation provides residents with a range of opportunities to participate effectively in tourism development activities, to mobilise their capacities as social actors rather than as passive subjects, to make decisions, and to control the activities that affect their lives.",
              "The participation of the local community in tourism is a driving force for change and a catalyst for development.",
              "According to Telfer and Sharpley [38], local communities can provide a wide range of perspectives on tourism development.",
              "Inskeep [39] argued that only through their involvement in tourism activities can local communities maximise the socioeconomic benefits from tourism.",
              "Moreover, the accuracy of representations of their traditional lifestyles and values is contingent upon the involvement of the local community in the planning and development process [36].",
              "Therefore, sustainable tourism development relies upon the involvement of the local community.",
              "Notwithstanding, this literature has revealed various streams of community involvement and participation, which should be elucidated to understand this concept better in the context of rural WHSs.",
              "Several researchers have identified various types of community participation, from manipulative participation to citizen power [13\u201316].",
              "Arnstein [13], a pioneer in this area, suggested an eight-tier hierarchy of resident participation categorised according to three groups: manipulative participation, citizen tokenism, and citizen power [18].",
              "Pretty [14] developed a somewhat similar typology of community participation inclusive of three categories: manipulative participation, passive participation, and self-mobilisation [15,17].",
              "Tosun [16,18] applied the typologies of Arnstein [13] and Pretty [14] to tourism to identify the three forms of community participation already explained: coercive participation, induced participation, and spontaneous participation [17].",
              "Note, however, that, in coercive community participation, residents\u2019 involvement is limited to predefined activities in accordance with decisions made by power-holders who also determine how residents will act to promote the destination and to what economic benefits they will be entitled.",
              "The residents themselves, however, have no actual power or opportunities to make their voices heard [16].",
              "The second form of community participation, based on Tosun\u2019s typology, is induced community participation, which is similar to citizen tokenism in Arnstein\u2019s model and consultation in Petty\u2019s typology [16].",
              "In induced community participation, although residents\u2019 have a voice in the tourism development process, they lack the power with which to control the decision-making processes [16,18].",
              "In short, power-holders determine whether the opinions of residents will be accepted or rejected and how they will impact the planning and development process [17].",
              "This type of participation often takes the form of public hearings and usually occurs late in the development planning process, once most issues have already been resolved and decisions have been made [40].",
              "The highest level of community participation is spontaneous participation in Tosun\u2019s model, citizen power in Arnstein\u2019s typology, and self-mobilisation and interactive participation in Petty\u2019s study.",
              "As observed previously, spontaneous participation refers to the power of residents to make decisions and control the process of development [16].",
              "Spontaneous participation can generate trust, ownership, and social capital among the residents [23,41].",
              "However, several studies have found that destination communities in the developing world, or in less developed areas, such as rural destinations, prefer minimal levels of community participation and economic involvement [19,20,33].",
              "Residents in these locations tend to be less interested in participating in decision-making or controlling the process of tourism development and heritage conservation [19,20,33].",
              "In some less developed destinations, residents indicated a preference for involvement of economic activities and benefit sharing over involvement in the decision-making processes [19].",
              "We speculate that such findings are the product of the economic importance of tourism to rural communities.",
              "Tourism in rural WHS destinations has historically been an important mechanism for development.",
              "Consequently, rural destination communities aspire to become involved in tourism activities, if only so that they might receive a significant share of the economic benefits in the form of direct revenue, employment, infrastructure, and housing ownership [42].",
              "Of course, the involvement of local communities benefits tourists as well, as the local community is ideally poised to provide tourists with a range of accommodation, information, transport, and other facilities and services [43].",
              "Secondary to these economic benefits, tourism helps to improve the local community\u2019s quality of life [44].",
              "A study of tourism in a mountainous area reported that local community involvement played an important role in the development and conservation of the environment and other resources and in marketing the destination [45].",
              "Residents\u2019 community participation preferences are contingent upon a number of factors [6,11].",
              "Having investigated the factors influencing residents\u2019 community participation preferences in heritage management and tourism development, three categories of influencing factors become apparent: motivation, opportunity, and ability [46,47].",
              "Motivation concerns residents\u2019 willingness and interest to become involved in the development/management process [48,49].",
              "In the context of WHS destinations, motivation affects residents\u2019 perceptions, WHS inscription, and subsequent tourism development impacts.",
              "Focusing on the perceived positive impacts of tourism encourages the community to participate in tourism activities and heritage conservation programmes and to support tourism development, whereas focusing on the perceived negative effects reduces their support for tourism development [6,7,11].",
              "Therefore, community participation in WHS conservation programmes and tourism development processes depends on the concerns, interests, and perceptions of residents regarding the impacts of tourism development [6,7,11,46,47].",
              "Bearing this in mind, the inscription of a destination as a WHS and development of tourism can positively influence the lives of local residents, with increased income, employment opportunities, improved standards of living, improved public infrastructure, increased availability of recreational and entertainment facilities, and the promotion and preservation of local culture [50\u201356].",
              "However, tourism also has the potential to negatively impact local communities by increasing the cost of living, raising property prices, overcrowding and traffic congestion, and increasing the prevalence of crime and drugs [9,50,52,53,57,58].",
              "Several studies have highlighted the significant effect of destination residents\u2019 perceptions of WHS inscription and tourism development on community involvement [6,11,46,47,59].",
              "These studies suggest that residents who perceive the positive impacts of WHS inscription and tourism development to outweigh the negatives are more eager to participate in WHS conservation programmes and tourism development.",
              "However, for most residents of rural destinations, this interest in participation is limited to engaging in predefined activities, with power-holders enabled to make decisions on the behalf of the community with respect to how the destination will be promoted and what economic opportunities will be available for the local community [9,16,26,30].",
              "These studies suggest that residents in WHS destination communities tend not to be interested in participating in the decision-making processes.",
              "The aforementioned opportunities refer to preconditions, such as the political will, rules, and channels that make possible the participation of residents in tourism activities and conservation programmes [46].",
              "These opportunities, therefore, are a reflection of the extent to which current circumstances are conductive to community participation [49].",
              "Without open channels of communication between community members and correspondence organisations, community participation in conservation programmes and tourism development is impossible [26].",
              "Therefore, the extent to which local political structures allow for and facilitate the participation of community members constrains the participation of local residents [26,33,46].",
              "In most developing countries, political structures are centralised and top-down, with political parties and decision-makers unlikely to share power with the public.",
              "In such an environment, spontaneous community participation may be difficult, if not impossible, hence the propensity toward coercive community participation and public hearings in developing countries [16,26,30].",
              "If local residents assume that authorities and government officials are interested in hearing their voices and will provide them with opportunities to become involved in the decision-making process, they will be encouraged to participate.",
              "Ultimately, residents will participate in conservation programmes and tourism development to the extent to which they believe that local authorities will allow [26,33,46].",
              "However, in underdeveloped and rural destinations, particularly in the developing world, residents assume that the centralised political structure and the tendency of local decision-makers to shun power sharing will work against them [16,26,30].",
              "As such, participating in the decision-making process is often a completely alien concept for many rural residents in developing countries;",
              "consequently, their first preference is simply to undertake economic activities.",
              "Moreover, the ability of the community to participate in conservation programmes and tourism development is contingent upon various factors, including knowledge, skills, and financial resources [46].",
              "Several studies have identified a lack of knowledge among residents as an obstacle to their participation, particularly in rural destinations [30,60\u201362].",
              "Community participation requires, in one form or another, a certain level of skill and knowledge, and community members must be prepared to improve these skills to participate effectively.",
              "To address this issue, Tosun and Timothy [62] suggested public media campaigns to train and educate people, thereby improving their awareness and readiness for involvement in tourism development.",
              "Notwithstanding, most tourism-related jobs do not require a particularly high level of skill or specialised knowledge [63].",
              "As such, rural residents can easily transition into tourism-related economic activities with minimal investment in education and upskilling.",
              "For example, rural residents can often easily establish themselves as accommodation providers, operate restaurants, and provide recreational/entertainment activities.",
              "This study reviews and synthesises the community participation literature related to rural WHS destinations.",
              "Community participation plays a significant role in reviving and sustaining the status of WHSs, leading to economic development and subsequent improvements in the quality of life of local communities [3,7,63].",
              "However, in the context of tourism planning, the community participation literature revealed varying levels of community involvement, ranging from participation in decision-making to involvement in economic activities [29,32,33].",
              "The findings of the current study reveal that the residents of rural destinations prefer to limit their involvement to economic activities to participation in the decision-making processes [19,20,33].",
              "The inscription of a site as a WHS enhances the location\u2019s international visibility, thus serving as a magnet for tourism development and the economic development of local communities [8,26].",
              "The support of local residents in conservations programmes, therefore, is important in terms of maintaining the site\u2019s WHS status to attract more tourists and increase the range of benefits available to the local community through their continued economic involvement.",
              "In addition, the findings in relation to the factors influencing community participation reveal the importance of ability (as a function of awareness and knowledge) and motivation (as related to perceptions and interest) in compelling rural residents toward involvement in economic activities compared to participating in the executive-level decision-making.",
              "Moreover, in rural WHSs, particularly in developing countries, the political structure often restricts the participation of community residents to planned economic activities and heritage site promotion, throwing up barriers to their involvement in the decision-making processes [16,26,30].",
              "Therefore, economic involvement is the preferred type of community participation in rural WHS communities, particularly in the developing world.",
              "These findings mark a significant theoretical contribution of the present study to the community participation literature.",
              "Notwithstanding, this study is also limited by the fact that only existing literature was reviewed to shed light on community participation in the rural WHS context.",
              "Case-base rural WHS studies, in developed and developing countries, would go a long way toward clarifying some of the issues identified in the present study.",
              "This study has a number of practical implications for local authorities and correspondence organisations responsible for the management and development of rural WHS destinations.",
              "To sustain the development of rural WHS destinations, the local authorities should aim to facilitate the participation of the community.",
              "The participation of local residents in WHS conservation and tourism development is critical to future sustainable development.",
              "However, based on the results of this review, local authorities should focus on the economic involvement of residents and look to maximise the residents\u2019 benefits from tourism to attract further support among the local community for conservation programmes and tourism development.",
              "Local authorities should undertake to improve residents\u2019 awareness, knowledge, and skills with respect to tourism development, conservation, and the importance of maintaining the WHS status.",
              "Such activities would facilitate the effective involvement of local residents.",
              "Moreover, by enhancing the positive impacts and mitigating the negative impacts of tourism, local authorities can increase community members\u2019 motivation to become involved.",
              "Enhancing the perceived positive impact of tourism encourages the community to participate in tourism activities and heritage conservation programmes, whereas the perception of negative effects reduces local residents\u2019 participation and support for tourism development.",
              "Increasing the number of opportunities for the local community to become involved will entail a review of existing policies, rules, and regulations to ensure the removal of barriers to community participation, employing a more transparent and egalitarian political structure and maximising the capacity of communication channels.",
              "Local residents will involve themselves in conservation programmes and tourism development only to the extent to why they believe that local authorities and government officials will allow;",
              "therefore, maximising what is allowed will invariably benefit plans for gaining the most out of community involvement.",

              "At Solimar, we value tourism for the economic and social development that it brings to communities all over the world.",
              "Protecting cultural heritage is one of our utmost priorities as well as a core development objective in all of our projects.",
              "When done right, building a strong tourism economy is a great way for local residents of any region to nurture their own cultural heritage and also provide meaningful educational experiences to visitors.",
              "Today\u2019s travelers are looking for more than just pretty views and fancy dinners;",
              "they want the authenticity that comes from diving into an entirely new culture.",
              "From rural communities in Armenia to World Heritage Sites in Portugal, learn more about how tourism can protect cultural heritage.",
              "One of the most impactful ways that tourism can protect cultural heritage is through community empowerment.",
              "This occurs when tourists are educated about the history and traditions of the local community, and in turn that community feels a stronger cohesion and sense of pride in that cultural history.",
              "Additionally, tourism based around cultural assets encourages locals to continue to pass on traditions and practices that are embedded in their history.",
              "The process of teaching other community members about these traditional methods creates a sense of unity through history.",
              "The feeling of community allyship is strengthened when tourists visit a place specifically to experience the culture.",
              "Having people from all over the world know about the importance of a community\u2019s history and cultural heritage is something to be proud of, and community members will embrace their heritage more and more as that pride grows and spreads.",
              "In Atauro (a small island in Timor-Leste), tourists are encouraged to visit the local arts and crafts markets.",
              "Rising popularity of the markets encourages locals to continue crafting and creating goods that reflect their culture.",
              "When tourists appreciate local markets such as these, it sparks pride in the community and allows them to continue doing work that is culturally significant.",
              "In order for this to occur, Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) and local governments must ensure that community stakeholders are present and involved in tourism development.",
              "When looking at tourism as a tool to protect and inform cultural heritage, it can also be seen as a teaching tool.",
              "Tourism can be viewed as a process: money is exchanged, parts of a community are engaged through a tourist\u2019s stay, and the tourist walks away with memories and feelings for the location.",
              "However, when the tourist is engaged with an itinerary that focuses on heritage tourism, the takeaways or \u201cpost-visit behaviors\u201d are likely to be more significant.",
              "This is for two main reasons: 1) Someone who seeks out cultural heritage tourism is more likely to be motivated to learn something on their trip.",
              "(Check out this awesome study by Indonesia University of Education to learn more about what their study revealed) and 2) The nature of cultural heritage tourism allows for an extra layer of a destination to be revealed.",
              "For example, let\u2019s say a tourist visits a beach to watch the sunset at a particular destination.",
              "They walk away with an impression of the beauty of the location.",
              "What if it was framed through cultural heritage?",
              "Instead of just watching the sunset, the tourist gets to watch the sunset while engaging in a traditional feast that honors the island and all that it gives and includes a local folktale of what the sunset means to local culture.",
              "Now, that sunset experience has more significance for the tourist whose motivations resided in seeking knowledge.",
              "A large part of tourism is the intentions that motivate tourist behavior, and engaging with cultural heritage tourism allows a tourist to expand their horizons and connect more deeply with the people and the destination.",
              "The universal recognition and classification for the world heritage sites were adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1972, originated in an international treaty called the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.",
              "Their mission is to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of the valuable cultural and natural heritage sites to humanity around the world, regardless of the boundary limitations.",
              "To help site managers, national/local authorities, local/international tourism industry, or even visitors and residents fully understand the essence of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites and sustainable tourism, a toolkit is provided by the UNESCO with the holistic guideline for managing heritage sites in destinations.",
              "Step by step guidance from understanding, strategic planning, governance to stakeholder engagement are available on the website with real case studies are available on the website.",
              "Building on this work, Solimar recently launched its World Heritage Journeys of the Silk Road, a 10-week virtual training program for tourism and cultural heritage authorities in Central Asia.",
              "This program builds on the results from the sustainable tourism planning and management capacity building workshop that brought together tourism stakeholders from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.",
              "The workshop introduced participants to UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage and Sustainable Tourism Programme and the tools necessary to conserve cultural and natural heritage of Outstanding Universal Value.",
              "This Virtual Training program will build on these learnings by reuniting World Heritage and tourism authorities from the participating countries to work together to learn how to better manage sustainable tourism, how to recover and prepare for the return of tourism in the era of COVID-19, and to develop a series of cross-border itineraries that are hosted on UNESCO sustainable tourism platform \u2013 World Heritage Journeys.",
              "As a specialist consulting and marketing firm in sustainable tourism, it is always our mission to ensure that sustainability underlies everything we do.",
              "We must work to ensure that the cultural and natural resources are protected in the development process, which leads to the long-term success for destinations.",
              "By building a sustainable tourism environment, empowering local communities, and preserving cultural values and heritage boosts the understanding and collaboration between stakeholders in different sectors.",
              "Working with local communities, we can help more destinations realize how tourism can protect cultural heritage and cherish our shared history of place.",

              "Posted in Blog.",
              "Picture this: cultural education and interpretation that breathe life into traditions, a vibrant marketplace brimming with authentic cultural treasures, the rallying cry of policy advocacy and representation, and the gentle footprints of ecotourism echoing through ancestral lands.",
              "Indigenous communities showcase some of the world\u2019s richest and uniquely diverse cultures, a stark departure from the Eurocentric norms many people are accustomed to.",
              "This captivating contrast is driving the surge in cultural tourism, propelling it as one of the fastest-growing segments in the industry.",
              "Within this realm, travelers seek encounters with gastronomy, heritage, religious sites, craftsmanship, and festivals, all offering a captivating lens through which to view the world.",
              "Similarly, according to a report by the TICAA Consortium, Indigenous communities around the world conserve around 22% of the biodiversity of the Earth and around 21% of the global land.",
              "This represents a more significant percentage than the land and biodiversity conserved by States, including federal lands and national parks.",
              "Several scholars agree that the traditional knowledge of Indigenous Peoples is valuable for land and resource conservation.",
              "Thus, their involvement in development programs, including tourism development programs, is essential.",
              "Tourism can stimulate economies, promote infrastructure development, and protect natural and cultural resources.",
              "However, it\u2019s crucial to recognize its impact on Indigenous communities and the need for cultural connection.",
              "The reckless commodification of cultural assets alienates Indigenous communities, perpetuates cultural exploitation, and endangers biodiversity.",
              "Indigenous Involvement in the decision-making processes of tourism development and policy formulation is essential to ensure that the magic of cultural tourism benefits everyone involved, preserving authenticity and fostering mutual understanding.",
              "Indigenous tourism, a form of cultural exchange celebrating Indigenous cultures, relies on the active involvement of Indigenous communities.",
              "This involves cultural tours, homestays, art exhibitions, storytelling, and traditional activities.",
              "Examples of these include the Canadian coastal adventures curated by Abegweit Mi\u2019kmaq Nation, the hiking tourism trail led by the Raramuris in Mexico, and the Daintree Rainforest experiences organized and executed by Kuku Yalanji people of Australia.",
              "When done correctly, Indigenous tourism goes beyond low-skill labor and contributes to the well-being and empowerment of Indigenous peoples.",
              "However, an example of how easily governments can exploit cultural assets without actively involving Indigenous Peoples is the use of prehispanic cultural heritage in the Maya area of Mexico where the federal government has approved the construction of several infrastructure projects such as Xcaret, offering the ancient Maya culture as an attraction (essentially, cultural appropriation), and where contemporary Maya people are usually only employed as low-skill labor.",
              "By reevaluating actions, utilizing international legal frameworks, and stepping back from a critical perspective, significant improvements can be made.",
              "For centuries, Indigenous communities have been participating in tourism.",
              "Initially, visitors commodified them for pleasure, but as awareness grew, they began exhibiting their artifacts and traditions.",
              "This phase led to the realization that preserving culture was crucial, but actions toward preservation often happened outside the communities.",
              "Today, Indigenous communities actively engage in tourism, sharing their culture and traditions with visitors, asserting control over their cultural and natural resources, and taking the reins of their own narratives.",
              "International law, such as the International Labor Organization Convention No.",
              "169 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, recognizes and protects the rights of Indigenous peoples, including self-determination, cultural preservation, and involvement in land and resource decisions.",
              "These frameworks promote equality, justice, and respect for diverse cultures, and they have been the starting point of the involvement of Indigenous People in tourism development programs as agents rather than as elements of observation.",
              "In practice, challenges and conflicts may arise when balancing economic development with the rights and well-being of indigenous communities.",
              "Tourism development requires collaboration between governments, businesses, and civil society organizations to respect indigenous communities\u2019 rights and ensure meaningful benefits.",
              "We can acknowledge Indigenous communities\u2019 autonomy by empowering them economically, socially, politically, and psychologically while recognizing their historical oppression.",
              "Thoughtfully planned and community-led tourism development can help achieve this change: Economic empowerment: Tourism, including guided tours, homestays, artisan crafts, and local food, can provide Indigenous populations with a sustainable revenue source.",
              "It can also diversify sources of income, minimize reliance on a particular business, and generate employment opportunities within the community Social empowerment: Tourism can help keep Indigenous customs and cultures alive.",
              "Communities are inspired to uphold their cultural heritage when tourists actively engage with them.",
              "Similarly, as Indigenous communities collaborate to promote their culture and oversee tourism-related activities, tourism can help them feel more united.",
              "Political empowerment: Indigenous groups have greater influence in discussions on land rights and tourism development, given their rights to their ancestral lands and resources.",
              "This ensures federal governments consider their opinions in the policy-making processes.",
              "Psychological empowerment: As Indigenous tribes share and are recognized for their distinctive traditions, tourism can increase cultural pride within those communities.",
              "When communities take control of their tourism projects, their sense of identity, purpose, value, and self-esteem can be strengthened.",
              "This empowerment is also linked to the conservation of cultural and natural resources.",
              "Indigenous tourism serves as a means to preserve and revitalize cultures by providing a platform for the transmission of traditional knowledge and practices to future generations.",
              "This can foster cross-cultural understanding, environmental stewardship, and the promotion of responsible tourism.",
              "Several means can achieve these measures, but the United Nations World Tourism Organization offers recommendations that should be considered: The active involvement of indigenous peoples in tourism development not only enriches the visitor experience but also serves as a powerful means to showcase their abundant cultural heritage and profound wisdom.",
              "Indigenous communities, through their traditional ecological knowledge, can also play a crucial role in environmental conservation.",
              "Integrating indigenous perspectives into tourism planning can balance economic development with environmental preservation, prioritizing nature-based experiences and incentivizing indigenous communities to protect their natural resources.",
              "In this sense, circular tourism, characterized by reducing waste, conserving resources, and engaging local communities, is a great collaborative approach.",
              "This is a great first step towards creating more responsible tourism practices aimed at cultural and environmental conservation.",
              "Indigenous voices provide novel viewpoints, ground-breaking concepts, and revolutionary programs. Any tourism development program worth its salt must consider Indigenous communities\u2019 rich cosmologies and respect their roles as valued partners in the preservation of both culture and nature.",
              "They have long fought for their due status as caretakers of their cultural and natural heritage, and are the beating heart of a more inclusive and sustainable future for the tourism industry \u2013 a beautiful dance between tradition and progress.",

              "By Elie Dolgin A long history of mercantile trade along the eastern shores of Africa left its mark on the DNA of ancient Swahili people.",
              "A new analysis of centuries-old bones and teeth collected from six burial sites across coastal Kenya and Tanzania has found that, around 1,000 years ago, local African women began having children with Persian traders \u2014 and that the descendants of these unions gained power and status in the highest levels of pre-colonial Swahili society.",
              "The findings help elucidate the foundations of Swahili civilization, and suggest that long-told origin stories, passed down through generations of Swahili families, may be more truthful than many outsiders have presumed.",
              "\u201cThe genetics corroborate the Swahili people\u2019s own history that they tell about themselves, not what others were saying about them,\u201d said Esther Brielle, a geneticist and postdoctoral fellow at Harvard who led the DNA analysis with her adviser, David Reich.",
              "The researchers published their findings on Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
              "The Swahili Coast is a narrow strip of land that stretches some 2,000 miles along the Eastern African seaboard \u2014 from modern-day Mozambique, Comoros and Madagascar in the south, to Somalia in the north.",
              "In its medieval heyday, the region was home to hundreds of port towns, each ruled independently, but with a common religion (Islam), language (Kiswahili) and culture.",
              "Many towns grew immensely wealthy thanks to a vibrant trading network with merchants who sailed across the Indian Ocean on the monsoon winds.",
              "Middle Eastern pottery, Asian cloths\u200c\u200c and other luxury goods came in.",
              "African gold, ivory and timber\u200c\u200c went out \u2014 along with a steady flow of enslaved people, who were shipped off and sold across the Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf.",
              "(Slave trading later took place between the Swahili coast and Europe as well.)",
              "A unique cosmopolitan society emerged that blended African customs and beliefs with those of the foreign traders, some of whom stuck around and assimilated.",
              "Islam, for example, arrived from the Middle East and became an integral part of the Swahili social fabric, but with coral-stone mosques built and decorated in a local, East African style.",
              "Or consider the Kiswahili language, which is Bantu in origin but borrows heavily from Indian and Middle Eastern tongues.",
              "The arrival of Europeans, beginning around 1500, followed by Omani sailors some 200 years later, changed the character of the region.",
              "Yet, aspects of the heritage and traditions that took root in the Middle Ages remain evident in East Africa today.",
              "Researchers who have studied the region have long debated where those influences came from.",
              "At first, most scholars thought that the civilization, with its lavish mosques and ornate housewares, must have been the achievement of a foreign ruling class that established outposts in East Africa.",
              "But over the past 40 years, archaeologists, linguists and historians have come to see Swahili society as predominantly homegrown \u2014 with outside elements adopted over time that had only a marginal impact.",
              "That African-centric version of Swahili roots never sat well with the Swahili people themselves, though.",
              "They generally preferred their own origin story, one in which princes from present-day Iran (then known as Persia) sailed across the Indian Ocean, married local women and enmeshed themselves into East African society.",
              "Depending on the narrative source, that story dates to around 850 or 1000 \u2014 the same period during which genetic mixing was underway, according to the DNA analysis.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s remarkably spot on,\u201d said Mark Horton, an archaeologist at the Royal Agricultural University of England who has worked on the Swahili coast for decades.",
              "\u201cThis oral tradition was always maligned,\u201d added George Abungu, an archaeologist and former director-general of the National Museums of Kenya (who, like Dr.",
              "Horton, was not involved in the genetic analysis).",
              "\u201cNow, with this DNA study, we see there was some truth to it.",
              "\u201d The ancient DNA study is the largest of its kind from Africa, involving 135 skeletons dating to late-medieval and early-modern times, 80 of which have yielded analyzable DNA.",
              "To figure out where these people came from, the researchers compared genetic signatures from the dug-up bones with cheek swabs or saliva samples taken from modern-day individuals living in Africa, the Middle East and around the world.",
              "The burial-site DNA traced back to two primary sources: Africans and present-day Iranians.",
              "Smaller contributions came from South Asians and Arabs as well, with foreign DNA representing about half of the skeletons\u2019 genealogy.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s surprising that the genetic signature is so strong,\u201d said Jeffrey Fleisher, an archaeologist at Rice University who helped excavate the Tanzanian sites included in the analysis.",
              "He had predicted that the genetic influence from outside of Africa would be much smaller, he said.",
              "Different patterns of inheritance for different stretches of DNA have revealed how the genetic mixing came about.",
              "Gene sequences from tiny power factories inside the cell, known as mitochondria, were overwhelmingly African in origin.",
              "Since children inherit these bits of DNA only from their mothers, the researchers inferred that the maternal forbearers of the Swahili people were mostly of African descent.",
              "By comparison, the Y chromosome, passed from father to son, was chock-full of Asian DNA that the researchers found was common in modern-day Iran.",
              "So, a large fraction of Swahili ancestry presumably came from Persian men.",
              "The picture that emerges is one of Persian men mixing with African women at multiple locations along the Swahili Coast around the turn of the first millennium, with each group contributing about half of the genes that are found in Swahili people today.",

              "Instead, most foreign influences \u2014 language, architecture, fashion, arts \u2014 were incorporated into a way of life that remained predominantly African in character, with social strictures, kinship systems and agricultural practices that reflected Indigenous traditions.",

              "A key step in all this research, said Dr.",
              "Kusimba and his colleagues, was their engagement with local Swahili communities.",

              "MOMBASA, Kenya \u2014 It is a tale of three cities.",
              "To the north up the Kenyan coast is Lamu Town, its small streets humming with the sounds of chisels and hammers crafting Swahili doors, and donkeys carrying heavy loads of coral limestone.",
              "Locals and tourists jockey for space in the zigzagging alleys, with shops selling everything from silver jewelry to body products made with locally grown baobab.",
              "Down the coast, in neighboring Tanzania, is Stone Town of Zanzibar, with its bustling fish market, where hauls of octopus and snapper come in daily from dhow boats, and countless Polish, English, Italian and Mandarin-speaking travelers shuffle through on tours that also take them to a memorial near the site of the city\u2019s former slave market.",
              "And between the two sits Old Town Mombasa and at its eastern tip, Fort Jesus, an imposing 16th-century structure built by the Portuguese, its multiple openings offering glorious views of the Indian Ocean, and gentle breezes that help stave off the coastal heat.",
              "But while these streets are busy, too, here in Old Town Mombasa, it\u2019s mostly locals, unlike in the other two locales, where throngs of tourists flood the streets.",
              "Lamu Old Town, Stone Town of Zanzibar and Fort Jesus are all UNESCO World Heritage sites, with Old Town Mombasa serving as a buffer zone, but Mombasa, unlike Lamu and Stone Town, is more of a stopover point en route to the Swahili Coast, an expanse of shoreline stretching from Somalia to Mozambique.",
              "So, any expectations locals might have had, of tourism arising from Fort Jesus becoming a World Heritage site, have not been met.",
              "\u201cWe could be as good as Zanzibar, as good as Lamu for tourism,\u201d said Peter Tolle, a local historian who guides tours in French, English and German.",
              "\u201cLocals don\u2019t want to talk about being a World Heritage site anymore and they feel shortchanged.",
              "Our houses are shabby, we have the money, but we cannot fix them.",
              "\u201d \u201cWe are trapped by their rules but there are no funds,\u201d he continued, referring to UNESCO regulations around the changes that can and cannot be made at and near World Heritage sites.",
              "Lamu Town, Stone Town and Fort Jesus exemplify the critiques that experts working in preservation and tourism level at UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List \u2014 a list of landmarks or natural areas that have been designated by the multilateral organization as having historical, scientific or cultural significance.",
              "These places include Machu Picchu, the historic center of Florence and the Taj Mahal.",
              "They contend that being on the list can be a poisoned chalice, of either overtourism or undertourism.",
              "On one side, there is, as Mr.",
              "Tolle suggested, an expectation that being added to the list will somehow be a game changer for the community, bringing in money not only from UNESCO but also from tourism-focused investments and infrastructure projects.",
              "But Mike Robinson, professor of cultural heritage at Nottingham Trent University in England, noted in an interview that, in reality \u201cthere is no money and it has to rely on donors.",
              "\u201d In addition, the international agency has been blamed for what the Italian journalist Marco D\u2019Eramo deemed UNESCOcide, when he wrote that being added to the list is a \u201ckiss of death\u201d and that it \u201call too often cures the disease by killing the patient\u201d;",
              "that is, in acknowledging that a site is worth protecting, UNESCO can, itself, drive unsustainable levels of tourism.",
              "Florence, Italy, where the Art for Tomorrow conference is taking place this week, became a World Heritage site in 1982, and it has long suffered from overtourism.",
              "It was estimated that in 2019, 15 million tourists \u2014 20 times Florence\u2019s population of 708,000 \u2014 visited the city that is home to the Uffizi Galleries and the Duomo di Firenze.",
              "Aptly, the subject of UNESCO sites will be explored at the conference.",
              "The annual event was founded by The New York Times, and is now convened by the Democracy & Culture Foundation, with panels moderated by Times journalists.",
              "That conversation will contribute to the debate over the heritage list, around what the benefits of being on it are, if in some places, the tourism the designation brings ruins a locale\u2019s charm, while in other cases, inclusion on the list brings unrealistic hopes for greater change.",
              "The idea for the UNESCO World Heritage list, which now has 1,157 sites, grew out of a project to rescue the monuments of Nubia, which include Abu Simbel, the site of two temples carved into a sandstone cliff in the Nubian Valley in Egypt in the 13th century B.",
              "C.",
              "In the 1950s, local engineers planned to build a dam along a portion of the Nile River to control flooding and generate electricity.",
              "However, the dam would have flooded the valley and submerged hundreds of ancient monuments, so the Egyptian and Sudanese governments turned to UNESCO for help.",
              "The resulting project, during which Abu Simbel was moved, in pieces, up to a higher altitude, helped spark the 1972 Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, which set up the heritage list.",
              "Interestingly, tourism was mentioned only once in the document that arose from that convention, in relation to the threat it could pose to sites.",
              "\u201cBut, of course, we didn\u2019t have the scope of international tourism then,\u201d said Professor Robinson, who has done consulting for UNESCO on sustainable tourism, and who recognizes that tourism \u2014 in itself \u2014 doesn\u2019t always have to be detrimental.",
              "\u201cTime has moved on, we need to update that to say tourism is not just a threat, but it\u2019s also a valuable opportunity.",
              "\u201d It is difficult to assess the direct economic impacts of becoming a World Heritage site.",
              "For example, Dubrovnik, Croatia, is on the list, but the city\u2019s tourist invasion is very likely also related to the its role as a filming location for \u201cGame of Thrones.",
              "\u201d However, a 2015 report by the United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO discovered that Scottish UNESCO projects generated an estimated 10.",
              "8 million British pounds (or $13.",
              "4 million) from 2014 to 2015 through their connection with the heritage list.",
              "That has meant that a number of countries, often in the developing world, want to get their sites on the list.",
              "Professor Robinson said that was partly because state parties \u201csee it as a way of boosting tourism\u201d and so \u201cthe motivation has shifted from site protection to site valorization.",
              "\u201d There have been critiques that a change in who sits on the World Heritage Committee \u2014 a group of representatives from 21 countries who have final say over which sites are added to the list \u2014 has led to the list\u2019s being politicized.",
              "\u201cYou do get places moving forward for inscription that the advisory bodies have recommended not go forward because the care isn\u2019t adequately in place,\u201d said Susan Macdonald, head of buildings and sites at the Getty Conservation Institute.",
              "\u201cWhen those places go on the list, when they clearly haven\u2019t got the right systems and policies and processes in place, there\u2019s always a problem.",
              "\u201d She added, however, that almost 50 percent of the heritage sites were in Europe and North America, so there was a feeling that the list needed to be more representative.",
              "UNESCO suggests that representatives to the World Heritage Committee be experts in preservation and conservation, but leaves the ultimate selection up to the countries themselves.",
              "\u201cSo, you started to get this shift from a completely expert body to one that was sort of a mixture,\u201d Ms.",
              "Macdonald said.",
              "\u201cAnd when that happens, you get lobbying.",
              "\u201d What often is not well articulated to local communities is that when sites \u2014 which include both cultural sites, like the Vietnamese town of Hoi An, and natural sites, like Yellowstone National Park \u2014 go on the list, it is the obligation of local and national governments of those countries to take care of everything from maintaining and marketing the site to controlling the number of tourists who visit.",
              "\u201cOnce a site is inscribed, it is first the responsibility of the government of the country where the site is located to put in place all measures to protect the site,\u201d said Lazare Eloundou Assomo, the director of the UNESCO World Heritage Center, which maintains the list.",
              "So, while UNESCO does help countries develop sustainable tourism practices and give advice, inclusion on the list doesn\u2019t automatically mean solutions in terms of conservation or community development and investment.",
              "\u201cWhen you get something inscribed on the World Heritage List, it is not that the UNESCO police suddenly start coming in,\u201d joked Joseph King, senior director at the office of the director general at the International Center for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, who in the 1980s and \u201990s was a consultant for UNESCO.",
              "\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how many people actually think that is the case like, \u2018Why isn\u2019t UNESCO stopping this from happening?",
              "\u2019\u201d People like Mr.",
              "Tolle, the tour guide in Mombasa, find the whole process complicated and bureaucratic, and often misunderstand what becoming a site will mean for their communities.",
              "\u201cThey hear about it, and they understand it to be like the goose that laid the golden egg,\u201d said Ms.",
              "Macdonald.",
              "\u201cThat sometimes doesn\u2019t trickle down to them, unless governments have been careful to put in place systems and practices that empower local communities in the management of the place.",
              "\u201d Covid dramatized that point in places like Ethiopia\u2019s lower Omo Valley, a region inscribed to the list in 1980.",
              "Before 2020, and the onset of the pandemic and the war in the north of the country, tiny remote villages like Dildi would get around 15 tourists a day, and the villages became dependent on the extra cash.",
              "But now, according to local Mursi chief Baradi Birabi, the visitors have all but dried up.",
              "\u201cWith the money from tourists we could buy medicine for our people or our cattle,\u201d he said, as one of the villagers tried to sell a clay lip plate to a lone Israeli tourist.",
              "\u201cBut now we have to sell the cattle, so we do hope tourists will come back.",
              "\u201d That\u2019s a problem UNESCO is trying to work on, including a visitor flow management tool that will be extended to all sites by 2029, Peter DeBrine, who works on UNESCO\u2019s sustainable tourism program, wrote in an email.",
              "\u201cTourism can bring economic benefits to local communities and raise awareness about the importance of heritage preservation, but it can also have negative impacts on sites, such as overcrowding, societal changes, damage to fragile ecosystems and degradation of cultural monuments,\u201d he added.",
              "\u201cThis is why UNESCO has strengthened its responses and tools in this area, and that it is committed to the development of sustainable tourism.",

              "Its ornate stone and coral towns hugged 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) of the coast, and its merchants played a linchpin role in the lucrative trade between Africa and lands across the ocean: Arabia, Persia, India, Southeast Asia and China.",
              "By the turn of the second millennium, Swahili people embraced Islam, and some of their grand mosques still stand at the UNESCO World Heritage sites of Lamu in Kenya and Kilwa in Tanzania.",
              "Self-governance ended following Portuguese colonization in the 1500s, with control later shifting to the Omanis (1730-1964), Germans in Tanganyika (1884-1918) and British in Kenya and Uganda (1884-1963).",
              "Following independence, coastal peoples were absorbed into the modern nation-states of Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Madagascar.",
              "So who were the Swahili people, and where did their ancestors originally come from?",
              "Ironically, the story of Swahili origins has been molded almost entirely by non-Swahili people, a challenge shared with many other marginalized and colonized peoples who are the modern descendants of cultures of the past with extraordinary achievements.",
              "Working with a team of 42 colleagues, including 17 African scholars and multiple members of the Swahili community, we\u2019ve now published the first ancient DNA sequences from peoples of the Swahili civilization.",
              "Our results do not provide simple validation for the narratives previously advanced in archaeological, historical or political circles.",
              "Instead, they contradict and complicate all of them.",
              "Western archaeologists in the mid-20th century emphasized the connections of the medieval Swahili to Persia and Arabia, sometimes suggesting that their impressive achievements could not have been attained by Africans.",
              "Post-colonial scholars, including one of us (Kusimba), pushed back against that view.",
              "Earlier researchers had inflated the importance of non-African influences by focusing on imported objects at Swahili sites.",
              "They minimized the vast majority of locally made materials and what they revealed about African industry and innovation.",
              "But viewing Swahili heritage as primarily African or non-African is too simplistic.",
              "In fact, both perspectives are byproducts of colonialist biases.",
              "The truth is that colonization of the East African coast did not end with the departure of the British in the middle of the 20th century.",
              "Many colonial institutions were inherited and perpetuated by Africans.",
              "As modern nation-states formed, with governments controlled by inland peoples, Swahili people continued to be undermined politically and economically, in some cases as much as they had been under foreign rule.",
              "Decades of archaeological research in consultation with local people aimed to address the marginalization of communities of Swahili descent.",
              "Our team consulted oral traditions and used ethnoarchaeology and systematic surveys, along with targeted excavations of residential, industrial and cemetery locations.",
              "Working with local scholars and elders, we unearthed materials such as pottery, metal and beads;",
              "food, house and industrial remains;",

              "Together they revealed the complexity of Swahili everyday life and the peoples\u2019 cosmopolitan Indian Ocean heritage.",
              "Ancient DNA analysis was always one of the most exciting prospects.",
              "It offered the hope of using scientific methods to obtain answers to the question of how medieval people are related to earlier groups and to people today, providing a counterweight to narratives imposed from outside.",
              "Until a few years ago, this kind of analysis was a dream.",
              "But because of a technological revolution in 2010, the number of ancient humans with published genome-scale data has risen from nothing to more than 10,000 today.",
              "We worked with local communities to determine the best practices for treating human remains in line with traditional Muslim religious sensitivities.",
              "Cemetery excavations, sampling and reburial of human remains were carried out in one season, rather than dragging on indefinitely.",
              "Our team generated data from more than 80 people, mostly elite individuals buried in the rich centers of the stone towns.",
              "We will need to wait for future work to understand whether their genetic inheritance differed from people without their high status.",
              "Contradicting what we had expected, the ancestry of the people we analyzed was not largely African or Asian.",
              "Instead, these backgrounds were intertwined, each contributing about half of the DNA of the people we analyzed.",
              "We found that Asian ancestry in the medieval individuals came largely from Persia (modern-day Iran), and that Asians and African ancestors began mixing at least 1,000 years ago.",
              "This picture is almost a perfect match to the Kilwa Chronicle, the oldest narrative told by the Swahili people themselves, and one almost all earlier scholars had dismissed as a kind of fairy tale.",
              "Another surprise was that, mixed in with the Persians, Indians were a significant proportion of the earliest migrants.",
              "Patterns in the DNA also suggest that, after the transition to Omani control in the 18th century, Asian immigrants became increasingly Arabian.",
              "Later, there was intermarriage with people whose DNA was similar to others in Africa.",
              "As a result, some modern people who identify as Swahili have inherited relatively little DNA from medieval peoples like those we analyzed, while others have more.",
              "One of the most revealing patterns our genetic analysis identified was that the overwhelming majority of male-line ancestors came from Asia, while female-line ancestors came from Africa.",
              "This finding must reflect a history of Persian males traveling to the coast and having children with local women.",
              "One of us (Reich) initially hypothesized that these patterns might reflect Asian men forcibly marrying African women because similar genetic signatures in other populations are known to reflect such violent histories.",
              "But this theory does not account for what is known about the culture, and there is a more likely explanation.",
              "Traditional Swahili society is similar to many other East African Bantu cultures in being substantially matriarchal \u2013 it places much economic and social power in the hands of women.",
              "In traditional Swahili societies even today, ownership of stone houses often passes down the female line.",
              "And there is a long recorded history of female rulers, beginning with Mwana Mkisi, ruler of Mombasa, as recorded by the Portuguese as early as the 1500s, down to Sabani binti Ngumi, ruler of Mikindani in Tanzania as late as 1886.",
              "Our best guess is that Persian men allied with and married into elite families and adopted local customs to enable them to be more successful traders.",
              "The fact that their children passed down the language of their mothers, and that encounters with traditionally patriarchal Persians and Arabians and conversion to Islam did not change the coast\u2019s African matriarchal traditions, confirms that this was not a simple history of African women being exploited.",
              "African women retained critical aspects of their culture and passed it down for many generations.",

              "By Elie Dolgin A long history of mercantile trade along the eastern shores of Africa left its mark on the DNA of ancient Swahili people.",
              "A new analysis of centuries-old bones and teeth collected from six burial sites across coastal Kenya and Tanzania has found that, around 1,000 years ago, local African women began having children with Persian traders \u2014 and that the descendants of these unions gained power and status in the highest levels of pre-colonial Swahili society.",
              "The findings help elucidate the foundations of Swahili civilization, and suggest that long-told origin stories, passed down through generations of Swahili families, may be more truthful than many outsiders have presumed.",
              "\u201cThe genetics corroborate the Swahili people\u2019s own history that they tell about themselves, not what others were saying about them,\u201d said Esther Brielle, a geneticist and postdoctoral fellow at Harvard who led the DNA analysis with her adviser, David Reich.",
              "The researchers published their findings on Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
              "The Swahili Coast is a narrow strip of land that stretches some 2,000 miles along the Eastern African seaboard \u2014 from modern-day Mozambique, Comoros and Madagascar in the south, to Somalia in the north.",
              "In its medieval heyday, the region was home to hundreds of port towns, each ruled independently, but with a common religion (Islam), language (Kiswahili) and culture.",
              "Many towns grew immensely wealthy thanks to a vibrant trading network with merchants who sailed across the Indian Ocean on the monsoon winds.",
              "Middle Eastern pottery, Asian cloths\u200c\u200c and other luxury goods came in.",
              "African gold, ivory and timber\u200c\u200c went out \u2014 along with a steady flow of enslaved people, who were shipped off and sold across the Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf.",
              "(Slave trading later took place between the Swahili coast and Europe as well.)",
              "A unique cosmopolitan society emerged that blended African customs and beliefs with those of the foreign traders, some of whom stuck around and assimilated.",
              "Islam, for example, arrived from the Middle East and became an integral part of the Swahili social fabric, but with coral-stone mosques built and decorated in a local, East African style.",
              "Or consider the Kiswahili language, which is Bantu in origin but borrows heavily from Indian and Middle Eastern tongues.",
              "The arrival of Europeans, beginning around 1500, followed by Omani sailors some 200 years later, changed the character of the region.",
              "Yet, aspects of the heritage and traditions that took root in the Middle Ages remain evident in East Africa today.",
              "Researchers who have studied the region have long debated where those influences came from.",
              "At first, most scholars thought that the civilization, with its lavish mosques and ornate housewares, must have been the achievement of a foreign ruling class that established outposts in East Africa.",
              "But over the past 40 years, archaeologists, linguists and historians have come to see Swahili society as predominantly homegrown \u2014 with outside elements adopted over time that had only a marginal impact.",
              "That African-centric version of Swahili roots never sat well with the Swahili people themselves, though.",
              "They generally preferred their own origin story, one in which princes from present-day Iran (then known as Persia) sailed across the Indian Ocean, married local women and enmeshed themselves into East African society.",
              "Depending on the narrative source, that story dates to around 850 or 1000 \u2014 the same period during which genetic mixing was underway, according to the DNA analysis.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s remarkably spot on,\u201d said Mark Horton, an archaeologist at the Royal Agricultural University of England who has worked on the Swahili coast for decades.",
              "\u201cThis oral tradition was always maligned,\u201d added George Abungu, an archaeologist and former director-general of the National Museums of Kenya (who, like Dr.",
              "Horton, was not involved in the genetic analysis).",
              "\u201cNow, with this DNA study, we see there was some truth to it.",
              "\u201d The ancient DNA study is the largest of its kind from Africa, involving 135 skeletons dating to late-medieval and early-modern times, 80 of which have yielded analyzable DNA.",
              "To figure out where these people came from, the researchers compared genetic signatures from the dug-up bones with cheek swabs or saliva samples taken from modern-day individuals living in Africa, the Middle East and around the world.",
              "The burial-site DNA traced back to two primary sources: Africans and present-day Iranians.",
              "Smaller contributions came from South Asians and Arabs as well, with foreign DNA representing about half of the skeletons\u2019 genealogy.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s surprising that the genetic signature is so strong,\u201d said Jeffrey Fleisher, an archaeologist at Rice University who helped excavate the Tanzanian sites included in the analysis.",
              "He had predicted that the genetic influence from outside of Africa would be much smaller, he said.",
              "Different patterns of inheritance for different stretches of DNA have revealed how the genetic mixing came about.",
              "Gene sequences from tiny power factories inside the cell, known as mitochondria, were overwhelmingly African in origin.",
              "Since children inherit these bits of DNA only from their mothers, the researchers inferred that the maternal forbearers of the Swahili people were mostly of African descent.",
              "By comparison, the Y chromosome, passed from father to son, was chock-full of Asian DNA that the researchers found was common in modern-day Iran.",
              "So, a large fraction of Swahili ancestry presumably came from Persian men.",
              "The picture that emerges is one of Persian men mixing with African women at multiple locations along the Swahili Coast around the turn of the first millennium, with each group contributing about half of the genes that are found in Swahili people today.",
              "(African men and Indian women added small amounts to the gene pool as well.)",
              "\u201cThe genetic evidence enriches our understanding of the history,\u201d said Abdul Sheriff, a historian and former museum curator in Zanzibar, Tanzania.",

              "\u201d Dr.",
              "Reich initially assumed that conquering men settled the region by force, displacing the local males in the process.",
              "\u201cMy hypothesis was that this was a genetic signature of inequality and exploitation,\u201d he said.",
              "This is what he had seen in other parts of the world.",
              "In the Americas, for example, where a history of colonization, enslavement and subjugation explains why almost all the foreign ancestry in African American and Latin American individuals comes from European males.",
              "But that turned out to be a \u201cnai\u0308ve expectation,\u201d Dr.",
              "Reich said, because \u201cit didn\u2019t take into account the cultural context in this particular case.",
              "\u201d In East Africa, Persian customs never came to dominate.",
              "Instead, most foreign influences \u2014 language, architecture, fashion, arts \u2014 were incorporated into a way of life that remained predominantly African in character, with social strictures, kinship systems and agricultural practices that reflected Indigenous traditions.",
              "\u201cSwahili was an absorbing society,\u201d said Adria LaViolette, an archaeologist at the University of Virginia who has worked on the East African coast for over 35 years.",
              "Even as the Persians who arrived influenced the culture, \u201cthey became Swahili,\u201d she said.",
              "One major caveat to the study: Nearly all the bones and teeth came from ornamental tombs that were located near grand mosques, sites where only the upper class would have been laid to rest.",
              "As such, Chapurukha Kusimba, one of the study\u2019s authors, said that the results might not be representative of the general populace.",
              "A Kenyan-born anthropological archaeologist from the University of South Florida, Dr.",
              "Kusimba is now looking for skeletons from less well-to-do burial sites along the Swahili coast.",
              "But until he has those gene sequences in hand, it will be impossible to say just how far-reaching the foreign influence has been on the DNA of people of Swahili descent.",
              "A key step in all this research, said Dr.",
              "Kusimba and his colleagues, was their engagement with local Swahili communities.",
              "Protocols for disinterring, sampling and reburying human remains were established in consultation with local religious leaders and community stakeholders.",
              "Under Islamic law, exhumations are permitted if they serve a public interest, including that of determining ancestry, according to Ebrahim Moosa, who studies Islamic law and ethics at the University of Notre Dame.",
              "Following the DNA analysis, project leaders convened meetings \u2014 at a museum hall in Kenya and alongside the ruins themselves in Tanzania \u2014 to present their findings ahead of publication and to discuss any community concerns around ethnic-identity politics that the results might raise.",
              "\u201cThere was a lot of enthusiasm and support\u201d for the study, Dr.",
              "Kusimba said, and the feedback given by the community leaders proved helpful in shaping the final manuscript.",
