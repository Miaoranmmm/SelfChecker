    "query": "What is the most unusual case of animal behavior that you have ever come across in your field of study, and can you tell us about the research that has been done on this phenomenon?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. There are many examples of unusual animal behavior that have been observed and studied by scientists. Here are some of them:\n\n- Penguins throw poop bombs at their neighbors by using their feet to fling their feces up to 1.3 meters (4.3 feet) away. This behavior may help them keep their nests clean and avoid diseases[^1^].\n- Lemurs secrete a stinky perfume from their wrists and rub it on their tails, then wave their tails at potential mates or rivals. This behavior may help them communicate their reproductive status and dominance[^1^].\n- Capuchin monkeys sometimes cannibalize their own kin, nibbling at the legs and feet of dead infants. This behavior may be a way of coping with grief or stress, or a form of learning[^1^].\n- Spiders use their front legs to catapult themselves away from hungry females who might eat them after mating. This behavior may help them avoid sexual cannibalism and increase their chances of reproducing with other females[^2^].\n- Sponges living in the deep sea feed on fossils of extinct tube worms with the help of bacteria. This behavior may help them survive in an environment with scarce food resources[^2^].\n- Aye-ayes, a type of lemur, pick their nose and eat what they find. This behavior may help them get rid of parasites or infections, or simply satisfy their curiosity[^2^].\n- Cockatoos learn how to open trash bins by watching and copying each other. This behavior may help them access more food sources in urban areas[^2^].\n- Octopuses throw shells, silt and algae at each other by using jets of water from their siphon. This behavior may be a form of communication or aggression[^2^].\n- Elephants, flamingos, dogs, buffalo and other animals have been reported to sense impending natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis and flee to safer places. This behavior may be due to their ability to detect subtle changes in the environment such as vibrations, sounds or smells[^3^].\n- Ants infected by a fungus that controls their brains and makes them climb to high places before killing them. This behavior may help the fungus spread its spores to other ants[^4^].\n\nThese are just some of the many strange and fascinating animal behaviors that have been discovered and researched by ethologists, the scientists who study animal behavior.",

              "Front page layout Site theme Jennifer Ouellette - Jul 4, 2020 6:45 pm UTC Nature is a brutal place, so during brooding, chinstrap and Ade\u0301lie penguins are reluctant to leave their eggs unguarded in the nest\u2014even to relieve themselves.",
              "But one also does not wish to sully the nest with feces.",
              "So instead, a brooding penguin will hunker down, point its rear end away from the nest, lift its tail, and let fly a projectile of poo\u2014thereby ensuring both the safety of the eggs and the cleanliness of the nest.",
              "Back in 2003, two intrepid physicists became fascinated by this behavior and were inspired to calculate the answer to a burning question: just how much pressure can those penguins generate to propel their feces away from the edge of their nests?",
              "Answer: about three times more pressure than a human could produce.",
              "That paper earned them a 2005 Ig Nobel Prize and lasting glory among those obsessed with pooping penguins.",
              "Now, a pair of a Japanese scientists has weighed in on the matter, calculating the projectile trajectory of expelled feces and recalculating the rectal pressure.",
              "These scientists reported on their findings in a draft paper they posted to the physics arXiv.",
              "According to Victor Benno Meyer-Rochow of the Research Institute of Luminous Organisms in Japan, a co-author of the original 2003 paper, these fecal findings all started with an expedition he led to Antarctica.",
              "Although he was collecting samples of local marine worms and tiny terrestrial insects called springworms for further study, he also took copious photographs of the many penguins in the region, which he used in his lectures.",
              "During a seminar at Kitasato University in Japan, a young woman asked about a slide showing a penguin brooding on its nest, wondering about the white and pink lines radiating outward.",
              "She interpreted them as \"decoration\" and asked how the penguins made them.",
              "\"I explained that a penguin stands up, moves to the edge of its nest, turns around, lifts its tail, and then shoots from its rear, which leaves a 30-40 cm long streak of semi-liquid whitish stuff behind,\" Meyer-Rochow wrote in a 2019 blog post.",
              "\"Everybody laughed\u2014with the exception of the questioner.",
              "She got red in her face and quietly sat down.\"",
              "(The color of the feces depends on the penguin's diet: if primarily fish, the poop is white.",
              "If the penguin has been feasting on krill, the poop takes on a pinkish hue.)",
              "Meyer-Rochow maintains that it wasn't a stupid question, particularly since it prompted him to take a closer look at his slides, among which he found several photographs that captured penguins mid-poop.",
              "Measuring the lengths of the streaks fanning out from the nest was a simple-enough matter.",
              "Estimating the height above ground and aperture of the cloaca\u2014the opening through which penguins defecate\u2014was equally simple.",
              "He also determined the surface \"stickiness\" of penguin dung.",
              "With that information, Meyer-Rochow and his co-author, Jozsef Gal of Lora\u0301nd Eo\u0308tvo\u0308s University in Hungary, were able to calculate the force that would be required to propel the poop 30-40 centimeters.",
              "Then they used that figure to estimate how much pressure penguins must exert to shoot their poo away from the nest.",
              "The answer: internal penguin pressures can reach 10 to 60 kilopascal (0.",
              "1 to 0.",
              "6 atmospheres, or 600 grams per square centimeter), significantly higher than the pressure the average human can exert when defecating.",
              "Meyer-Rochow said the pressure was comparable to \"at least one half of the pressure of our cars' tires,\" adding, \"Not bad for a little fellow one third the size of a human.\"",
              "However, the study did not address why the streaks radiate out from the nest in all directions with no noticeable preference.",
              "Is this dependent on wind direction, or does a penguin somehow \"choose\" where to fling its feces?",
              "That remains an unresolved question.",
              "In this latest paper, Hiroyuki Tajima of Kochi University and Fumiya Fujisawa of the Katsurahama Aquarium in Kochi, Japan, note that the original 2003 paper did not take the projectile trajectory of the penguin feces into account.",
              "Instead, it focused on a horizontal distance.",
              "Tajima and Fujisawa argue that the angle of ejection is not always horizontal, especially if the breeding environment is in a higher location\u2014or if the penguin is standing on a rock while defecating, for instance.",
              "Using Newton's equations, they calculated that the maximum flying distance of penguin poo is 1.",

              "39 feet.",
              "Tajima and Fujisawa also revisited the question of the rectal pressure required to achieve such a trajectory and found it would be a bit higher than the original estimation.",
              "They noted, however, that their simplified equations did not account for the hydrodynamics of feces in the air and in the stomach, \"which are left for future work.\"",
              "As for why they chose to revisit the physics of pooping penguins, \"These bombings sometimes embarrass keepers under breeding environments like an aquarium,\" the authors wrote.",

              "They then discovered that the forces at work were even more extreme than previously suggested.",
              "Pressure is measured in units called kilopascals (kPa), where 1 kPa is 1,000 newtons per square meter.",
              "In the new study, the scientists calculated that the pressure generated in the rectums of pooping penguins was as much as 28.",

              "Though Humboldt penguins stand only 28 inches (71 centimeters) tall, the scientists discovered that the birds can generate enough poo-propelling energy to send fecal \"bombs\" flying at speeds of nearly 5 mph (8 km/h), landing up to 53 inches (134 cm) away.",
              "This achievement would be comparable to an adult human shooting their feces to a distance of more than 10 feet (3 meters), Tajima told Live Science in an email.",
              "Victor Benno Meyer-Rochow, lead author of the 2003 study, declared that he was \"very pleased that other researchers have taken up our ideas to look into penguin pooping,\" according to Improbable Research, the humorous science organization that awarded Benno Meyer-Rochow the 2005 Ig Nobel Prize.",

              "Nevertheless, \"it is of course possible that either we missed that or that these penguins sometimes do that when they stand on an uneven rock and/or bend forward more than what we had observed,\" Benno Meyer-Rochow told Improbable Research.",

Researchers discovered the underwater mountain in 2011, while mapping uncharted Arctic waters along the ocean-bottom Gakkel Ridge.",
              "When they sent a camera-laden sled through the ice and down to the mountaintop, the scientists were surprised to find it crawling with thousands of large, round, squishy, featureless animals covered in hair-like bristles.",
              "\"We saw no sea floor.",
              "We only saw life.",
              "There was one sponge on top of the other, and they were huge,\" Antje Boetius, a deep-sea biologist at the Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marine Research, who led the research, told Insider.",
              "As Boetius's team studied the sponges, they learned strange details about them.",
              "On average, the sponges on this mountain are 300 years old.",
              "Some of them are slowly moving, which surprised the scientists because nobody had ever documented wild sponges traveling.",
              "Boetius and her colleagues could see the tracks where the creatures had crawled uphill.",
              "But one question remained: What were the sponges eating?",
              "On many deep-sea mountains, ocean currents carry nutrients that rain down on the mountaintop and feed the organisms living there.",
              "But on this mountain, the scientists' measurements turned up no such nutrients, and no other food sources.",
              "It was a mystery, Boetius said: \"In the middle of nowhere, close to North Pole, in the most nutrient-poor environment on Earth, why do we have the largest accumulation of sponges that was ever recorded in the deep sea?\"",
              "After about five years of expeditions to Gakkel Ridge, the researchers determined that these sponges are thriving in inhospitable waters by digesting the fossilized remains of a vast community of extinct worms. Their findings were published in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday.",
              "The study follows another polar-ocean discovery that Boetius's colleagues at the Helmholtz Center announced in January: a nest of 60 million icefish breeding in an Antarctic sea.",
              "\"To me, this just means we just don't know enough about the oceans,\" Boetius said, adding, \"I sometimes call it a foreign planet on planet Earth, because it's so full of unknown life.\"",
              "As the scientists scanned the mountaintop for signs of sponge food, they saw crispy black strings everywhere.",
              "The material formed thick mats in some places.",
              "Boetius remembered that deep-sea volcanoes often vent gasses like methane and sulfur, which can be converted into energy \u2014 a crucial resource in a place devoid of sunlight.",
              "She had previously studied deep-sea methane vents, and among the most common forms of life around those vents were tube worms. With further testing, the researchers determined that the black strings covering the mountaintop were the remnants of ancient tube worms \u2014 and many of the tubes were emptied out.",
              "Perhaps the mysteries of the disappearing worm fossils and the missing food source were related.",
              "The researchers turned to the sponges they'd captured and analyzed the microbes that filled their bodies, since sponges are often more bacteria than sponge.",
              "They discovered the sponges \"have enzymes and tools to digest detritus \u2014 very old fossilized detritus,\" Boetius said, adding, \"It was all about old, degraded material.\"",
              "The smoking gun was that the sponges carried the same nitrogen and carbon isotopes as the worm tubes they sat upon.",
              "\"It was just a huge, Sherlock Holmes-like detective private-eye project,\" Boetius said, adding, \"We had a riddle to solve, and it took a very long to have all the data together.\"",
              "The researchers found no signs of methane venting, nor a single living worm.",
              "The volcano is inactive, and the worms died out thousands of years ago, but their remains now feed a thriving community of otherworldly creatures.",
              "It's not clear when the sponges will run out of dead worms to eat, but Boetius thinks their numbers will drop drastically once the fossils are gone.",
              "A few sponges may survive by eating the occasional algae falling from above or crustacean poop floating past.",
              "Boetius, however, is thinking about more fast-approaching upheavals to ocean ecosystems. She fears that climate change, plastics, and pollution are changing the seas faster than researchers can survey them.",
              "Oceans cover 70% of Earth's surface, and an estimated 80% of those waters remain unmapped and unexplored, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
              "The temperature and acidity of the oceans are rising, and their ecosystems are especially threatened at the Earth's poles, which are warming faster than anywhere else on the planet and rapidly losing sea-ice cover.",
              "Boetius hopes more deep-sea science expeditions like hers will study hard-to-reach ecosystems before they change with the climate.",
              "\"I think it is important that the diversity of life on Earth has at least a record, an image, a sample, a name, because they are maybe vanishing or changing,\" Boetius said.",

              "Many primates have also been recorded making use of tools, such as twigs, to pick their nose as well, which may extend the potential range of species beyond just those with fingers small enough to fit inside their nostrils.",
              "While some of the animals used in the study are captive, and so could be exhibiting abnormal behaviours, the researchers say that this cannot discount the possibility that nose picking is a widespread behaviour that remains to be properly understood.",
              "'The lack of study so far might relate to it being complicated to investigate, as it's the type of behaviour you might miss if you're not observing an individual all day,' Anne-Claire explains.",
              "'Mammals can be really elusive, which makes this even more difficult to observe.'",
              "'To resolve this, it would be interesting to survey researchers to see if they have observed this behaviour in the wild, and work with scientists in other disciplines to see if nose picking has a functional role or not.'",

              "Image\u807d\u6f0f\u807dEugen Haag/Shutterstock Nose picking, more formally known as 'rhinotillexis', is the act of extracting mucus from the nasal cavity, while eating it is technically called 'mucophagy'.",

              "But what research there is, aside from papers written as jokes, suggests the behaviour is very prevalent.",
              "For example, a survey of 254 Americans in the 1990s found that 91% of respondents said they picked their nose, with three quarters professing the belief that 'almost everyone does it.'",
              "The behaviour also appears to be independent of other factors such as sex, age and social class.",
              "Meanwhile, the 2001 Ig Nobel Prize for Public Health, an award that 'honours achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think', was given to two researchers who found that teenagers pick their nose on average four times a day.",
              "While nose picking may not seem like a serious field of study, it can have serious implications.",
              "It can become a compulsive behaviour called rhinotillexomania that has even been linked with a death.",
              "Understanding what its purpose is could therefore help make a small but important difference to people's lives.",
              "There are some suggestions that it's simply a response to discomfort as mucus dries in the nose, while others suggest it could provide a small amount of hydration.",
              "Some scientists believe that the microbes trapped within it could help maintain the resilience of our immune system.",
              "Meanwhile, another study suggests compounds in nasal mucus can reduce the ability of cavity-causing bacteria to attach to teeth, potentially contributing to our oral health.",
              "Before you start brushing your teeth with mucus, however, other research suggests that damage caused by nose picking can help bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus stick to the inside of the nose, while the act of picking itself can help spread microbes around.",
              "There is also an evolutionary aspect to unpicking rhinotillexis.",
              "Nose picking spans the major groups of primates, having been recorded in great apes and both Old and New World monkeys.",
              "The apparent reappearance of this behaviour across different groups suggests that it may have some evolutionary function, but the researchers are cautious about this.",
              "'With only 12 species in the study, it's very hard to say if this behaviour is ancestral to primates or has developed independently, or if it even has a role at all,' Anne-Claire says.",

              "But for cockatoos gazing down from the trees, the sight of wheelie bins can mean meal time.",
              "In recent years, there have been reports of cockies flipping open the lid of household waste bins to steal leftover food.",
              "And it turns out cockies pick up these lid-flipping skills by copying each other, allowing the behaviour to quickly spread across suburbs in New South Wales, according to a study published today in Science.",
              "Richard Major, an ecologist at the Australian Museum, said the birds' sharp skills are yet another example of their ability to thrive in urban areas.",
              "\"It really confirms that they are such winners at surviving in suburbia,\" said Dr Major, who co-authored the study.",
              "\"It's just amazing how they can exploit a new environment.\"",
              "It all started when Dr Major saw a sulphur-crested cockatoo up to no good on a wheelie bin in Stanwell Park, NSW in 2015.",
              "With his phone camera in hand, Dr Major captured a video of the thieving bird as it lifted the heavy bin lid with its beak and foot.",
              "The bird quickly shuffled along the edge of the bin to flip the lid over and dived in to rummage for food scraps.",
              "The clever cockie got Dr Major wondering whether this naughty behaviour was due to genetics or a skill the bird learnt from others.",
              "So he sent the video to study co-author Lucy Aplin, who studies social learning in animals at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour in Germany.",
              "The researchers knew a closer look was in order, but first they needed to find out if cockatoos in other areas were flipping bins too, or if it was just a quirk in Stanwell Park's cockies.",
              "In 2018, the team launched an online survey for residents living in 478 suburbs across Sydney and Wollongong.",
              "The two-year survey asked participants whether they had seen cockatoos cracking into wheelie bins in their suburb, and if so, when.",
              "Before the survey took place, bin-opening cockatoos had only been reported in three suburbs.",
              "Then it spread \u2014 fast.",
              "By late 2019, the birds had been seen lifting bin lids in 44 suburbs, indicating that it had quickly become a trend among their yellow-crested residents.",
              "\"That really blew me away,\" Dr Major said.",
              "Diving in deeper, Dr Major and his colleagues also found the bin-opening behaviour spread more quickly to cockatoos in neighbouring suburbs than those further away.",
              "This suggests that the cockies were picking up their bin-raiding skills from their mates.",
              "\"If it was something that wasn't learnt, you would expect it to turn up randomly across these suburbs,\" Dr Major said.",
              "Sulphur-crested cockatoos are real characters said co-author John Martin of the Taronga Conservation Society.",
              "\"I really love observing them and watching them observe me,\" he said.",
              "\"That's what's happened here with this new behaviour of bin opening, they've been observing each other and we've shown that they've been socially learning.\"",
              "The team also noticed that birds in different suburbs had developed their own style of lifting bin lids, indicating that they were likely copying birds from the same area.",
              "For instance, some birds grabbed the handle of the lid with their feet, while others used their beak.",
              "Some even used a mix of the two to crack open the lid.",
              "Next, the team took a closer look at which cockatoos were prying open household bins.",
              "The team marked 114 cockatoos with a dab of paint in Stanwell Park and noted their sex, weight and social dominance.",
              "They found only nine of the birds successfully flipped open the bins, with another 27 attempting the task but failing.",
              "Most of the successful bin raiders were dominant males, which tend to be larger and stronger than other cockatoos.",
              "The rest hung around and watched on as the bin-opening pioneer flipped the lid.",
              "\"It's not a puzzle that the birds are all solving by themselves,\" Dr Major said.",
              "\"One bird will solve the puzzle, and then because other birds are watching, they'll copy it.",
              "That's how the behaviour is spreading.\"",
              "Dr Martin said they don't yet know how the cockatoos started their bin foraging.",
              "\"Did the birds explore the bins or did they find a bin that was already open and therefore learn there was food and subsequently learn how to open a bin to get to the food?",
              "It's a mystery,\" he said.",
              "\"It isn't a desirable behaviour opening household bins, so there are a number of strategies to deter them, but it is a very fascinating behaviour from a scientific perspective because of innovation and the social learning component.\"",
              "Gisela Kaplan, a behavioural ecologist at the University of New England who specialises in birds, said that while the spread of bin-opening behaviour among cockatoos is fascinating, it's not clear from the study whether finding a meal was the biggest motivation behind their antics.",
              "\"There could be multiple explanations for this activity,\" said Professor Kaplan, who was not involved in the study.",
              "\"It can be mischief just for the sake of it, or just plain curiosity.\"",
              "She added that other bird species have also been known to pick up behaviours that don't have a clear benefit.",
              "For instance, blue tits have been seen stripping lids off of milk bottles, a quirk that has spread throughout populations in England, Professor Kaplan said.",
              "\"You can adopt new behaviours simply by watching.",
              "It doesn't have to have any greater motivation than that,\" she said.",
              "The next step for Dr Major and his team is to keep tracking the spread of bin-opening behaviour in cockatoos and investigate how they work around bins that have been cockie-proofed with rocks or bricks on their lids.",
              "\"There's plenty more learning to be done by cockatoos here, and we'll be following it,\" Dr Major said.",
              "Citizen scientists like Suzie Roessel continue to give the researchers extra eyes and ears across Sydney.",
              "She said many cockatoos visit her, but she hasn't seen them open bins yet.",
              "\"I have names for around 40 or 50 of them, we hang out on a daily basis,\" she said.",
              "\"I've seen them learn from each other, a few I\u2019ve trained to do footsies \u2013 they'll grab my finger with their foot.\"",

              "The most remarkable example of this behavior sounds almost too mischievous to be true: In at least two aquariums, Godfrey-Smith has written, octopuses \u201chave learned to turn off the lights by squirting jets of water at the bulbs when no one is watching, and short-circuiting the power supply.",
              "\u201d In the wild, octopus siphons also serve a variety of functions, Mather said.",

              "It\u2019s footage from Octopolis that revealed the unusual siphon behavior with new clarity: Octopuses there commonly gather debris in their arms \u2014 silt, algae, or shells \u2014 \u201cand then use the siphon to expel the material\u201d up to several body lengths away, the authors write in the study.",

              "Often, the animals used their siphons to propel objects out of their dens or discard the remains of food, the authors write.",
              "But in many cases, they seemed to be launching debris toward a target.",
              "In more than a dozen cases that the scientists observed, octopuses hit other octopuses with debris.",

              "It is quite amusing.",
              "\u201d In another example, a male octopus was \u201crebuffed in a mating attempt,\u201d the authors write, and then proceeded to throw something of a tantrum: \u201cHe threw a shell, changed color, and appeared to accelerate his breathing.",
              "\u201d The octopuses also threw debris toward fish and toward an underwater camera that was close to their dens, the authors write.",
              "Before some throws, the animals even seem to orient their bodies toward the target, according to the study.",
              "The authors say these behaviors suggest that octopuses are capable of deliberately launching objects at other animals, perhaps with the intention of hitting them.",
              "\u201cOctopuses can thus definitely be added to the shortlist of animals who regularly throw or propel objects, and provisionally added to the shorter list of those who direct their throws on other animals,\u201d they wrote.",
              "But Mather and other outside experts aren\u2019t convinced that octopuses pick up an item to launch at a target.",

              "Amodio, meanwhile, says it\u2019s likely that octopuses do pick up debris for the purpose of launching \u2014 but he has doubts about \u201cthe intention to hit the other individual with the object.",
              "\u201d They might just propel the object in the general direction of a nuisance, he said.",
              "Godfrey-Smith, for his part, acknowledges that it\u2019s challenging to work out whether or not hits are intentional.",
              "Nonetheless, he\u2019s convinced that octopuses are, in fact, targeting each other.",
              "When a female octopus is repeatedly launching junk at a male, it\u2019s hard to see it any other way.",
              "\u201cYou don\u2019t need to clean your den that much,\u201d he said, and the male is \u201cexpecting to be hit because he\u2019s ducking.",

              "Does that mean they\u2019re even more intelligent than we thought?",
              "The question itself is fraught, as it suggests that there\u2019s some universal idea of what it means to be intelligent.",

              "The spores attach to the ant and germinate, spreading through the host's body via long tendrils called mycelia.",
              "Cordyceps essentially turns its host into a zombie slave, compelling the ant to climb to the top of the nearest plant and clamp its tiny jaws in a death grip around a leaf or twig.",
              "The fungus then slowly devours the ant, sprouting through its head in one final indignity.",
              "Then the bulbous growths on the ends of the mycelia burst, releasing even more spores into the air, to infect even more unsuspecting ants.",
              "It's not a great way to go: the entire process can take four to 14 days.",
              "There are more than 400 different species of Cordyceps fungi, each targeting a particular species of insect, whether it be ants, dragonflies, cockroaches, aphids, or beetles.",
              "The zombification aspect has made the fungus a favorite of nature documentaries.",
              "It has also worked its way into popular culture, such as the zombie-apocalypse video game, The Last of Us (2013), in which a parasitic fungus mutates so that it also infects humans.",
              "But scientists are keen to study Cordyceps to learn more about the origins and intricate mechanisms behind these kinds of pathogen-based diseases.",
              "David Hughes, an entomologist at Penn State University, has been studying the fascinating relationship between carpenter ants and their parasitic partner, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, for years, in hopes of learning more about how the fungus controls its doomed host.",
              "Prior research showed that the zombification might be due to the release of a special chemical that causes the muscles in the infected ants' mandibles to contract forcefully for that death-grip bite.",
              "Back in 2017, Prof.",
              "Hughes and his team scanned ultra-thin slices of infected ants under a powerful microscope to build a 3D model, painstakingly marking which parts were ant and which were fungus.",
              "That gave them a much more detailed look at what was happening structurally at the cellular level.",
              "They found a surprisingly high percentage of fungal cells in the ants' bodies.",
              "The cells were concentrated directly outside the brain without ever penetrating the brain.",
              "Instead, the fungal cells formed an elaborate, interconnected 3D network, enabling them to communicate with each other and exchange nutrients.",
              "They essentially cut the brain off from the rest of the ant's body, so the networked cells can control its behavior.",
              "As Ed Yong wrote in The Atlantic, \"The ant ends its life as a prisoner in its own body.",
              "Its brain is still in the driver's seat, but the fungus has the wheel.\"",
              "Now, the Hughes lab is back with a new paper in Experimental Biology.",
              "This latest study \"gives us a broader picture of the fungus-host interactions that are occurring in the mandible [jaw] muscles of infected ants at the time of biting,\" said Penn State's Colleen Mangold, a co-author on the paper.",
              "Those interactions are likely what's behind that death-grip bite, since the fungus doesn't actually directly attach to an infected ant's brain.",
              "Rather, it breaks apart the membrane that covers jaw-muscle fibers, causing contractions strong enough to damage or destroy the muscle filaments that slide past each other when the muscles contract.",
              "Since this particular fungus thrives in hot, humid environments (Brazil or South Carolina), the U-Penn scientists recreated a similar environment in the lab.",
              "They collected spores from infected ants and injected them into healthy ants in the lab.",
              "The trick here was determining the correct spore dosage.",
              "\"If we inject with too few spores, the ant can fight off the infection,\" said Mangold.",
              "\"However, if we inject too many, the ant could die shortly after inoculation with no behavioral change.",
              "So we had to find a dosage somewhere in between.\"",
              "The lab environment was designed to resemble free-roaming conditions, not an ant colony nest.",
              "\"The fungus is unable to develop to a mature, infectious stage inside ant nests,\" said Mangold.",
              "\"This is probably due to the fact that healthy ants sometimes physically remove infected ants from the nest, and/or conditions within the nest\u2014like humidity or temperature\u2014are not optimal for fungal growth.",
              "When an infected ant is away from the nest, the fungus can grow and mature, and infectious spores can be released.\"",
              "As the infected insects were dying, Mangold et al.",
              "froze them and removed the jaw muscles for preservation.",
              "Then they studied those tissues under a scanning electron microscope (SEM).",
              "Those images clearly showed the fungus filaments penetrating the muscle tissue, but the neuromuscular junctions\u2014where nerve signals from the brain would enter the muscles to control their movement\u2014remained intact, indicating that the fungus is not directly affecting an infected ant's brain.",
              "The team also observed strange vesicle-like particles attached to infected tissue, although it's not clear whether those are being produced by the fungus or the host ant.",
              "The team will next attempt to isolate the bead-like vesicles to learn a bit more about them.",
              "\"We want to know if they come from the fungus or the host and what is packaged inside them,\" said Mangold.",
              "If the vesicles come from the fungus, that would suggest whatever is inside plays a role in the muscle contraction\u2014perhaps by secreting some substance that causes spasms in the muscle\u2014or mediates the communication between fungal cells.",
              "If the vesicles come from the host ants, the contents could be an immune response of some kind.",
              "Either way, \"Understanding more about these vesicles may help provide insight into the host-pathogen interactions that may contribute to the death-grip,\" said Mangold.",
              "Carpenter ants aren't the only species who are targets for this kind of zombie-like infection;",
              "they're just one of the most well-known.",
              "\"There are a number of other systems where we see behavioral changes in hosts infected by a microbe,\" said Mangold, pointing to ants infected with Pandora formicae as one example.",
              "\"However, the specific mechanisms underlying host behavioral change may differ between the two systems. That's why it will be interesting to study each system and see where our findings are similar and where they are different.\"",
