    "response": "Improving sleep quality is a common goal for many people who want to enhance their health and well-being. According to various sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^], some of the most effective and evidence-based approaches to improving sleep quality are:\n\n- Increasing bright light exposure during the day, which helps keep your circadian rhythm healthy and tells your brain when to be awake and when to be sleepy[^1^].\n- Reducing blue light exposure in the evening, which can interfere with your circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep[^1^]. You can do this by avoiding screens, wearing glasses that block blue light, or using apps that filter blue light on your devices.\n- Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and other chemicals that can disrupt your sleep quality or make it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep[^1^] [^3^]. You should avoid consuming these substances for four to six hours before bedtime, or limit them to one or two drinks per day at most.\n- Making your bedroom a comfortable, quiet, dark, and cool environment that is conducive to sleep[^2^] [^3^]. You can use curtains, shades, eye masks, earplugs, fans, air conditioners, humidifiers, or white noise machines to create a sleep-inducing environment. You should also make sure your mattress, pillows, sheets, and blankets are comfortable and suitable for your preferences.\n- Establishing a relaxing and consistent pre-sleep routine that helps you wind down and prepare for bed[^2^] [^3^]. You can do activities such as reading, listening to soothing music, meditating, stretching, or taking a warm bath or shower. You should avoid stressful, stimulating, or arousing activities such as work, arguments, exercise, or watching TV right before bed.\n- Sticking to a regular sleep schedule that aligns with your natural body clock and allows you to get enough sleep for your needs[^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. You should try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends and holidays. This helps your body establish a stable sleep rhythm and makes it easier to fall asleep and wake up. You should aim for at least seven hours of sleep per night, but some people may need more or less depending on their age, lifestyle, and health conditions.\n- Avoiding naps during the day, especially in the afternoon or evening, which can interfere with your nighttime sleep quality and quantity[^1^] [^3^]. If you do nap, limit it to 20 minutes or less and do it before 3 p.m. Napping can be beneficial for some people who have irregular schedules or need a short boost of energy, but it can also make it harder to fall asleep at night or cause you to sleep less deeply.\n- Exercising regularly and moderately during the day, which can improve your physical and mental health and help you sleep better at night[^1^] [^3^] [^4^]. Exercise can reduce stress, improve mood, regulate blood sugar levels, and promote blood circulation. However, you should avoid exercising too close to bedtime (within three hours), as this can stimulate your body and make it harder to relax and fall asleep.\n\nThese are some of the most common and effective ways to improve your sleep quality. However, you may also benefit from other strategies depending on your specific situation and needs. For example, some people may find it helpful to use supplements or natural remedies such as melatonin, lavender oil, chamomile tea, or magnesium[^1^] [^4^]. Others may need to consult a doctor or a sleep specialist if they have underlying medical conditions or sleep disorders that affect their sleep quality.\n\nTo incorporate these practices into your daily routine, you may need to make some changes to your habits and lifestyle. You may also need to experiment with different methods and see what works best for you. Here are some tips on how to implement these practices:\n\n- Start with one or two changes at a time and gradually add more as you get used to them. Trying to change everything at once can be overwhelming and unrealistic.\n- Set realistic and specific goals for yourself and track your progress. For example, you can use a sleep diary or an app to record your sleep patterns and habits. You can also use a checklist or a reminder system to help you follow your routine.\n- Reward yourself for your achievements and celebrate your successes. For example, you can treat yourself to something you enjoy after a week of sticking to",

              "For example, while the absolute spectral distribution of a light is the most complete description, many investigators report the illuminance (in lux [lx]), or the correlated colour temperature, which is the temperature of a hypothetical black-body radiator with the same colour as the light source in question.",
              "Unfortunately, until recently, there have been no standard quantities that experimenters were asked to report, and therefore, summarising the chronobiological and somnological literature on the effects of light remains a challenge.",
              "Recently, the Commission International de l\u2019Eclairage (CIE), the international standard body for quantities related to light, issued a new standard containing a reference framework for quantifying the effects of light on non-visual functions [31].",

              "The human circadian system integrates across multiple light exposures as short as five minutes [48], even intermittent bright light exposure can shift the circadian phase [43, 66].",
              "It has been shown that under certain circumstances, a train of very brief flashes light flashes on the millisecond scale can cause circadian phase shifts which are larger than those caused by continuous light [59, 108].",

              "As outlined above, light is the key zeitgeber in the circadian system and interacts with the master clock in the SCN via non-image-forming pathways connecting retina and SCN.",
              "Unsurprisingly, light therefore also affects sleep.",
              "Natural daylight at high intensities as experienced outside buildings has previously been shown to (1) advance the timing of sleep to earlier hours, (2) affect the duration of sleep, and (3) improve sleep quality.",
              "More precisely, the phase-advancing effects of daylight have for example been reported by Roenneberg and colleagues [67] who, using questionnaire data, found that each additional hour spent outdoors advanced sleep by ~30 min.",
              "Despite light being the strongest zeitgeber, this phase-advance could also result from physical exercise during daytime [102, 105], which is often confounded with time spent outdoors.",
              "The relative contributions of light and physical activity remain to be determined.",
              "Moreover, light exposure during the day has also been shown to affect sleep duration.",
              "Here, shorter daylight exposure and longer nights are associated with a longer biological night as indexed by the duration of melatonin secretion, and thus longer sleep duration [85, 94, 95], which may also reflect a seasonality effect [104].",
              "Likewise, exposure to daylight has been shown to increase sleep duration, possibly by advancing sleep timing [16].",
              "Beyond this, sleep quality is also related to light exposure during the day.",
              "Several studies report that daytime exposure to white light enriched in short-wavelength content was associated with increased evening fatigue [91], and sleep quality [16, 39, 91], decreased sleep-onset latency [39], and increased slow-wave sleep accumulation [92], which is related to the dissipation of the homeostatic sleep pressure [1, 14, 34].",
              "However, also the timing of light exposure seems to matter for sleep.",
              "In this context, Wams and colleagues [92] report that participants with later exposure to light >10 lx had more nocturnal awakenings and less slow-wave sleep.",
              "In sum, research seems to agree that daylight (at high intensities) is beneficial for sleep.",

              "It should be noted though that exposure to the \u201ccircadian-active\u201d light source was very long in these studies (4\u20136.",

              "Evaluating sleep objectively with electroencephalography (EEG), Mu\u0308nch and colleagues [58] found that exposure to short-wavelength light for two hours starting 3 h before habitual bedtime first lead to decreased slow wave activity (SWA) and thus shallower sleep.",
              "From this, the authors concluded that the alerting effects of short-wavelength light persist into sleep, which is in line with findings by Chellappa and colleagues [28], who reported a decrease in homeostatic sleep pressure following short-wavelength light exposure in the evening.",
              "However, short-wavelength light exposure in the evening was also associated with increased SWA later during the night, suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism [58].",

              "This pathway, connecting some ipRGCs with the habenula and bypassing the SCN altogether, has been suggested to specifically mediate light-induced alterations in mood [38].",

              "SAD is a subtype of depression characterised by strong seasonal variations in mood states.",
              "BLT is nowadays established as first-line treatment for SAD [61, 75] leading to an amelioration of symptoms after a few days of treatment.",
              "Light therapy is also effective as second-line treatment for non-seasonal depression, although it usually takes longer (2\u20135 weeks) than in SAD to achieve a therapeutic effect [2, 75, 87].",
              "BLT, especially in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can accelerate the clinical improvement and lead to significantly fewer residual symptoms [7, 53].",
              "In patients with chronic depression, BLT has been shown to lead to remarkable remission rates compared to placebo [41] and represents a valid therapeutic option also in gender-related mood disorders, such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder and perinatal depression [47, 96].",
              "BLT can be delivered by special, commercially available therapy lamps, which operate at illuminance levels between 7000 and 10,000 lx, but natural daylight during a regular one-hour morning walk has been shown to be similarly effective [99].",

              "g. delayed sleep\u2013wake phase disorder), or social withdrawal (patients with psychiatric disorders, elderly people), BLT provides an effective treatment and valid alternative to pharmacological approaches [98].",
              "Not only \u201cactive\u201d chronotherapeutic approaches, but also an adequate architectural design of the light environment may have relevant clinical implications for psychiatric patients.",
              "The availability of light in hospital rooms has been shown to decrease the length of stay of depressed patients in a clinic [6].",
              "Moreover, retrospective analyses revealed a three-day shorter hospitalisation in bipolar depressed inpatients exposed to natural light in sunny hospital rooms compared to those in darker rooms [8].",

              "In patients with anorexia or bulimia nervosa, light not only improves mood but also helps to better control specific disease-related symptoms (for a review see [5, 49]).",
              "Well-controlled longitudinal studies have demonstrated that light not only has antidepressant effects in age-related depression, but can also slow down the progressive cognitive decline in dementia [52, 65].",
              "More generally, due to its rhythm-synchronising properties and its enhancing effects on sleep quality and wakefulness, BLT is becoming an important tool in geriatric care, to treat sleep\u2013wake disturbances and reduce general listlessness [76].",
              "The stabilising effects of light also make BLT a useful additional treatment in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [69], borderline personality disorder [19], and other conditions characterised by sleep\u2013wake disruption, such as schizophrenia [18] or neurodegenerative diseases [103].",

              "Finally, one of the most common applications of light, often in combination with exogenous melatonin, is found in sleep medicine [70, 71] for the treatment of specific circadian rhythm sleep\u2013wake disorders (CRSWD), including advanced and delayed sleep\u2013wake phase disorder, jet lag, shift work, sighted non-24 and irregular sleep\u2013wake phase disorder (for diagnostic criteria see [89]).",

              "Alcohol reduced sleep efficiency by about one percent, on average, though it had no effects on sleep duration.",

              "Lastly, multicomponent interventions were commonly observed.",
              "In particular, sleep education was often combined with behavior change methods, though physical exercise, mindfulness, and environmental modifications were sometimes combined with sleep education too.",
              "Although the 11 defined intervention types adequately describe the sleep health interventions in the included reviews, the distinctions between the intervention categories were sometimes not as straightforward as might be assumed.",
              "For example, giving sleep hygiene tips was considered sleep education, but these tips often suggest bedtime relaxation or creating a dark, quiet sleeping environment.",
              "One could then argue that education on sleep hygiene also has relaxation and environmental components.",
              "Furthermore, CBT and BCM partly share their theoretical underpinning.",
              "Nevertheless, CBT and BCM were considered as separate intervention types, as techniques as well as implementers varied considerably.",
              "However, in determining the 11 intervention types, the main focus of an intervention could always be identified.",
              "Three categories showed substantially more evidence for improving sleep duration and/or quality: behavior change methods, mind\u2013body exercise, and later school start times.",
              "These categories consistently demonstrated statistically significant improvements with relatively large effect sizes.",
              "Many reviews featuring behavior change methods and mind\u2013body exercise included rigorous RCT study designs.",
              "This included two meta-analyses primarily analyzing behavior change methods [33,62], and two meta-analyses of exclusively mind\u2013body exercises [54,57].",
              "Later school start times also demonstrated strong effects in two reviews with particularly large participant samples.",
              "The eight additional intervention types defined in this review also demonstrated some promising impacts on sleep, but with less research conducted and/or less consistent evidence.",
              "Some techniques demonstrated higher effectiveness than others within categories.",
              "For example, listening to music seemed to be more effective than other relaxation techniques.",
              "These conclusions should be interpreted with caution.",
              "There was heterogeneity in study designs, outcome measures, populations targeted, and specific techniques.",
              "Generalization is another concern, as some data is from narrow target groups or settings and results may not be applicable in other contexts.",
              "For instance, physical exercise to improve sleep was mostly implemented for women, and environmental interventions were mainly applied in healthcare settings.",
              "These interventions may not demonstrate similar effectiveness in other populations or settings.",
              "Moreover, there were contradictory findings regarding the relative effectiveness of some specific techniques within categories.",

              "This review had some notable limitations.",
              "First, overlapping of primary studies between reviews is a common limitation in umbrella reviews.",
              "However, only a small amount of overlap was detected with the CCA calculation [28].",
              "There was a high degree of heterogeneity, which made direct comparisons between reviews impossible.",
              "Publication bias may have limited what studies were published and included in reviews, which in turn may be a limitation of this umbrella review.",
              "Likewise, the quality of an umbrella review depends on the quality of the included reviews, which in turn depends on the quality of the primary studies.",
              "Therefore, there may be some undetected sources of bias.",
              "However, it is reassuring that the quality scores of most included reviews were strong.",
              "A strength of this review was the broad variety of electronic databases in its search strategy, allowing a broad overview of all possible types of non-pharmacological interventions used across all age groups and settings.",
              "Two reviewers conducted the entire screening, data extraction, and quality assessment independently, increasing the validity of the extracted data and methodological strength of the research.",
              "Sleep health promotion has been gaining attention in public health, and effective interventions are being developed that improve sleep duration and quality in the general population.",
              "Currently, policies regarding sleep have been implemented within different countries and organizations, including later school start times, regulations for shift worker hours, and public education on sleep health [59,68].",

              "This review also suggests recommendations for future research.",
              "As previously mentioned, some intervention types have only targeted specific groups or have not been investigated thoroughly.",
              "For instance, mind\u2013body and physical exercise has had promising results among adults and elderly people, so future research could demonstrate if this approach would be effective in children or adolescents.",
              "In this age of smartphone technology, apps may be a new channel for sleep intervention implementation, which could be further explored (e.",
              "g., to implement behavior control methods more systematically).",
              "In the included reviews, the lack of behavioral theory in intervention development was surprising.",
              "Behavioral theory is used to effectively predict and alter many health behaviors, but its use has been very limited in sleep health [69,70].",
              "In fact, only one included review specifically reported and emphasized the foundations of behavioral theory within its interventions [37].",
              "While there is a small amount of research regarding the factors influencing sleep health and sleep behaviors [71,72], most interventions were not developed explicitly considering these factors, nor how they apply to specific target groups.",
              "More research into sleep-related factors and the application of theoretical frameworks of behavior change are lacking in the literature, requiring further research.",
              "To steer the reporting and comparability of reviews, following PRISMA guidelines is also heavily encouraged in future reviews.",
              "This umbrella review is the first to provide an overview of strategies used in the rapidly evolving field of sleep health promotion, shedding light on target populations and intervention settings.",
              "Later school start times, behavior change methods, and mind\u2013body exercise provided the most evidence of effectively improving sleep.",
              "Other interventions, such as sleep education, relaxation techniques, physical exercise, aromatherapy, massage, psychotherapy, and environmental interventions, also showed promising but inconsistent or limited results.",

              "Yoder et al12 determined that 45% of adult patients with a Medical Early Warning Score of \u22641 were still awakened overnight for vital sign checks, despite a less than 1% chance of an adverse event.",
              "This finding suggests that it would be safe and more cost-effective to minimize distributing patients\u2019 sleep, as the current practice, when it has few benefits to the quality of care.",
              "At the study institution, an urban, academic university medical center, it is the norm to perform vital signs every 4 hours on all hospitalized, non-PICU patients and obtain routine laboratory studies in the early morning hours, usually at 4 am.",
              "As a result, the physician and nursing staff collaborated to create a quality improvement (QI) initiative to minimize nighttime interruptions in clinically stable hospitalized pediatric patients by utilizing passive, noninterruptive vital signs (ie, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry measurements) overnight and changing the time of routine laboratory draws.",
              "This QI initiative\u2019s primary goal was to assess whether minimizing nighttime interruptions would negatively impact patient safety as measured by an increase in transfers to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) or rapid response team (RRT) activations.",

              "From this review of the baseline data, the QI team consisting of physicians and nurses developed the inclusion and exclusion criteria.",
              "Specifically, eligible patients were those who met all of the following inclusion criteria: age 10 years and older, medical (nonsurgical) patients admitted to the ACP unit, not receiving opiate medication in the last 12 hours, not requiring frequent vital sign checks for medications or infusions (ie, intravenous immunoglobulin or packed red blood cell transfusion), Pediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS) \u22642 at 8 pm and midnight vitals, and physician and parents/guardians had not requested a full set of vitals at 4 am.",
              "We chose the age of 10 years because older children were likely to answer nurses\u2019 questions regarding pain without parental help as some patients did not have parents staying with them.",
              "The total PEWS of 2 or less was chosen because no active intervention was needed based on the institution\u2019s PEWS algorithm.",
              "Patients admitted to the intermediate care unit, or PICU would need frequent monitoring by physicians and nurses.",
              "Surgical patients were excluded because the surgical services did not wish to participate in the QI initiative.",
              "Finally, the rest of the exclusion criteria would require frequent nursing assessments.",
              "Using these criteria, we identified 166 patient encounters within this time frame.",
