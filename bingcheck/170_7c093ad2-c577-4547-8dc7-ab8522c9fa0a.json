              "The first measurement is the total amount of light emitted by a large structure, like a galaxy, which astronomers can use to infer that object's mass.",
              "The second measurement is the estimated amount of gravity needed to hold the large structure together.",
              "When astronomers compare these measurements on galaxies and clusters throughout the universe, they get the same result: There simply isn't enough normal, light-emitting matter to account for the amount of gravitational force needed to hold those objects together.",
              "Thus, there must be some form of matter that is not emitting light: dark matter.",
              "Related: The states of matter: definitions and phases Different galaxies have different proportions of dark matter to normal matter.",
              "Some galaxies contain almost no dark matter, while others are nearly devoid of normal matter.",
              "But measurement after measurement gives the same average result: Roughly 85% of the matter in the universe does not emit or interact with light.",
              "There are many other ways astronomers can validate this result.",
              "For example, a massive object, like a galaxy cluster, will warp space-time around it so much that it will bend the path of any light passing through \u2014 an effect called gravitational lensing.",
              "Astronomers can then compare the amount of mass that we see from light-emitting objects to the mass needed to account for the lensing, again proving that extra mass must be lurking somewhere.",
              "Astronomers can also use computer simulations to look at the growth of large structures.",
              "Billions of years ago, our universe was much smaller than it is today.",
              "It took time for stars and galaxies to evolve, and if the universe had to rely on only normal, visible matter, then we would not see any galaxies today.",
              "Instead, the growth of galaxies required dark matter \"pools\" for the normal matter to collect in, according to a lecture by cosmologist Joel Primack Lastly, cosmologists can look back to when the cosmos was only a dozen minutes old, when the first protons and neutrons formed.",
              "Cosmologists can use our understanding of nuclear physics to estimate how much hydrogen and helium were produced in that epoch.",
              "These calculations accurately predict the ratio of hydrogen to helium in the present-day universe.",
              "They also predict an absolute limit to the amount of baryonic matter in the cosmos, and those numbers agree with observations of present-day galaxies and clusters, according to astrophysicist Ned Wright.",
              "Alternatively, dark matter may be a misunderstanding of our theories of gravity, which are based on Newton's laws and Einstein's general relativity.",
              "Astronomers can tweak those theories to provide explanations of dark matter in individual contexts, like the motions of stars within galaxies.",
              "But alternatives to gravity have not been able to explain all the observations of dark matter throughout the universe.",

              "How might dark matter interact with ordinary matter?",
              "An international team of scientists that includes University of California, Riverside, physicist Hai-Bo Yu has imposed conditions on how dark matter may interact with ordinary matter -- constraints that can help identify the elusive dark matter particle and detect it on Earth.",
              "Dark matter -- nonluminous material in space -- is understood to constitute 85 percent of the matter in the universe.",
              "Unlike normal matter, it does not absorb, reflect, or emit light, making it difficult to detect.",
              "Physicists are certain dark matter exists, having inferred this existence from the gravitational effect dark matter has on visible matter.",
              "What they are less certain of is how dark matter interacts with ordinary matter -- or even if it does.",
              "In the search for direct detection of dark matter, the experimental focus has been on WIMPs, or weakly interacting massive particles, the hypothetical particles thought to make up dark matter.",
              "But Yu's international research team invokes a different theory to challenge the WIMP paradigm: the self-interacting dark matter model, or SIDM, a well-motivated framework that can explain the full range of diversity observed in the galactic rotation curves.",
              "First proposed in 2000 by a pair of eminent astrophysicists, SIDM has regained popularity in both the particle physics and the astrophysics communities since around 2009, aided, in part, by work Yu and his collaborators did.",
              "Yu, a theorist in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UCR, and Yong Yang, an experimentalist at Shanghai Jiaotong University in China, co-led the team analyzing and interpreting the latest data collected in 2016 and 2017 at PandaX-II, a xenon-based dark matter direct detection experiment in China (PandaX refers to Particle and Astrophysical Xenon Detector;",
              "PandaX-II refers to the experiment).",
              "Should a dark matter particle collide with PandaX-II's liquefied xenon, the result would be two simultaneous signals: one of photons and the other of electrons.",
              "Yu explained that PandaX-II assumes dark matter \"talks to\" normal matter -- that is, interacts with protons and neutrons -- by means other than gravitational interaction (just gravitational interaction is not enough).",
              "The researchers then search for a signal that identifies this interaction.",
              "In addition, the PandaX-II collaboration assumes the \"mediator particle,\" mediating interactions between dark matter and normal matter, has far less mass than the mediator particle in the WIMP paradigm.",
              "\"The WIMP paradigm assumes this mediator particle is very heavy -- 100 to 1000 times the mass of a proton -- or about the mass of the dark matter particle,\" Yu said.",
              "\"This paradigm has dominated the field for more than 30 years.",
              "In astrophysical observations, we don't, however, see all its predictions.",
              "The SIDM model, on the other hand, assumes the mediator particle is about 0.",
              "001 times the mass of the dark matter particle, inferred from astrophysical observations from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters.",

              "There are not enough astronomers to keep monitoring so many stars, but today\u2019s automated telescopes and computer systems can do it for us.",
              "Research teams making observations of millions of stars in the nearby galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud have reported several examples of the type of brightening expected if MACHOs are present in the halo of the Milky Way (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\)).",
              "However, there are not enough MACHOs in the halo of the Milky Way to account for the mass of the dark matter in the halo.",
              "This result, along with a variety of other experiments, leads us to conclude that the types of matter we are familiar with can make up only a tiny portion of the dark matter.",
              "Another possibility is that dark matter is composed of some new type of particle\u2014one that researchers are now trying to detect in laboratories here on Earth (see The Big Bang).",
              "The kinds of dark matter particles that astronomers and physicists have proposed generally fall into two main categories: hot and cold dark matter.",
              "The terms hot and cold don\u2019t refer to true temperatures, but rather to the average velocities of the particles, analogous to how we might think of particles of air moving in your room right now.",
              "In a cold room, the air particles move more slowly on average than in a warm room.",
              "In the early universe, if dark matter particles easily moved fast and far compared to the lumps and bumps of ordinary matter that eventually became galaxies and larger structures, we call those particles hot dark matter.",
              "In that case, smaller lumps and bumps would be smeared out by the particle motions, meaning fewer small galaxies would get made.",
              "On the other hand, if the dark matter particles moved slowly and covered only small distances compared to the sizes of the lumps in the early universe, we call that cold dark matter.",
              "Their slow speeds and energy would mean that even the smaller lumps of ordinary matter would survive to grow into small galaxies.",
              "By looking at when galaxies formed and how they evolve, we can use observations to distinguish between the two kinds of dark matter.",
              "So far, observations seem most consistent with models based on cold dark matter.",
              "Solving the dark matter problem is one of the biggest challenges facing astronomers.",
              "After all, we can hardly understand the evolution of galaxies and the long-term history of the universe without understanding what its most massive component is made of.",
              "For example, we need to know just what role dark matter played in starting the higher-density \u201cseeds\u201d that led to the formation of galaxies.",
              "And since many galaxies have large halos made of dark matter, how does this affect their interactions with one another and the shapes and types of galaxies that their collisions create?",
              "Astronomers armed with various theories are working hard to produce models of galaxy structure and evolution that take dark matter into account in just the right way.",
              "Even though we don\u2019t know what the dark matter is, we do have some clues about how it affected the formation of the very first galaxies.",
              "As we will see in The Big Bang, careful measurements of the microwave radiation left over after the Big Bang have allowed astronomers to set very tight limits on the actual sizes of those early seeds that led to the formation of the large galaxies that we see in today\u2019s universe.",
              "Astronomers have also measured the relative numbers and distances between galaxies and clusters of different sizes in the universe today.",
              "So far, most of the evidence seems to weigh heavily in favor of cold dark matter, and most current models of galaxy and large-scale structure formation use cold dark matter as their main ingredient.",
              "As if the presence of dark matter\u2014a mysterious substance that exerts gravity and outweighs all the known stars and galaxies in the universe but does not emit or absorb light\u2014were not enough, there is an even more baffling and equally important constituent of the universe that has only recently been discovered: we have called it dark energy in parallel with dark matter.",
              "We will say more about it and explore its effects on the evolution of the universe in The Big Bang.",
              "For now, we can complete our inventory of the contents of the universe by noting that it appears that the entire universe contains some mysterious energy that pushes spacetime apart, taking galaxies and the larger structures made of galaxies along with it.",
              "Observations show that dark energy becomes more and more important relative to gravity as the universe ages.",
              "As a result, the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and this acceleration seems to be happening mostly since the universe was about half its current age.",
              "What we see when we peer out into the universe\u2014the light from trillions of stars in hundreds of billions of galaxies wrapped in intricate veils of gas and dust\u2014is therefore actually only a sprinkling of icing on top of the cake: as we will see in The Big Bang, when we look outside galaxies and clusters of galaxies at the universe as a whole, astronomers find that for every gram of luminous normal matter, such as protons, neutrons, electrons, and atoms in the universe, there are about 4 grams of nonluminous normal matter, mainly intergalactic hydrogen and helium.",
              "There are about 27 grams of dark matter, and the energy equivalent (remember Einstein\u2019s famous \\(E = mc^2\\)) of about 68 grams of dark energy.",
              "Dark matter, and (as we will see) even more so dark energy, are dramatic demonstrations of what we have tried to emphasize throughout this book: science is always a \u201cprogress report,\u201d and we often encounter areas where we have more questions than answers.",
              "Let\u2019s next put together all these clues to trace the life history of galaxies and large-scale structure in the universe.",
              "What follows is the current consensus, but research in this field is moving rapidly, and some of these ideas will probably be modified as new observations are made.",
              "Stars move much faster in their orbits around the centers of galaxies, and galaxies around centers of galaxy clusters, than they should according to the gravity of all the luminous matter (stars, gas, and dust) astronomers can detect.",
              "This discrepancy implies that galaxies and galaxy clusters are dominated by dark matter rather than normal luminous matter.",
              "Gravitational lensing and X-ray radiation from massive galaxy clusters confirm the presence of dark matter.",
              "Galaxies and clusters of galaxies contain about 10 times more dark matter than luminous matter.",
              "While some of the dark matter may be made up of ordinary matter (protons, neutrons, and electrons), perhaps in the form of very faint stars or black holes, most of it probably consists of some totally new type of particle not yet detected on Earth.",
              "Observations of gravitational lensing effects on distant objects have been used to look in the outer region of our Galaxy for any dark matter in the form of compact, dim stars or star remnants, but not enough such objects have been found to account for all the dark matter.",

              "Margot Brouwer, who led the research team, continues: \"Based on our tests, our original conclusion was that the two alternative gravity models and MICE matched the observations reasonably well.",
              "However, the most exciting part was yet to come: because we had access to over 259,000 galaxies, we could divide them into several types\u2014relatively young, blue spiral galaxies versus relatively old, red elliptical galaxies.\"",

              "However, there is a caveat: gas.",
              "Many galaxies are probably surrounded by a diffuse cloud of hot gas, which is very difficult to observe.",
              "If it were the case that there is hardly any gas around young blue spiral galaxies, but that old red elliptical galaxies live in a large cloud of gas\u2014of roughly the same mass as the stars themselves\u2014then that could explain the difference in the RAR between the two types.",
              "To reach a final judgement on the measured difference, one would therefore also need to measure the amounts of diffuse gas\u2014and this is exactly what is not possible using the KiDS telescopes.",
              "Other measurements have been done for a small group of around one hundred galaxies, and these measurements indeed found more gas around elliptical galaxies, but it is still unclear how representative those measurements are for the 259,000 galaxies that were studied in the current research.",
              "Dark matter for the win?",
              "If it turns out that extra gas cannot explain the difference between the two types of galaxies, then the results of the measurements are easier to understand in terms of dark matter particles than in terms of alternative models of gravity.",
              "But even then, the matter is not settled yet.",
              "While the measured differences are hard to explain using MOND, Erik Verlinde still sees a way out for his own model.",
              "Verlinde: \"My current model only applies to static, isolated, spherical galaxies, so it cannot be expected to distinguish the different types of galaxies.",
              "I view these results as a challenge and inspiration to develop an asymmetric, dynamical version of my theory, in which galaxies with a different shape and history can have a different amount of 'apparent dark matter'.\"",
              "Therefore, even after the new measurements, the dispute between dark matter and alternative gravity theories is not settled yet.",
              "Still, the new results are a major step forward: if the measured difference in gravity between the two types of galaxies is correct, then the ultimate model, whichever one that is, will have to be precise enough to explain this difference.",
              "This means in particular that many existing models can be discarded, which considerably thins out the landscape of possible explanations.",
              "On top of that, the new research shows that systematic measurements of the hot gas around galaxies are necessary.",
              "Edwin Valentijn formulates is as follows: \"As observational astronomers, we have reached the point where we are able to measure the extra gravity around galaxies more precisely than we can measure the amount of visible matter.",

              "Members of the collaboration have grants from several funding agencies to develop detector technology, including precise detection techniques that will work over DARWIN\u2019s much larger scales, says Baudis, a leading member of XENON and co-spokesperson for DARWIN.",
              "The project is also on Switzerland\u2019s national road map for future scientific infrastructure, and Germany\u2019s research ministry has issued funding calls specifically for DARWIN-related research;",

              "These teams have also considered building experiments that would take them to the neutrino floor, but \u201cthe goal is, of course, to have one large global xenon-based dark-matter experiment\u201d, says Baudis.",

              "Darwin\u2019s 50 tonnes would be close to the world\u2019s annual production of around 70 tonnes, meaning that \u2014 even if all 3 existing detectors combine their 25 tonnes \u2014 a future experiment would need to buy the rest in batches over several years.",
              "\u201cWe have to plan very carefully for it already now,\u201d says Baudis.",

              "They not only explain why galaxies seem to move as they do, but their existence also fits with theories in particle physics.",
              "A group of theories known as supersymmetry, devised in the 1970s to fill holes in physicists\u2019 standard model of fundamental particles and their interactions, predict a WIMP-like particle.",
              "And when particle physicists model the early Universe, they find that particles with WIMP-like properties would survive the hot soup of interactions in just enough numbers to match the dark-matter abundance observed today.",
              "But null results \u2014 from direct dark-matter detectors and from particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider \u2014 mean that, if WIMPs exist, either the likelihood that they interact with matter or their mass must be at the lowest end of initial predictions.",
              "The failure to detect WIMPs has caused the physics community to \u201cpause and reflect\u201d on their status, says Tien-Tien Yu, a physicist at the University of Oregon in Eugene.",

              "The annihilation of the dark matter particle-antiparticle pairs, however, would have continued, and the number density of dark matter particles would have begun to decrease exponentially.",
              "[7] Eventually, however, the number density would become so low that the dark matter particle and antiparticle interaction would cease, and the number of dark matter particles would remain (roughly) constant as the Universe continued to expand.",
              "[9] Particles with a larger interaction cross section would continue to annihilate for a longer period of time, and thus would have a smaller number density when the annihilation interaction ceases.",
              "Based on the current estimated abundance of dark matter in the Universe, if the dark matter particle is such a relic particle, the interaction cross section governing the particle-antiparticle annihilation can be no larger than the cross section for the weak interaction.",

              "Experiments that have placed bounds on WIMP annihilation, via the non-observation of an annihilation signal, include the Fermi-LAT gamma ray telescope[14] and the VERITAS ground-based gamma ray observatory.",
              "[15] Although the annihilation of WIMPs into Standard Model particles also predicts the production of high-energy neutrinos, their interaction rate is too low to reliably detect a dark matter signal at present.",

              "If a WIMP loses enough energy in such an interaction to fall below the local escape velocity, it would not have enough energy to escape the gravitational pull of the Sun and would remain gravitationally bound.",

              "\u201d The most advanced of these efforts is a planned experiment called DARWIN.",
              "The detector, estimated to cost between \u20ac100-million (US$116-million) and \u20ac150 million, is being developed by the international XENON collaboration, which runs one of the 3 experiments starting up this year \u2014 a 6-tonne detector called XENONnT at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory near Rome.",
              "DARWIN would contain almost ten times this volume of xenon.",

              "The project is also on Switzerland\u2019s national road map for future scientific infrastructure, and Germany\u2019s research ministry has issued funding calls specifically for DARWIN-related research;",
              "these steps suggest that the nations are likely to contribute further cash in the future.",
              "And although DARWIN does not yet formally have a home, it could end up at Gran Sasso.",
              "In April, the laboratory formally invited the collaboration to submit a conceptual design report by the end of 2021.",
              "\u201cIt tells us very clearly that the lab is very interested in hosting such an experiment,\u201d says co-spokesperson Marc Schumann, a physicist at the University of Freiburg in Germany.",

              "These teams have also considered building experiments that would take them to the neutrino floor, but \u201cthe goal is, of course, to have one large global xenon-based dark-matter experiment\u201d, says Baudis.",

              "The noble gas is difficult to obtain in large quantities owing to the energy-intensive process needed to extract it from the air and because of competing demand from electronics, lighting and space industries.",

              "Darwin\u2019s 50 tonnes would be close to the world\u2019s annual production of around 70 tonnes, meaning that \u2014 even if all 3 existing detectors combine their 25 tonnes \u2014 a future experiment would need to buy the rest in batches over several years.",

              "A 300-tonne experiment known as ARGO would likely begin operations around 2029 and could confirm any signal seen by DARWIN.",
              "WIMPS have been the focus of dozens of experiments because there is a strong theoretical case for their existence.",
              "They not only explain why galaxies seem to move as they do, but their existence also fits with theories in particle physics.",
              "A group of theories known as supersymmetry, devised in the 1970s to fill holes in physicists\u2019 standard model of fundamental particles and their interactions, predict a WIMP-like particle.",
              "And when particle physicists model the early Universe, they find that particles with WIMP-like properties would survive the hot soup of interactions in just enough numbers to match the dark-matter abundance observed today.",
              "But null results \u2014 from direct dark-matter detectors and from particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider \u2014 mean that, if WIMPs exist, either the likelihood that they interact with matter or their mass must be at the lowest end of initial predictions.",
              "The failure to detect WIMPs has caused the physics community to \u201cpause and reflect\u201d on their status, says Tien-Tien Yu, a physicist at the University of Oregon in Eugene.",
              "Many in the physics community, including Yu, are now searching for other dark-matter candidates, including through smaller, cheaper experiments.",
              "Still, WIMPs remain theoretically attractive enough to continue the decades-long hunt, says Yu.",

              "In cosmology, primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical black holes that formed soon after the Big Bang.",
              "In the inflationary era and early radiation-dominated universe, extremely dense pockets of subatomic matter may have been tightly packed to the point of gravitational collapse, creating primordial black holes without the supernova compression needed to make black holes today.",
              "Because the creation of primordial black holes would pre-date the first stars, they are not limited to the narrow mass range of stellar black holes.",
              "In 1966, Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov first proposed the existence of such black holes,[1] while the first in-depth study was conducted by Stephen Hawking in 1971.",
              "[2] However, their existence has not been proven and remains hypothetical.",
              "In September 2022, primordial black holes were proposed by some researchers to explain the unexpected very large early galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).",
              "[3][4] PBHs have long been considered possibly important if not nearly exclusive components of dark matter,[5][6][7][8] the latter perspective having been strengthened by both LIGO/Virgo interferometer gravitational wave and JWST observations.",
              "[9][10] Early constraints on PBHs as dark matter usually assumed most black holes would have similar or identical (\"monochromatic\") mass, which was disproven by LIGO/Virgo results,[11][12][13] and further suggestions that the actual black hole mass distribution is broadly platykurtic were evident from JWST observations of early large galaxies.",
              "[9][10] Depending on the model, primordial black holes could have initial masses ranging from 10\u22128 kg[14] (the so-called Planck relics) to more than thousands of solar masses.",
              "However, primordial black holes originally having mass lower than 1011 kg would not have survived to the present due to Hawking radiation, which causes complete evaporation in a time much shorter than the age of the Universe.",
              "[15] Primordial black holes are non-baryonic,[16] and as such are plausible dark matter candidates.",
              "[10][5][11][12][8][13][9] Primordial black holes are also good candidates for being the seeds of the supermassive black holes at the center of massive galaxies, as well as of intermediate-mass black holes.",
              "[17][3][4] Primordial black holes belong to the class of massive compact halo objects (MACHOs).",
              "They are naturally a good dark matter candidate: they are (nearly) collision-less and stable (if sufficiently massive), they have non-relativistic velocities, and they form very early in the history of the Universe (typically less than one second after the Big Bang).",
              "[18] Nevertheless, critics maintain that tight limits on their abundance have been set up from various astrophysical and cosmological observations, which would exclude that they contribute significantly to dark matter over most of the plausible mass range.",
              "[19] However, new research has provided for the possibility again, whereby these black holes would sit in clusters with a 30-solar-mass primordial black hole at the center.",
              "[20][21] In March 2016, one month after the announcement of the detection by Advanced LIGO/VIRGO of gravitational waves emitted by the merging of two 30 solar mass black holes (about 6\u00d71031 kg), three groups of researchers proposed independently that the detected black holes had a primordial origin.",
              "[22][23][24][25] Two of the groups found that the merging rates inferred by LIGO are consistent with a scenario in which all the dark matter is made of primordial black holes, if a non-negligible fraction of them are somehow clustered within halos such as faint dwarf galaxies or globular clusters, as expected by the standard theory of cosmic structure formation.",
              "The third group claimed that these merging rates are incompatible with an all-dark-matter scenario and that primordial black holes could only contribute to less than one percent of the total dark matter.",
              "The unexpected large mass of the black holes detected by LIGO has strongly revived interest in primordial black holes with masses in the range of 1 to 100 solar masses.",
              "It is still debated whether this range is excluded or not by other observations, such as the absence of micro-lensing of stars,[26] the cosmic microwave background anisotropies, the size of faint dwarf galaxies, and the absence of correlation between X-ray and radio sources toward the galactic center.",
              "In May 2016, Alexander Kashlinsky suggested that the observed spatial correlations in the unresolved gamma-ray and X-ray background radiations could be due to primordial black holes with similar masses, if their abundance is comparable to that of dark matter.",

              "[28] In September 2019, a report by James Unwin and Jakub Scholtz proposed the possibility of a primordial black hole (PBH) with mass 5\u201315 MEarth (Earth masses), about the diameter of a tennis ball, existing in the extended Kuiper Belt to explain the orbital anomalies that are theorized to be the result of a 9th planet in the solar system.",
              "[29][30] In October 2019, Derek Inman and Yacine Ali-Hai\u0308moud published an article in which they discovered that the nonlinear velocities that arise from the structure formation are too small to significantly affect the constraints that arise from CMB anisotropies[31] In September 2021, the NANOGrav collaboration announced that they had found a low-frequency signal that could be attributed to gravitational waves and potentially could be associated with PBHs.",
              "[32] In September 2022, primordial black holes were used to explain the unexpected very large early (high redshift) galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope.",
              "[3][4] Primordial black holes could have formed in the very early Universe (less than one second after the Big Bang) during the inflationary era, or in the very early radiation-dominated era.",
              "The essential ingredient for the formation of a primordial black hole is a fluctuation in the density of the Universe, inducing its gravitational collapse.",

              "[34] There are several mechanisms able to produce such inhomogeneities in the context of cosmic inflation (in hybrid inflation models.)",
              "Some examples include: Axion Inflation Axion inflation is a theoretical model in which the axion acts as an inflaton field and because of the time period its created at, the field is oscillating at its minimal potential energy, these oscillations are responsible for the energy density fluctuations in the early universe.",
              "[35] Reheating Reheating is the transitory process between the inflationary and hot, dense, radiation-dominated period.",
              "During this time the inflaton field decays into other particles and these particles begin to interact in order to reach thermal equillibrium.",
              "However, if this process is incomplete it creates density fluctuations and if these are big enough they could be responsible for the formation of PBH.",
              "[36] Cosmological phase transitions Cosmological phase transitions may cause inhomogeneities in different ways depending on the specific details of each transition.",
              "For example, one mechanism is concerned with the collapse of overdense regions that arise from these phase transitions, while another mechanism involves highly energetic particles that are produced in these phase transitions and then go through gravitational collapse forming PBH\u2019s.",
              "[37] The dark matter problem, proposed in 1933 by Swiss-American astronomer Fritz Zwicky, refers to the fact that scientists still don't know what form dark matter takes.",
              "PBH can solve that in a few ways.",
              "First, if PBH's accounted for all or a significant amount of the dark matter in the universe, this could explain the gravitational effects seen in galaxies and galactic clusters.",
              "Secondly, PBH's have different proposed production mechanisms. Unlike WIMPs, they can emit gravitational waves that interact with regular matter.",
              "Finally, the discovery of PBH's could explain some of the observed gravitational lensing effects that couldn't arise from ordinary matter.",
              "While evidence that primordial black holes may constitute dark matter is inconclusive as of 2023, researchers such as Bernard Carr and others are strong proponents.",
              "[9][10][38][11][12][8][13][5][39] Since primordial black holes do not necessarily have to be small (they can have any size), they may have contributed to formation of galaxies, such as those earlier than expected.",
              "[3][4] The cosmological domain wall problem, proposed in 1974 by Soviet physicist Yakov Zeldovich, discussed the formation of domain walls during phase transitions of the early universe and what could arise from their large energy densities.",
              "PBH's could serve as a solution to this problem in various ways.",
              "One explanation could be that PBH's can prevent the formation of domain walls due to them exerting gravitational forces on the surrounding matter making it clump and theoretically preventing the formation of said walls.",
              "Another explanation could be that PBH's could decay domain walls;",
              "if these were formed in the early universe before PBH's then due to gravitational interactions these could eventually collapse into PBH's.",
              "Finally, a third explanation could be that PBH's do not violate the observational constraints;",
              "if PBH's in the 1015-1016 gram mass range were to be detected then these would have the right density to make up all dark matter in the universe without violating constraints, thus the domain wall problem wouldn't arise.",
              "[40] The Cosmological monopole problem, also proposed by Yakov Zeldovich in the late 1970's, consisted of the absence of magnetic monopoles nowadays.",
              "PBH's can also serve as a solution to this problem.",
              "To start, if magnetic monopoles did exist in the early universe these could have gravitationally interacted with PBH's and been absorbed thus explaining their absence.",
              "Another explanation due to PBH's could be that PBH's would have exerted gravitational forces on matter causing it to clump and dilute the density of magnetic monopoles.",
              "[41] General relativity predicts the smallest primordial black holes would have evaporated by now, but if there were a fourth spatial dimension \u2013 as predicted by string theory \u2013 it would affect how gravity acts on small scales and \"slow down the evaporation quite substantially\".",
              "[42] In essence, the energy stored in the fourth spatial dimension as a stationary wave would bestow a significant rest mass to the object when regarded in the conventional four-dimensional space-time.",
              "This could mean there are several thousand primordial black holes in our galaxy.",
              "To test this theory, scientists will use the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which was put into orbit by NASA on June 11, 2008.",
              "If they observe specific small interference patterns within gamma-ray bursts, it could be the first indirect evidence for primordial black holes and string theory.",
              "[needs update] A variety of observations have been interpreted to place limits on the abundance and mass of primordial black holes: Lifetime, Hawking radiation and gamma-rays: One way to detect primordial black holes, or to constrain their mass and abundance, is by their Hawking radiation.",
              "Stephen Hawking theorized in 1974 that large numbers of such smaller primordial black holes might exist in the Milky Way in our galaxy's halo region.",
              "All black holes are theorized to emit Hawking radiation at a rate inversely proportional to their mass.",
              "Since this emission further decreases their mass, black holes with very small mass would experience runaway evaporation, creating a burst of radiation at the final phase, equivalent to a hydrogen bomb yielding millions of megatons of explosive force.",
              "[43] A regular black hole (of about 3 solar masses) cannot lose all of its mass within the current age of the universe (they would take about 1069 years to do so, even without any matter falling in).",
              "However, since primordial black holes are not formed by stellar core collapse, they may be of any size.",
              "A black hole with a mass of about 1011 kg would have a lifetime about equal to the age of the universe.",
              "If such low-mass black holes were created in sufficient number in the Big Bang, we should be able to observe explosions by some of those that are relatively nearby in our own Milky Way galaxy.",
              "NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope satellite, launched in June 2008, was designed in part to search for such evaporating primordial black holes.",
              "Fermi data set up the limit that less than one percent of dark matter could be made of primordial black holes with masses up to 1013 kg.",
              "Evaporating primordial black holes would have also had an impact on the Big Bang nucleosynthesis and change the abundances of light elements in the Universe.",
              "However, if theoretical Hawking radiation does not actually exist, such primordial black holes would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to detect in space due to their small size and lack of large gravitational influence.",
              "Temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background: Accretion of matter onto primordial black holes in the early Universe should lead to energy injection in the medium that affects the recombination history of the Universe.",
              "This effect induces signatures in the statistical distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies.",
              "The Planck observations of the CMB exclude that primordial black holes with masses in the range 100\u2013104 solar masses contribute importantly to the dark matter,[44] at least in the simplest conservative model.",

              "[45] The annihilation of WIMPs in the halo leads to a signal in the gamma-ray spectrum which is potentially detectable by dedicated instruments such as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.",
              "[46] In the future, new limits will be set up by various observations: None of these facilities are focused on the direct detection of PBH due to them being a theoretical phenomenon, but the information collected in each respective experiment provides secondary data which can help provide insight and constraints on the nature of PBHs.",

              "This possibility, however, may also not be likely, because primordial black holes had to form by the time the universe was just 1 second old.",
              "Even primordial black holes that formed at the last possible instant possible would be, according to the physics, only about 100,000 times as massive as the Sun, which is not really in the supermassive black hole weight class.",
              "To get the even larger black holes we see today, they\u2019d have to pull in a lot of material and grow very quickly.",

              "On the galactic scale, astronomers believe that our galaxy is surrounded by an extended and diffusive dark matter halo2,3.",
              "Microscopically, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), with typical masses around the electroweak symmetry breaking scale (\u223c100 GeV/c2), are a generic class of dark matter candidates favoured by many theories beyond the Standard Model of particle physics4, such as supersymmetry (SUSY).",

              "The signal rate depends on the local density and velocity distribution of WIMPs in the Milky Way (astrophysical inputs with non-negligible systematic uncertainties), the WIMP mass, and the interaction cross-section of the target nuclei10.",
              "Most theoretical models predict that this cross-section is smaller than 10\u221242 cm2 for nearly all possible WIMP masses, yielding an extremely low signal rate, which in turn requires an extraordinarily low background environment for detection.",

              "WIMPs can in principle scatter off electrons, but the recoil energy would be suppressed further by the electron mass and hence would require a more sensitive detection technology14.",
              "The nuclear recoil energy can be converted into thermal motion (phonons), ionization, or scintillation photons through the Coulomb field of the charged nucleus15.",
              "For example, semiconductor detectors can detect the electrons from the ionization of a heavy ion, and when operating at very low temperatures, the same detector can be used as a bolometer to measure the phonons produced by atomic collisions.",
              "Experiments that simultaneously detect two types of signals are typically more powerful in differentiating nuclear recoil signals against electron recoil backgrounds from radioactivity.",
              "Other features of the signals, such as the timing shape, can sometimes also be used for background discriminations.",
              "To compare the results from different experiments, the standard assumption is that WIMPs scatter coherently and elastically off all nucleons in the nucleus, and the interaction has neither nuclear spin nor a proton\u2013neutron dependence.",
