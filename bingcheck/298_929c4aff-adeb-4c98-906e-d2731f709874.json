    "response": "The modern Olympic Games were inspired by the ancient Olympic Games that were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century B.C. to the 4th century A.D. in honor of Zeus[^2^]. The ancient Games featured various athletic events, such as running, wrestling, boxing, chariot racing and pentathlon[^2^]. The Games were banned by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I in 393 A.D. as part of his efforts to suppress paganism[^2^].\n\nThe revival of the Olympic Games was initiated by a French aristocrat and educator named Pierre de Coubertin, who founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894[^2^]. He proposed to hold a modern version of the Games every four years in different countries, with the aim of promoting international peace and cooperation through sports[^2^]. The first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, with 280 participants from 12 nations competing in 43 events[^1^] [^3^]. Since then, the Games have grown to become the world's largest sporting event, featuring thousands of athletes from over 200 nations and regions competing in various summer and winter sports[^2^]. The Games have also faced many challenges and controversies over the years, such as boycotts, doping scandals, terrorism and political tensions[^2^].

              "In the early centuries of the ancient Olympics, the contests took place on one day, but the Games were later spread over four days, followed by a fifth devoted to the closing-ceremony presentation of prizes and a banquet for the champions.",
              "Although the Olympics ended in the late 4th century ce, they continued to attract interest.",
              "In the late 19th century, concerted efforts began to revive the Games, and in 1896 the first modern Olympics were held, in Athens.",
              "Just how far back in history organized athletic contests were held remains a matter of debate, but it is reasonably certain that they occurred in Greece almost 3,000 years ago.",
              "However ancient in origin, by the end of the 6th century bce at least four Greek sporting festivals, sometimes called \u201cclassical games,\u201d had achieved major importance: the Olympic Games, held at Olympia;",
              "the Pythian Games at Delphi;",
              "the Nemean Games at Nemea;",
              "and the Isthmian Games near Corinth.",
              "Later, similar festivals were held in nearly 150 cities as far afield as Rome, Naples, Odessus, Antioch, and Alexandria.",
              "Of all the games held throughout Greece, the Olympic Games were the most famous.",
              "Held every four years between August 6 and September 19, they occupied such an important place in Greek history that in late antiquity historians measured time by the interval between them\u2014an Olympiad.",
              "The Olympic Games, like almost all Greek games, were an intrinsic part of a religious festival.",
              "They were held in honour of Zeus at the sacred site Olympia by the city-state of Elis in the northwestern Peloponnese.",
              "The first Olympic champion listed in the records was Coroebus of Elis, a cook, who won the sprint race in 776 bce.",
              "Notions that the Olympics began much earlier than 776 bce are founded on myth, not historical evidence.",
              "According to one legend, for example, the Games were founded by Heracles, son of Zeus and Alcmene.",
              "At the meeting in 776 bce there was apparently only one event, a footrace that covered one length of the track at Olympia, but other events were added over the ensuing decades.",
              "The race, known as the stade, was about 192 metres (210 yards) long.",
              "The word stade also came to refer to the track on which the race was held and is the origin of the modern English word stadium.",
              "In 724 bce a two-length race, the diaulos, roughly similar to the 400-metre race, was included, and four years later the dolichos, a long-distance race possibly comparable to the modern 1,500- or 5,000-metre events, was added.",
              "Wrestling and the pentathlon were introduced in 708 bce.",
              "The latter was an all-around competition consisting of five events\u2014the long jump, the javelin throw, the discus throw, a footrace, and wrestling.",
              "Boxing was introduced in 688 bce and chariot racing eight years later.",
              "In 648 bce the pankration, a kind of no-holds-barred combat, was included.",
              "This brutal contest combined wrestling, boxing, and street fighting.",
              "Kicking and hitting a downed opponent were allowed;",
              "only biting and gouging (thrusting a finger or thumb into an opponent\u2019s eye) were forbidden.",
              "A contest ended when one of the fighters acknowledged defeat or was rendered unconscious.",
              "In some cases, competitors died during matches.",
              "Between 632 and 616 bce, events for boys were introduced.",
              "And from time to time further events were added, including a footrace in which athletes ran in partial armour and contests for heralds and for trumpeters.",
              "The program, however, was not nearly so varied as that of the modern Olympics.",
              "There were neither team games nor ball games, and the athletics (track and field) events were limited to the four running events and the pentathlon mentioned above.",
              "Chariot races and horse racing, which became part of the ancient Games, were held in the hippodrome south of the stadium.",
              "In most events, the athletes participated in the nude.",
              "Through the centuries, scholars have sought to explain this practice.",
              "Theories have ranged from the eccentric (to be nude in public without an erection demonstrated self-control) to the usual anthropological, religious, and social explanations, including the following: (1) nudity bespeaks a rite of passage, (2) nudity was a holdover from the days of hunting and gathering, (3) nudity had, for the Greeks, a magical power to ward off harm, and (4) public nudity was a kind of costume of the upper class.",
              "Historians have grasped at dubious theories because, in modern Western societies, which were long dominated by Jewish and Christian mores, to compete nude in public seems odd, if not scandalous.",
              "Yet ancient Greeks found nothing shameful about nudity, especially male nudity.",
              "Therefore, the many modern explanations of Greek athletic nudity are in the main unnecessary.",
              "The Olympic Games were technically restricted to freeborn Greeks.",
              "Many Greek competitors came from the Greek colonies on the Italian peninsula and in Asia Minor and Africa.",
              "Most of the participants were professionals who trained full-time for the events.",
              "These athletes earned substantial prizes for winning at many other, preliminary festivals, and, although the only prize at Olympia was a wreath or garland, an Olympic champion also received widespread adulation and often lavish benefits from his home city.",
              "Although there were no women\u2019s events in the ancient Olympics, several women appear in the official lists of Olympic victors as the owners of the stables of some victorious chariot entries.",
              "In Sparta, girls and young women did practice and compete locally.",
              "But, apart from those in Sparta, contests for young Greek women were very rare and probably limited to an annual local footrace.",
              "At Olympia, however, the Herean festival, held every four years in honour of the goddess Hera, included a race for young women, who were divided into three age groups.",
              "Yet the Herean race was not part of the Olympics (they took place at another time of the year) and probably was not instituted before the advent of the Roman Empire.",
              "Then for a brief period girls competed at a few other important athletic venues.",
              "The 2nd-century-ce traveler Pausanias wrote that women were banned from Olympia during the actual Games under penalty of death.",
              "Yet he also remarked that the law and penalty had never been invoked.",
              "His account later incongruously stated that unmarried women were allowed as Olympic spectators.",
              "Many historians believe that this inconsistency resulted from an error a later scribe introduced while copying this passage of Pausanias\u2019s text.",
              "Nonetheless, the notion that all or only married women were banned from the Games endured in popular writing on the topic, though the evidence regarding women as spectators remains unclear.",
              "While an athletic event, the Olympics often had a political aspect.",
              "Military conflicts between Greek city-states were not uncommon, and the Olympics offered a refuge from violence and promoted peace.",
              "As part of the Olympic truce (Ekecheiria), Olympia was free from warfare, and athletes participating in the festival were allowed safe passage through all the city-states.",
              "Nonetheless, the contests often became proxy battles between city-states, and it was not unusual for alliances between city-states to be announced during the festival.",
              "Greece lost its independence to Rome in the middle of the 2nd century bce, and support for the competitions at Olympia and elsewhere fell off considerably during the next century.",
              "The Romans looked on athletics with contempt: to strip naked and compete in public was degrading in their eyes.",
              "However, the Romans realized the political value of the Greek festivals, and the emperor Augustus staged games for Greek athletes in a temporary wooden stadium erected near the Circus Maximus in Rome and instituted major new athletic festivals in Italy and in Greece.",
              "The emperor Nero was also a keen patron of the festivals in Greece, but he disgraced himself and the Olympic Games when he entered a chariot race, fell off his vehicle, and then declared himself the winner anyway.",
              "Romans neither trained for nor participated in Greek athletics.",
              "Roman gladiator shows and team chariot racing were not related to the Olympic Games or to Greek athletics.",
              "The main difference between the Greek and Roman attitudes is reflected in the words each culture used to describe its festivals: for the Greeks they were contests (ago\u0304nes), while for the Romans they were games (ludi).",
              "The Greeks originally organized their festivals for the competitors, the Romans for the public.",
              "One was primarily competition, the other entertainment.",
              "The Olympic Games were finally abolished about 394 ce by the Roman emperor Theodosius I or his son because of the festival\u2019s pagan associations."

              "The name derives from Greek, combining the words pente (five) and athlon (competition).",
              "Five events were contested over one day, starting with the stadion (a short foot race), followed by the javelin throw, discus throw and long jump (the order of these three events is still unclear), and ending with wrestling.",
              "While pentathletes were considered to be inferior to the specialized athletes in a certain event, they were superior in overall development and were some of the most well balanced of all the athletes.",
              "[1] Their training was often part of military service\u2014each of the five events was thought to be useful in battle.",
              "The event was first held at the 18th Ancient Olympiad around 708 BC,[2] and changed format a number of times.",
              "By the 77th Ancient Olympiad, the pentathlon was generally ordered into three sections: the triagmos of the long jump, javelin throw, and discus throw, the stadion foot race, and wrestling as the final event.",
              "The first three events were generally not held as individual events, but rather as only part of pentathlon competitions.",
              "[3] The wide variety of skills needed to compete led Aristotle to hold pentathletes in high esteem as physical specimens.",
              "[4] In the Rhetoric, he made the following remark: \"Beauty varies with each age.",
              "In a young man, it consists in possessing a body capable of enduring all efforts, either of the racecourse or of bodily strength, while he himself is pleasant to look upon and a sheer delight.",
              "This is why the athletes in the pentathlon are most beautiful, because they are naturally adapted for bodily exertion and for swiftness of foot\" (Rhetoric 1361b11).",
              "Every four years when Olympic games occurred, there was the \"Olympic truce\".",
              "This was an agreement that all the city states agreed on.",
              "At this time there was an organized truce between all the cities involved in the games.",
              "This was done to give families and people the safety needed to travel long distance to the games.",
              "This truce was known as \"Ekecheiria\".",
              "[5] The long jump is perhaps the most unusual, compared to the modern athletics version.",
              "A long jumper used weights called halteres to propel himself farther out of standing, and his jump probably consisted of five separate leaps, more like the modern triple jump;",
              "otherwise, distances of known jumps (which are often as far as 50 feet) would seem to be impossible.",
              "The javelin, like the discus, was thrown for length, but in addition there was a second section of it where they threw for accuracy.",
              "The javelin was a lighter, longer version of a war spear.",
              "The \"ekebolon\" was the event won by distance.",

              "[6] The javelin throw used a leather strap, called an amentum, rather than having the athlete grip the shaft of the javelin itself.",
              "Competitors in the javelin and discus throws were allowed five throws each, and only their longest throw would count.",
              "The long jump was also attempted five times.",

              "Wrestling was the fifth and last event of the pentathlon.",

              "More than that, they were the first culture in which people idolized their favorite athletic superstars, to a level that even today\u2019s most fanatical sports fans might find extreme.",
              "\u201cThe Greeks believed that athletes had special powers,\u201d explains David Lunt, an associate professor of history at Southern Utah University who is an expert on ancient Greek athletics and author of The Crown Games of Ancient Greece: Archaeology, Athletes and Heroes.",
              "\u201cThey commissioned poems to be sung about them, and they told stories about statues of athletes that could heal people.\"",
              "Lunt cites the example of Theagenes of Thasos, a champion boxer, runner and competitor in Pankration, the ancient equivalent of mixed martial arts, who was so idolized for his athletic prowess that archaeologists in the 1930s found an altar at which he was venerated, centuries after his death.",
              "As Lunt says, \u201cThey were pretty crazy for these athletes.",
              "\u201d The ancient Greeks may have loved sports because males grew up participating in them.",
              "As Lunt notes, every Greek city had its own gymnasium, where local males took off their clothes and competed in the nude at various sports, such as wrestling and foot races.",
              "\u201cThe Greeks valued physical and athletic prowess, and the toned male body was sought after as aesthetically pleasing,\u201d says Zina Giannopoulou, an associate professor of classics at the University of California, Irvine who has compared the ancient and modern Olympics.",
              "\u201cPhysical strength and prowess were also signs of moral strength, denoting self-discipline, hard work, and dedication to winning.",
              "\u201d Athletes were seen as the epitome of arete, a Greek word that means virtue or excellence.",
              "The Greeks also simply loved to watch competitions.",
              "In addition to the Olympics every four years, they held games at other religious festivals\u2014the Pythian Games for Apollo at Delphi, the Isthmian Games for Poseidon and the Nemean Games, which honored Zeus.",
              "The Crown Games, as these competitions collectively were known, featured a range of events, from chariot races to track and field events and combat sports.",
              "The athletes who competed in these events most likely were well-to-do Greeks who could afford to train instead of having to work for a living.",
              "\u201cIf you wanted to compete in the Olympics, you had to show up at least a month early to train under the watch of the officials, who presumably would weed out anybody who wasn\u2019t up to the level of competition,\u201d Lunt says.",
              "The Greeks didn\u2019t have team sports, only individual competitions, and they didn\u2019t allow women to compete in events\u2014or even, in the case of married women, to attend the games.",
              "There was one legendary exception\u2014Kallipateira of Rhodes, who disguised herself as a male trainer so she could watch her son\u2019s boxing match.",

              "Chariot racing was an expensive sport to compete in, and the owners of the horses and chariots\u2014who watched as drivers competed in their name\u2014used the event to flaunt their wealth.",

              "In ancient Greek-style wrestling, grapplers fought in a standing position, with the object of throwing the opponent to the ground, according to Miller.",
              "The concept of pinning an adversary\u2019s shoulders to the ground didn\u2019t yet exist.",

              "The Greeks had lead or stone weights, called halteres, that some believe jumpers used in an effort to propel themselves further during the competition, though Lunt believes that the weights were only used in training.",
              "Unlike modern boxing, the Greeks\u2019 version had no rounds and no time limit.",
              "Instead, boxers simply fought until one man was either unable to continue or admitted that he was beaten.",
              "Like wrestling, the Greek boxers competed in a single open division, and they wore thin leather thongs called himantes around their knuckles and wrists, but no padded gloves.",
              "This sport, whose name means \u201ccomplete victory\u201d in ancient Greek, was a sort of no-holds barred version of modern mixed martial arts.",

              "They also were allowed to hit or kick opponents in the groin, something that\u2019s not allowed in MMA, and unlike modern UFC fighters, they didn\u2019t wear gloves, which allowed them to use karate-style knife hand strikes.",
              "Only biting and gouging were outlawed.",
              "According to Michael B.",
              "Poliakoff\u2019s Combat Sports in the Ancient World: Competition, Violence, and Culture, Sostratos of Sikyon won numerous crowns in competitions by bending opponents\u2019 fingers back painfully until they were in danger of breaking (another technique outlawed in MMA).",
              "Instead of the octagon, with its padded surface, competitors fought in a sand pit.",
              "The result was a bloody, brutal contest that not only tested an athlete\u2019s fighting skills, but his ability to endure pain.",

              "The persecution of pagans under Theodosius I began in 381, after the first couple of years of his reign as co-emperor in the eastern part of the Roman Empire.",
              "In the 380s, Theodosius I reiterated the ban of Constantine the Great on animal sacrifices, prohibited haruspicy on pain of death, pioneered the criminalization of magistrates who did not enforce anti-pagan laws, broke up some pagan associations and destroyed pagan temples.",
              "Between 389 and 391 he issued the \"Theodosian decrees\", which established a practical ban on paganism;",
              "[1] visits to the temples were forbidden, the remaining pagan holidays were abolished, the sacred fire in the Temple of Vesta in the Roman Forum was extinguished as the Vestal Virgins were disbanded, and auspices and witchcraft were deemed punishable offenses.",
              "Theodosius refused to restore the Altar of Victory in the Senate House, as requested by pagan Senators.",
              "In 392 he became emperor of the whole empire (the last one to be so).",
              "From this moment until the end of his reign in 395, while pagans remained outspoken in their demands for toleration,[2][3] he authorized or participated in the destruction of many temples, holy sites, images and objects of piety throughout the empire[4][5][6][page needed][7][page needed][8] in actions by Christians against major pagan sites.",
              "[9] He issued a comprehensive law that prohibited any public pagan ritual[10] and was particularly oppressive of Manicheans.",
              "[11] He is likely to have suppressed the Ancient Olympic Games, whose last record of celebration is 393.",
              "[12] Theodosius I was relatively tolerant towards pagans in the early part of his reign,[13][14] since he needed the support of the influential pagan ruling class and the percentage of non-Christians in the general population was still quite large, perhaps 50% overall.",
              "This was especially true in the West, where the Church was still largely an urban phenomenon except in North Africa.",
              "He voiced his support for the preservation of temples or pagan statues as useful public buildings.",
              "He is known to have appointed various pagans to office in the earlier part of his reign.",
              "For example, he appointed the pagan Eutolmius Tatianus as the praetorian prefect of Egypt.",
              "[15] Theodosius I's relative tolerance for other religions is also indicated by his later order (in 388) for the reconstruction of a Jewish synagogue at Callinicum in Mesopotamia, which had been destroyed by a bishop and his Christian flock.",
              "[a] Theodosius dealt harshly with Arians, heretics and Christian apostates.",
              "[17][b] Later in his reign, he tried to stamp out the last vestiges of paganism with great severity.",
              "[20] However, he did not succeed in this.",
              "Even though deprived of State and municipal support, bereft of funds and property the followers of the old religions continued to survive visibly, though under pressure and weakening, into the early 6th century.",
              "[citation needed] His first attempt to inhibit paganism was in 381 when he reiterated Constantine's ban on sacrifice.",
              "In 384 he prohibited haruspicy on pain of death, and unlike earlier anti-pagan prohibitions, he made non-enforcement of the law by magistrates a crime.",
              "Both Theodosius and Valentinian II formally recognized Maximus in 384.",
              "For a time, the pagans enjoyed religious liberty once again, and many distinguished pagans rose to important offices in the state.",
              "[c] The fact that the temples continued to be cared for and that pagan festivals continued to be celebrated is indicated by a law of 386, which declared that care for the temples and festivals were the exclusive prerogative of the pagans.",
              "[21] This law also confirms the right of the priests to perform the traditional pagan rites of the temples.",
              "In 387, Theodosius declared war on Maximus after Maximus had driven Valentinian II out of Italy.",
              "Maximus was defeated and executed, and the anti-pagan regulations of Gratian were apparently reinstated by Valentinian II.",
              "In 388 Theodosius sent a prefect to Syria, Egypt, and Asia Minor with the aim of breaking up pagan associations and the destruction of their temples.",
              "The Serapeum of Alexandria was destroyed during this campaign.",
              "[22] In a series of decrees called the \"Theodosian decrees\" he progressively declared that those pagan feasts that had not yet been rendered Christian ones were now to be workdays (in 389).",

              "[27] The ancestral religious rites were once again performed openly and the Altar of Victory was restored.",
              "[28] The temples that were thus closed could be declared \"abandoned\", as Bishop Theophilus I of Alexandria immediately noted in applying for permission to demolish a site and cover it with a Christian church, an act that must have received general sanction, for mithraea forming crypts of churches, and temples forming the foundations of 5th century churches appear throughout the former Roman Empire.",

              "while a few feet away stood the archbishop of Athens, and Pe\u0300re Didon, the celebrated Dominican preacher, who, in his Easter sermon in the Catholic cathedral the day before, had paid an eloquent tribute to pagan Greece.",
              "De Coubertin highlights a problem: for centuries newspapers, periodicals, and literature had propagated the belief that pagan practices, including the Olympics, had rightly been stamped out by the rise and spread of Christianity.",
              "Yet the modern Olympic founder was taking pleasure not only in the fact that the games had been revived but also that a Dominican preacher (who was, incidentally, also the inventor of the Olympic motto) had paid tribute to pagan Greece.",

              "However critically Greek and Roman paganism were viewed, the status of Classical Greece as the home of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle had always confirmed its place at the centre of European education.",
              "For physical educationalists such as de Coubertin, nothing topped the pinnacle of the Olympic Games, Greece\u2019s oldest and most popular sporting event.",
              "The key was to adapt the games to \u201cthe needs and taste of the age\u201d.",
              "This meant no more trappings of religious cult.",
              "Thus, when Pe\u0300re Didon praised \u201cpagan Greece\u201d, it was as the home of \u201cbeauty, grace, and strength all in one\u201d (de Coubertin\u2019s words);",
              "the perfect, philosophical place to educate the energetic youth of any era.",
              "Ultimately, the blame for ending the Olympic Games was laid at the feet of Theodosius I because it was difficult for people to believe that the festival \u2013 a defining cultural symbol of antiquity \u2013 simply fizzled out after more than a thousand years.",
              "The conflict between paganism and Christianity in the later Roman empire became an easy way of explaining the end of this great athletic contest.",
              "By the time de Coubertin came to revive the Olympics in the 19th century, this story was set in stone.",
              "In restaging the games in a modern world, he drew inspiration from the athleticism of the Classical Greeks, but left the pagan rituals of the ancient world far behind.",

              "Coubertin\u2019s extraordinary energies, his taste for cultural symbolism, his social and political connections, and his willingness to exhaust his fortune in pursuit of his ambitions were critical to launching the Olympic movement.",
              "At the 1889 Universal Exhibition in Paris, Coubertin launched a series of congresses on physical education and international sport that coincided with inspiring new archaeological finds from Olympia.",

              "Pierre de Fre\u0301dy was born in Paris on 1 January 1863, into an aristocratic family.",
              "[3] He was the fourth child of Baron Charles Louis de Fre\u0301dy, Baron de Coubertin and Marie\u2013Marcelle Gigault de Crisenoy.",
              "[4] Family tradition held that the Fre\u0301dy name had first arrived in France in the early 15th century, and the first recorded title of nobility granted to the family was given by Louis XI to an ancestor, also named Pierre de Fre\u0301dy, in 1477 but other branches of his family tree delved even further into French history, and the annals of both sides of his family included nobles of various stations, military leaders and associates of kings and princes of France.",
              "[5] His father Charles was a staunch royalist and accomplished artist whose paintings were displayed and given prizes at the Parisian salon, at least in those years when he was not absent in protest of the rise to power of Louis Napoleon.",
              "His paintings often centered on themes related to the Roman Catholic Church, classicism, and nobility, which reflected those things he thought most important.",
              "[6] In a later semi-fictional autobiographical piece called Le Roman d'un rallie\u0301, Coubertin describes his relationship with both his mother and his father as having been somewhat strained during his childhood and adolescence.",
              "His memoirs elaborated further, describing as a pivotal moment his disappointment upon meeting Henri, Count of Chambord, whom the elder Coubertin believed to be the rightful king.",
              "[7] Coubertin grew up in a time of profound change in France: defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the Paris Commune, and the establishment of the Third Republic[8] but while these events were the setting of his childhood, his school experiences were just as formative.",
              "In October 1874, his parents enrolled him in a new Jesuit school called Externat de la rue de Vienne, which was still under construction for his first five years there.",
              "While many of the school's attendees were day students, Coubertin boarded at the school under the supervision of a Jesuit priest, which his parents hoped would instill him with a strong moral and religious education.",
              "[9] There, he was among the top three students in his class, and was an officer of the school's elite academy made up of its best and brightest.",
              "This suggests that despite his rebelliousness at home, Coubertin adapted well to the strict rigors of a Jesuit education.",
              "[10] As an aristocrat, Coubertin had a number of career paths from which to choose, including potentially prominent roles in the military or politics but he chose instead to pursue a career as an intellectual, studying and later writing on a broad range of topics, including education, history, literature and sociology.",
              "[3] The subject which he seems to have been most deeply interested in was education, and his study focused in particular on physical education and the role of sport in schooling.",
              "In 1883, at the age of twenty, he visited England for the first time, and studied the program of physical education instituted under Thomas Arnold at the Rugby School.",
              "Coubertin credited these methods with leading to the expansion of British power during the 19th century and advocated their use in French institutions.",
              "The inclusion of physical education in the curriculum of French schools would become an ongoing pursuit and passion of Coubertin's.",
              "[3] Coubertin is thought to have exaggerated the importance of sport to Thomas Arnold, whom he viewed as \"one of the founders of athletic chivalry\".",
              "The character-reforming influence of sport with which Coubertin was so impressed is more likely to have originated in the novel Tom Brown's School Days (published in 1857) rather than exclusively in the ideas of Arnold himself.",
              "Nonetheless, Coubertin was an enthusiast in need of a cause and he found it in England and in Thomas Arnold.",
              "[11] \"Thomas Arnold, the leader and classic model of English educators,\" wrote Coubertin, \"gave the precise formula for the role of athletics in education.",
              "The cause was quickly won.",
              "Playing fields sprang up all over England\".",
              "[12] He visited other English schools to see for himself.",
              "He described the results in a book, L'Education en Angleterre, which was published in Paris in 1888.",
              "The hero of his book is Thomas Arnold, and on his second visit in 1886, Coubertin reflected on Arnold's influence in the chapel at Rugby School.",
              "[13] What Coubertin saw on the playing fields of the English schools he visited was how \"organised sport can create moral and social strength\".",
              "[14] Not only did organized games help to set the mind and body in equilibrium, it also prevented the time being wasted in other ways.",
              "First developed by the ancient Greeks, it was an approach to education that he felt the rest of the world had forgotten and to whose revival he was to dedicate the rest of his life.",
              "As a historian and a thinker on education, Coubertin romanticized ancient Greece.",
              "Thus, when he began to develop his theory of physical education, he naturally looked to the example set by the Athenian idea of the gymnasium, a training facility that simultaneously encouraged physical and intellectual development.",
              "He saw in these gymnasia what he called a triple unity between old and young, between disciplines, and between different types of people, meaning between those whose work was theoretical and those whose work was practical.",
              "Coubertin advocated for these concepts, this triple unity, to be incorporated into schools.",
              "[15] While Coubertin was certainly a romantic, and while his idealized vision of ancient Greece would lead him later to the idea of reviving the Olympic Games, his advocacy for physical education was also based on practical concerns.",
              "He believed that men who received physical education would be better prepared to fight in wars, and better able to win conflicts like the Franco-Prussian War, in which France had been humiliated.",
              "He also saw sport as democratic, in that sports competition crossed class lines, although it did so without causing a mingling of classes, which he did not support.",
              "[15] Unfortunately for Coubertin, his efforts to incorporate more physical education into French schools failed.",
              "The failure of this endeavor, however, was closely followed by the development of a new idea, the revival of the ancient Olympic Games, the creation of a festival of international athleticism.",
              "[15] He was the referee of the first-ever French championship rugby union final on 20 March 1892, between Racing Club de France and Stade Franc\u0327ais.",
              "[16] Thomas Arnold, the head master of Rugby School, was an important influence on Coubertin's thoughts about education, but his meetings with William Penny Brookes also influenced his thinking about athletic competition to some extent.",
              "A trained physician, Brookes believed that the best way to prevent illness was through physical exercise.",
              "In 1850, he had initiated a local athletic competition that he referred to as \"Meetings of the Olympian Class\"[17] at the Gaskell recreation ground at Much Wenlock, Shropshire.",
              "[18] Along with the Liverpool Athletic Club, who began holding their own Olympic Festival in the 1860s, Brookes created a National Olympian Association which aimed to encourage such local competition in cities across Britain.",
              "These efforts were largely ignored by the British sporting establishment.",
              "Brookes also maintained communication with the government and sporting advocates in Greece, seeking a revival of the Olympic Games internationally under the auspices of the Greek government.",
              "[19] There, the philanthropist cousins Evangelos and Konstantinos Zappas had used their wealth to fund Olympics within Greece, and paid for the restoration of the Panathinaiko Stadium that was later used during the 1896 Summer Olympics.",
              "[20] The efforts of Brookes to encourage the internationalization of these games came to naught in his own lifetime before his death in 1895.",
              "[19] However, Brookes did organize a national Olympic Games in London, at Crystal Palace, in 1866 and this was the first Olympics to resemble an Olympic Games to be held outside of Greece[21] but while others had created Olympic contests within their countries, and broached the idea of international competition, it was Coubertin whose work would lead to the establishment of the International Olympic Committee and the organization of the first modern Olympic Games.",
              "[20] In 1888, Coubertin founded the Comite\u0301 pour la Propagation des Exercises Physiques more well known as the Comite\u0301 Jules Simon.",
              "Coubertin's earliest reference to the modern notion of Olympic Games criticizes the idea.",
              "[22] The idea for reviving the Olympic Games as an international competition came to Coubertin in 1889, apparently independently of Brookes, and he spent the following five years organizing an international meeting of athletes and sports enthusiasts that might make it happen.",
              "[15] In response to a newspaper appeal, Brookes wrote to Coubertin in 1890, and the two began an exchange of letters on education and sport.",
              "Although he was too old to attend the 1894 Congress, Brookes would continue to support Coubertin's efforts, most importantly by using his connections with the Greek government to seek its support in the endeavour.",
              "While Brookes' contribution to the revival of the Olympic Games was recognized in Britain at the time, Coubertin in his later writings largely neglected to mention the role the Englishman played in their development.",
              "[23] He did mention the roles of Evangelis Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas, but drew a distinction between their founding of athletic Olympics and his own role in the creation of an international contest.",
              "[20] However, Coubertin together with A.",
              "Mercatis, a close friend of Konstantinos, encouraged the Greek government to utilise part of Konstantinos' legacy to fund the 1896 Athens Olympic Games separately and in addition to the legacy of Evangelis Zappas that Konstantinos had been executor of.",
              "[24][25][26] Moreover, George Averoff was invited by the Greek government to fund the second refurbishment of the Panathinaiko Stadium that had already been fully funded by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier.",
              "[27] Coubertin's advocacy for the games centered on a number of ideals about sport.",
              "He believed that the early ancient Olympics encouraged competition among amateur rather than professional athletes, and saw value in that.",
              "The ancient practice of a sacred truce in association with the Games might have modern implications, giving the Olympics a role in promoting peace.",
              "This role was reinforced in Coubertin's mind by the tendency of athletic competition to promote understanding across cultures, thereby lessening the dangers of war.",
              "In addition, he saw the games as important in advocating his philosophical ideal for athletic competition: that the competition itself, the struggle to overcome one's opponent, was more important than winning.",
              "[28] Coubertin expressed this ideal thus: L'important dans la vie ce n'est point le triomphe, mais le combat, l'essentiel ce n'est pas d'avoir vaincu mais de s'e\u0302tre bien battu.",
              "The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.",
              "As Coubertin prepared for his Congress, he continued to develop a philosophy of the Olympic Games.",
              "While he certainly intended the Games to be a forum for competition between amateur athletes, his conception of amateurism was complex.",
              "By 1894, the year the Congress was held, he publicly criticized the type of amateur competition embodied in English rowing contests, arguing that its specific exclusion of working-class athletes was wrong.",
              "While he believed that athletes should not be paid to be such, he did think that compensation was in order for the time when athletes were competing and would otherwise have been earning money.",
              "Following the establishment of a definition for an amateur athlete at the 1894 Congress, he would continue to argue that this definition should be amended as necessary, and as late as 1909 would argue that the Olympic movement should develop its definition of amateurism gradually.",
              "[29] Along with the development of an Olympic philosophy, Coubertin invested time in the creation and development of a national association to coordinate athletics in France, the Union des Socie\u0301te\u0301s Franc\u0327aises de Sports Athle\u0301tiques (USFSA).",
              "In 1889, French athletics associations had grouped together for the first time and Coubertin founded a monthly magazine La Revue Athletique, the first French periodical devoted exclusively to athletics[30] and modelled on The Athlete, an English journal established around 1862.",
              "[31] Formed by seven sporting societies with approximately 800 members, by 1892 the association had expanded to 62 societies with 7,000 members.",
              "[32] That November, at the annual meeting of the USFSA, Coubertin first publicly suggested the idea of reviving the Olympics.",
              "His speech met general applause, but little commitment to the Olympic ideal he was advocating for, perhaps because sporting associations and their members tended to focus on their own area of expertise and had little identity as sportspeople in a general sense.",
              "This disappointing result was prelude to a number of challenges he would face in organizing his international conference.",
              "In order to develop support for the conference, he began to play down its role in reviving Olympic Games and instead promoted it as a conference on amateurism in sport which, he thought, was slowly being eroded by betting and sponsorships.",
              "This led to later suggestions that participants were convinced to attend under false pretenses.",
              "Little interest was expressed by those he spoke to during trips to the United States in 1893 and London in 1894, and an attempt to involve the Germans angered French gymnasts who did not want the Germans invited at all.",
              "Despite these challenges, the USFSA continued its planning for the games, adopting in its first program for the meeting eight articles to address, only one of which had to do with the Olympics.",
              "A later program would give the Olympics a much more prominent role in the meeting.",
              "[33] The congress was held on 23 June 1894 at the Sorbonne in Paris.",
              "Once there, participants divided the congress into two commissions, one on amateurism and the other on reviving the Olympics.",
              "A Greek participant, Demetrios Vikelas, was appointed to head the commission on the Olympics, and would later become the first President of the International Olympic Committee.",
              "Along with Coubertin, C.",

              "Sloane of the United States helped lead the efforts of the commission.",
              "In its report, the commission proposed that Olympic Games be held every four years and that the program for the Games be one of modern rather than ancient sports.",
              "They also set the date and location for the first modern Olympic Games, the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, and the second, the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris.",
              "Coubertin had originally opposed the choice of Greece, as he had concerns about the ability of a weakened Greek state to host the competition, but was convinced by Vikelas to support the idea.",
              "The commission's proposals were accepted unanimously by the congress, and the modern Olympic movement was officially born.",
              "The proposals of the other commission, on amateurism, were more contentious, but this commission also set important precedents for the Olympic Games, specifically the use of heats to narrow participants and the banning of prize money in most contests.",
              "[34] Following the Congress, the institutions created there began to be formalized into the International Olympic Committee (IOC), with Demetrios Vikelas as its first president.",
              "The work of the IOC increasingly focused on the planning the 1896 Athens Games, and de Coubertin played a background role as Greek authorities took the lead in logistical organization of the Games in Greece itself, offering technical advice such as a sketch of a design of a velodrome to be used in cycling competitions.",
              "He also took the lead in planning the program of events, although to his disappointment, polo, football, or boxing were not included in 1896.",
              "[35] The Greek organizing committee had been informed that four foreign football teams had entered, however none of them showed up in Athens, and despite Greek preparations for a football tournament it was cancelled during the Games.",
              "[36] The Greek authorities were also frustrated that he could not provide an exact estimate of the number of attendees more than a year in advance.",
              "In France, Coubertin's efforts to elicit interest in the Games among athletes and the press met difficulty, largely because the participation of German athletes angered French nationalists who begrudged Germany their victory in the Franco-Prussian War.",
              "Germany also threatened not to participate after rumors spread that Coubertin had sworn to keep Germany out, but following a letter to the Kaiser denying the accusation, the German National Olympic Committee decided to attend.",
              "Coubertin himself was frustrated by the Greeks, who increasingly ignored him in their planning and who wanted to continue to hold the Games in Athens every four years, against de Coubertin's wishes.",
              "The conflict was resolved after he suggested to the King of Greece that he hold pan-Hellenic games in between Olympiads, an idea which the King accepted, although Coubertin would receive some angry correspondence even after the compromise was reached and the King did not mention him at all during the banquet held in honor of foreign athletes during the 1896 Games.",
              "[37] Coubertin took over the IOC presidency when Demetrios Vikelas stepped down after the Olympics in his own country.",
              "Despite the initial success, the Olympic movement faced hard times, as the 1900 Games (in De Coubertin's own Paris) and 1904 Games were both overshadowed by World's Fairs in the same cities, and received little attention.",

              "He was succeeded as president, in 1925, by Belgian Henri de Baillet-Latour.",
              "Years later Coubertin came out of retirement to lend his prestige to assisting Berlin to land the 1936 games.",

              "[53] Further, Young asserts that the effort to limit international competition to amateur athletes, which Coubertin was a part of, was in fact part of efforts to give the upper classes greater control over athletic competition, removing such control from the working classes.",

              "As a republican born to the French aristocracy, a patriot with an internationalist\u2019s outlook, and a child of the French defeats of 1871 yet a committed progressive and optimist, Coubertin struggled in his 20s to find a satisfying vocation.",
              "Inspired by study tours of British public schools and American colleges, he resolved \u201cto attach his name to a great educational reform,\u201d embarking upon lifelong campaigns for secondary-school improvement, workers universities, and the popular study of world political history.",

              "His public call for an Olympic revival at one of these congresses in 1892 fell on deaf ears, but he persevered, and in 1894 a second Sorbonne congress resolved to hold an international Olympic Games in Athens.",

              "After the highly successful 1924 Olympics in Paris, Coubertin retired from the IOC presidency.",
              "His final years were marked by personal isolation, penury, and family tragedy, while the Games themselves, as evidenced by Los Angeles 1932 and Berlin 1936, stepped closer to the centre of world affairs.",
              "Coubertin died in Geneva in 1937 and was buried in Lausanne, save for his heart, which upon his instructions was removed from his corpse and interred in a memorial stela adjacent to the ruins of ancient Olympia."

              "He was particularly active in promoting the introduction of sport in French schools.",
              "Born into a French aristocratic family, he became an academic and studied a broad range of topics, most notably education and history.",
              "He graduated with a degree in law and public affairs from the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po).",
              "[1] It was at Sciences Po that he came up with the idea of reviving the Olympic Games.",
              "[2] The Pierre de Coubertin medal (also known as the Coubertin medal or the True Spirit of Sportsmanship medal) is an award given by the International Olympic Committee to athletes who demonstrate the spirit of sportsmanship in the Olympic Games.",
              "Pierre de Fre\u0301dy was born in Paris on 1 January 1863, into an aristocratic family.",
              "[3] He was the fourth child of Baron Charles Louis de Fre\u0301dy, Baron de Coubertin and Marie\u2013Marcelle Gigault de Crisenoy.",
              "[4] Family tradition held that the Fre\u0301dy name had first arrived in France in the early 15th century, and the first recorded title of nobility granted to the family was given by Louis XI to an ancestor, also named Pierre de Fre\u0301dy, in 1477 but other branches of his family tree delved even further into French history, and the annals of both sides of his family included nobles of various stations, military leaders and associates of kings and princes of France.",
              "[5] His father Charles was a staunch royalist and accomplished artist whose paintings were displayed and given prizes at the Parisian salon, at least in those years when he was not absent in protest of the rise to power of Louis Napoleon.",
              "His paintings often centered on themes related to the Roman Catholic Church, classicism, and nobility, which reflected those things he thought most important.",
              "[6] In a later semi-fictional autobiographical piece called Le Roman d'un rallie\u0301, Coubertin describes his relationship with both his mother and his father as having been somewhat strained during his childhood and adolescence.",
              "His memoirs elaborated further, describing as a pivotal moment his disappointment upon meeting Henri, Count of Chambord, whom the elder Coubertin believed to be the rightful king.",
              "[7] Coubertin grew up in a time of profound change in France: defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the Paris Commune, and the establishment of the Third Republic[8] but while these events were the setting of his childhood, his school experiences were just as formative.",
              "In October 1874, his parents enrolled him in a new Jesuit school called Externat de la rue de Vienne, which was still under construction for his first five years there.",
              "While many of the school's attendees were day students, Coubertin boarded at the school under the supervision of a Jesuit priest, which his parents hoped would instill him with a strong moral and religious education.",
              "[9] There, he was among the top three students in his class, and was an officer of the school's elite academy made up of its best and brightest.",
              "This suggests that despite his rebelliousness at home, Coubertin adapted well to the strict rigors of a Jesuit education.",
              "[10] As an aristocrat, Coubertin had a number of career paths from which to choose, including potentially prominent roles in the military or politics but he chose instead to pursue a career as an intellectual, studying and later writing on a broad range of topics, including education, history, literature and sociology.",
              "[3] The subject which he seems to have been most deeply interested in was education, and his study focused in particular on physical education and the role of sport in schooling.",
              "In 1883, at the age of twenty, he visited England for the first time, and studied the program of physical education instituted under Thomas Arnold at the Rugby School.",
              "Coubertin credited these methods with leading to the expansion of British power during the 19th century and advocated their use in French institutions.",
              "The inclusion of physical education in the curriculum of French schools would become an ongoing pursuit and passion of Coubertin's.",
              "[3] Coubertin is thought to have exaggerated the importance of sport to Thomas Arnold, whom he viewed as \"one of the founders of athletic chivalry\".",
              "The character-reforming influence of sport with which Coubertin was so impressed is more likely to have originated in the novel Tom Brown's School Days (published in 1857) rather than exclusively in the ideas of Arnold himself.",
              "Nonetheless, Coubertin was an enthusiast in need of a cause and he found it in England and in Thomas Arnold.",
              "[11] \"Thomas Arnold, the leader and classic model of English educators,\" wrote Coubertin, \"gave the precise formula for the role of athletics in education.",
              "The cause was quickly won.",
              "Playing fields sprang up all over England\".",
              "[12] He visited other English schools to see for himself.",
              "He described the results in a book, L'Education en Angleterre, which was published in Paris in 1888.",
              "The hero of his book is Thomas Arnold, and on his second visit in 1886, Coubertin reflected on Arnold's influence in the chapel at Rugby School.",
              "[13] What Coubertin saw on the playing fields of the English schools he visited was how \"organised sport can create moral and social strength\".",
              "[14] Not only did organized games help to set the mind and body in equilibrium, it also prevented the time being wasted in other ways.",
              "First developed by the ancient Greeks, it was an approach to education that he felt the rest of the world had forgotten and to whose revival he was to dedicate the rest of his life.",
              "As a historian and a thinker on education, Coubertin romanticized ancient Greece.",
              "Thus, when he began to develop his theory of physical education, he naturally looked to the example set by the Athenian idea of the gymnasium, a training facility that simultaneously encouraged physical and intellectual development.",
              "He saw in these gymnasia what he called a triple unity between old and young, between disciplines, and between different types of people, meaning between those whose work was theoretical and those whose work was practical.",
              "Coubertin advocated for these concepts, this triple unity, to be incorporated into schools.",
              "[15] While Coubertin was certainly a romantic, and while his idealized vision of ancient Greece would lead him later to the idea of reviving the Olympic Games, his advocacy for physical education was also based on practical concerns.",
              "He believed that men who received physical education would be better prepared to fight in wars, and better able to win conflicts like the Franco-Prussian War, in which France had been humiliated.",
              "He also saw sport as democratic, in that sports competition crossed class lines, although it did so without causing a mingling of classes, which he did not support.",
              "[15] Unfortunately for Coubertin, his efforts to incorporate more physical education into French schools failed.",
              "The failure of this endeavor, however, was closely followed by the development of a new idea, the revival of the ancient Olympic Games, the creation of a festival of international athleticism.",
              "[15] He was the referee of the first-ever French championship rugby union final on 20 March 1892, between Racing Club de France and Stade Franc\u0327ais.",
              "[16] Thomas Arnold, the head master of Rugby School, was an important influence on Coubertin's thoughts about education, but his meetings with William Penny Brookes also influenced his thinking about athletic competition to some extent.",
              "A trained physician, Brookes believed that the best way to prevent illness was through physical exercise.",
              "In 1850, he had initiated a local athletic competition that he referred to as \"Meetings of the Olympian Class\"[17] at the Gaskell recreation ground at Much Wenlock, Shropshire.",
              "[18] Along with the Liverpool Athletic Club, who began holding their own Olympic Festival in the 1860s, Brookes created a National Olympian Association which aimed to encourage such local competition in cities across Britain.",
              "These efforts were largely ignored by the British sporting establishment.",
              "Brookes also maintained communication with the government and sporting advocates in Greece, seeking a revival of the Olympic Games internationally under the auspices of the Greek government.",
              "[19] There, the philanthropist cousins Evangelos and Konstantinos Zappas had used their wealth to fund Olympics within Greece, and paid for the restoration of the Panathinaiko Stadium that was later used during the 1896 Summer Olympics.",
              "[20] The efforts of Brookes to encourage the internationalization of these games came to naught in his own lifetime before his death in 1895.",
              "[19] However, Brookes did organize a national Olympic Games in London, at Crystal Palace, in 1866 and this was the first Olympics to resemble an Olympic Games to be held outside of Greece[21] but while others had created Olympic contests within their countries, and broached the idea of international competition, it was Coubertin whose work would lead to the establishment of the International Olympic Committee and the organization of the first modern Olympic Games.",
              "[20] In 1888, Coubertin founded the Comite\u0301 pour la Propagation des Exercises Physiques more well known as the Comite\u0301 Jules Simon.",
              "Coubertin's earliest reference to the modern notion of Olympic Games criticizes the idea.",
              "[22] The idea for reviving the Olympic Games as an international competition came to Coubertin in 1889, apparently independently of Brookes, and he spent the following five years organizing an international meeting of athletes and sports enthusiasts that might make it happen.",
              "[15] In response to a newspaper appeal, Brookes wrote to Coubertin in 1890, and the two began an exchange of letters on education and sport.",
              "Although he was too old to attend the 1894 Congress, Brookes would continue to support Coubertin's efforts, most importantly by using his connections with the Greek government to seek its support in the endeavour.",
              "While Brookes' contribution to the revival of the Olympic Games was recognized in Britain at the time, Coubertin in his later writings largely neglected to mention the role the Englishman played in their development.",
              "[23] He did mention the roles of Evangelis Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas, but drew a distinction between their founding of athletic Olympics and his own role in the creation of an international contest.",
              "[20] However, Coubertin together with A.",
              "Mercatis, a close friend of Konstantinos, encouraged the Greek government to utilise part of Konstantinos' legacy to fund the 1896 Athens Olympic Games separately and in addition to the legacy of Evangelis Zappas that Konstantinos had been executor of.",
              "[24][25][26] Moreover, George Averoff was invited by the Greek government to fund the second refurbishment of the Panathinaiko Stadium that had already been fully funded by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier.",
              "[27] Coubertin's advocacy for the games centered on a number of ideals about sport.",
              "He believed that the early ancient Olympics encouraged competition among amateur rather than professional athletes, and saw value in that.",
              "The ancient practice of a sacred truce in association with the Games might have modern implications, giving the Olympics a role in promoting peace.",
              "This role was reinforced in Coubertin's mind by the tendency of athletic competition to promote understanding across cultures, thereby lessening the dangers of war.",
              "In addition, he saw the games as important in advocating his philosophical ideal for athletic competition: that the competition itself, the struggle to overcome one's opponent, was more important than winning.",
              "[28] Coubertin expressed this ideal thus: L'important dans la vie ce n'est point le triomphe, mais le combat, l'essentiel ce n'est pas d'avoir vaincu mais de s'e\u0302tre bien battu.",
              "The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.",
              "As Coubertin prepared for his Congress, he continued to develop a philosophy of the Olympic Games.",
              "While he certainly intended the Games to be a forum for competition between amateur athletes, his conception of amateurism was complex.",
              "By 1894, the year the Congress was held, he publicly criticized the type of amateur competition embodied in English rowing contests, arguing that its specific exclusion of working-class athletes was wrong.",
              "While he believed that athletes should not be paid to be such, he did think that compensation was in order for the time when athletes were competing and would otherwise have been earning money.",
              "Following the establishment of a definition for an amateur athlete at the 1894 Congress, he would continue to argue that this definition should be amended as necessary, and as late as 1909 would argue that the Olympic movement should develop its definition of amateurism gradually.",
              "[29] Along with the development of an Olympic philosophy, Coubertin invested time in the creation and development of a national association to coordinate athletics in France, the Union des Socie\u0301te\u0301s Franc\u0327aises de Sports Athle\u0301tiques (USFSA).",
              "In 1889, French athletics associations had grouped together for the first time and Coubertin founded a monthly magazine La Revue Athletique, the first French periodical devoted exclusively to athletics[30] and modelled on The Athlete, an English journal established around 1862.",
              "[31] Formed by seven sporting societies with approximately 800 members, by 1892 the association had expanded to 62 societies with 7,000 members.",
              "[32] That November, at the annual meeting of the USFSA, Coubertin first publicly suggested the idea of reviving the Olympics.",
              "His speech met general applause, but little commitment to the Olympic ideal he was advocating for, perhaps because sporting associations and their members tended to focus on their own area of expertise and had little identity as sportspeople in a general sense.",
              "This disappointing result was prelude to a number of challenges he would face in organizing his international conference.",
              "In order to develop support for the conference, he began to play down its role in reviving Olympic Games and instead promoted it as a conference on amateurism in sport which, he thought, was slowly being eroded by betting and sponsorships.",
              "This led to later suggestions that participants were convinced to attend under false pretenses.",
              "Little interest was expressed by those he spoke to during trips to the United States in 1893 and London in 1894, and an attempt to involve the Germans angered French gymnasts who did not want the Germans invited at all.",
              "Despite these challenges, the USFSA continued its planning for the games, adopting in its first program for the meeting eight articles to address, only one of which had to do with the Olympics.",
              "A later program would give the Olympics a much more prominent role in the meeting.",
              "[33] The congress was held on 23 June 1894 at the Sorbonne in Paris.",
              "Once there, participants divided the congress into two commissions, one on amateurism and the other on reviving the Olympics.",
              "A Greek participant, Demetrios Vikelas, was appointed to head the commission on the Olympics, and would later become the first President of the International Olympic Committee.",
              "Along with Coubertin, C.",
              "Herbert of Britain's Amateur Athletic Association and W.",
              "M.",
              "Sloane of the United States helped lead the efforts of the commission.",
              "In its report, the commission proposed that Olympic Games be held every four years and that the program for the Games be one of modern rather than ancient sports.",
              "They also set the date and location for the first modern Olympic Games, the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, and the second, the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris.",
              "Coubertin had originally opposed the choice of Greece, as he had concerns about the ability of a weakened Greek state to host the competition, but was convinced by Vikelas to support the idea.",
              "The commission's proposals were accepted unanimously by the congress, and the modern Olympic movement was officially born.",
              "The proposals of the other commission, on amateurism, were more contentious, but this commission also set important precedents for the Olympic Games, specifically the use of heats to narrow participants and the banning of prize money in most contests.",
              "[34] Following the Congress, the institutions created there began to be formalized into the International Olympic Committee (IOC), with Demetrios Vikelas as its first president.",
              "The work of the IOC increasingly focused on the planning the 1896 Athens Games, and de Coubertin played a background role as Greek authorities took the lead in logistical organization of the Games in Greece itself, offering technical advice such as a sketch of a design of a velodrome to be used in cycling competitions.",
              "He also took the lead in planning the program of events, although to his disappointment, polo, football, or boxing were not included in 1896.",
              "[35] The Greek organizing committee had been informed that four foreign football teams had entered, however none of them showed up in Athens, and despite Greek preparations for a football tournament it was cancelled during the Games.",
              "[36] The Greek authorities were also frustrated that he could not provide an exact estimate of the number of attendees more than a year in advance.",
              "In France, Coubertin's efforts to elicit interest in the Games among athletes and the press met difficulty, largely because the participation of German athletes angered French nationalists who begrudged Germany their victory in the Franco-Prussian War.",
              "Germany also threatened not to participate after rumors spread that Coubertin had sworn to keep Germany out, but following a letter to the Kaiser denying the accusation, the German National Olympic Committee decided to attend.",
              "Coubertin himself was frustrated by the Greeks, who increasingly ignored him in their planning and who wanted to continue to hold the Games in Athens every four years, against de Coubertin's wishes.",
              "The conflict was resolved after he suggested to the King of Greece that he hold pan-Hellenic games in between Olympiads, an idea which the King accepted, although Coubertin would receive some angry correspondence even after the compromise was reached and the King did not mention him at all during the banquet held in honor of foreign athletes during the 1896 Games.",

              "London 2012 had a cost overrun of 76%, Sochi 2014 of 289%.",
              "[71] It has been documented that cost and cost overrun for the Games follow a power-law distribution, which means that, first, the Games are prone to large cost overruns and, second, it is only a matter of time until an overrun occurs that is larger than the largest to date.",
              "In short, hosting the Games is economically and financially extremely risky.",
              "[74] Seeking a scholarly institution to independently research the Games, Bob Barney led efforts to establish the International Centre for Olympic Studies in 1989, endeavouring to write about sociocultural impacts of the Olympic Games.",
              "[75][76] He felt that the Olympics \"is worthy of study because it is one of the biggest meetings in a global context and has many political, economic, and other problems associated with it\".",
              "[75] He began Olympika in 1992, the first peer-reviewed academic journal focused on the Olympic Games.",
              "[77][78] The International Society of Olympic Historians was founded in 1991, which publishes the Journal of Olympic History.",
              "[79] Is a common point for many economists as they are sceptical about the economic benefits of hosting the Olympic Games, emphasising that such \"mega-events\" often have large costs while yielding relatively few tangible benefits in the long run.",
              "[80] Conversely hosting (or even bidding for) the Olympics appears to increase the host country's exports, as the host or candidate country sends a signal about trade openness when bidding to host the Games.",
              "[81] Moreover, research suggests that hosting the Summer Olympics has a strong positive effect on the philanthropic contributions of corporations headquartered in the host city, which seems to benefit the local nonprofit sector.",
              "This positive effect begins in the years leading up to the Games and might persist for several years afterwards, although not permanently.",
              "This finding suggests that hosting the Olympics might create opportunities for cities to influence local corporations in ways that benefit the local nonprofit sector and civil society.",
              "[82] The Games have also had significant negative effects on host communities;",
              "for example, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions reports that the Olympics displaced more than two million people over two decades, often disproportionately affecting disadvantaged groups.",
              "[83] The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were the most expensive Olympic Games in history, costing in excess of US$50 billion.",
              "According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that was released at the time of the games, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but could attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.",
              "[84] But by December 2014,eight months after the games endThe Guardian stated that Sochi \"now feels like a ghost town\", citing the spread-out nature of the stadiums and arenas, the still-unfinished infrastructure, and the overall effects of Russia's political and economic turmoil.",
              "[85] Furthermore, at least four cities withdrew their bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics, citing the high costs or the lack of local support,[86] resulting in only a two-city race between Almaty, Kazakhstan and Beijing, China who hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics.",
              "Thus,some weeks before the 2016 Summer Olympics, The Guardian stated that the biggest threat to the future of the Olympics is that very few cities or countries want to host them.",
              "[87] Bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics also became a two-city race between Paris and Los Angeles, so the IOC took the unusual step of simultaneously awarding both the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles.",
              "Both of the bids were praised for high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities.",
              "[88] The Olympic Movement encompasses a large number of national and international sporting organisations and federations, recognised media partners, as well as athletes, officials, judges, and every other person and institution that agrees to abide by the rules of the Olympic Charter.",
              "[89] As the umbrella organisation of the Olympic Movement, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is responsible for selecting the host city, overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games, updating and approving the Olympic sports programme, and negotiating sponsorship and broadcasting rights.",
              "[90] The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements: French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement.",
              "The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country (or languages, if a country has more than one official language apart from French or English).",
              "Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these three (or more) languages, or the main two depending on whether the host country is an English or French speaking country: French is always spoken first, followed by an English translation, and then the dominant language of the host nation (when this is not English or French).",
              "[95] The IOC has often been accused of being an intractable organisation, with several life members on the committee.",
              "The presidential terms of Avery Brundage and Juan Antonio Samaranch were especially controversial.",
              "Brundage fought strongly for amateurism and against the commercialisation of the Olympic Games, even as these attitudes came to be seen as incongruous with the realities of modern sports.",
              "The advent of state-sponsored athletes from the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it placed self-financed amateurs of Western countries at a disadvantage.",
              "[96] Brundage was accused of racism\u2014for resisting the exclusion of apartheid South Africa\u2014and antisemitism.",
              "[97] Under the Samaranch presidency, the office was accused of both nepotism and corruption.",
              "[98] Samaranch's ties with the Franco regime in Spain were also a source of criticism.",

              "As a result of the investigation, ten members of the IOC were expelled and a further ten sanctioned.",
              "[100] Stricter rules were adopted for future bids, and caps were introduced to define how much IOC members could accept from bid cities.",
              "Additionally, new term and age limits were put into place for IOC membership, and fifteen former Olympic athletes were added to the committee.",

              "records were set in both the broadcasting and marketing programs. Over 2 billion viewers watched more than 13 billion viewer-hours.",
              "[101] The 2002 Games were also a financial success, raising more money with fewer sponsors than any prior Olympic Games, leaving SLOC with a surplus of $40 million.",

              "[104] He later noted that when the spotlight is on the athletes, it has \"the power to eclipse impressions of scandal or corruption\", with respect to the Olympic bid process.",
