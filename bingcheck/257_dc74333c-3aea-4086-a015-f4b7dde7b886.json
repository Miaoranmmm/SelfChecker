    "query": "What is the most effective method for preventing cyber attacks on personal devices and online accounts, and what proactive measures can individuals take to protect themselves from potential security breaches?",
    "response": "Cyber attacks on personal devices and online accounts can have serious consequences, such as identity theft, financial loss, data corruption, or privacy breach. Therefore, it is important to take proactive measures to protect yourself from potential security threats. Here are some of the most effective methods for preventing cyber attacks, based on the web search results[^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^] [^6^]:\n\n- Use an antivirus software and keep it updated. Antivirus software can protect your devices from various kinds of malware, such as ransomware, trojans, bots, etc. You should also enable automatic updates for your operating system and applications, as they can fix security vulnerabilities and bugs.\n- Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication. Strong passwords are hard to guess and should have at least eight characters, a combination of letters, numbers and special characters. You should also use a different password for each account and change them regularly. Multifactor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second piece of information to verify your identity, such as a code sent to your phone or a biometric scan.\n- Think before you click. Phishing emails are one of the most common ways that hackers try to trick you into revealing your personal or financial information, or installing malicious software on your device. You should always check the sender's address, the subject line, the spelling and grammar, and the links before opening or responding to any email. If you are not sure about an email, delete it or report it as spam.\n- Use a secure internet connection and Wi-Fi network. When you are online, you should avoid using public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks, as they can expose your data to hackers or eavesdroppers. You should also use a VPN (virtual private network) service to encrypt your internet traffic and hide your online activity from prying eyes. Additionally, you should use a firewall and disable file sharing on your device to prevent unauthorized access.\n- Don't share your personal or financial information online. You should be careful about what you post on social media, online forums, or other websites, as hackers can use this information to impersonate you or target you with scams. You should also avoid saving your credit card information on online stores or using unsafe payment options when shopping online. Furthermore, you should check your account statements and credit reports regularly to detect any suspicious activity or fraud.\n\nThese are some of the basic steps you can take to keep yourself cyber safe. However, there is no foolproof way to prevent cyber attacks completely, so you should always be vigilant and cautious when using the internet.",

Such lists include the numerous online dictionaries for various human languages, breached databases of plaintext and hashed passwords from various online business and social accounts, along with other common passwords.",

              "Unfortunately, many authentication systems in common use do not employ salts and rainbow tables are available on the Internet for several such systems. Password strength is specified by the amount of information entropy, which is measured in shannon (Sh) and is a concept from information theory.",

              "Under the traditional approach to password construction, users are asked to generate highly complex and difficult-to-guess passwords.",
              "These passwords must be reset on a regular schedule, and restrictions generally prevent users from consecutively recycling passwords.",
              "Users are also instructed to refrain from using the same or similar passwords on multiple IT systems. As all users know, this makes remembering passwords very difficult.",

              "They need only ensure that their password or passphrase is of sufficient length and does not appear in a dictionary of prohibited passwords.",
              "Users will also appreciate not having to change their password on a predefined schedule.",

              "8 Correspondingly, the new NIST guidelines recommend password resets only in cases where there is a suspected threat rather than forcing resets on a set schedule.",
              "While the updated guidelines make secure password practices easier for users in a number of ways, they also introduce potential problems and pain points.",

              "12 NIST now recommends that systems be configured to allow phrases of at least 64 characters or more and to accept expanded sets of character types including spaces, punctuation and even nonstandard characters such as emojis (where feasible) to encourage stronger passwords without enforcing unwieldy complexity rules.",

              "13 While the new guidelines offer significant advantages, security professionals should carefully consider the tradeoffs that come with implementing these guidelines and not expect an easy solution for secure authentication.",
              "For instance, much of the improved security in the NIST SP 800-63-3 guidelines comes from making it easier for users to adopt longer passwords, but they are not actually required to change their normal password behavior.",
              "An individual could create a simple password as short as eight alpha (or numeric) characters.",
              "If the password is not restricted by the prohibited password list, the user could conceivably select a password that is simpler to crack than would otherwise be possible under traditional complexity rules.",
              "The prohibited password dictionary is central to the improved security provided by the NIST guidelines and deserves special attention from security professionals.",
              "An important consideration is that NIST does not prescribe a particular bad password list, so implementers must adopt or develop and maintain their own.",
              "There are open-source repositories of compromised and commonly used passwords such as \u201cSecLists\u201d on Github,14 in addition to a number of commercial services that provide professionally maintained dictionaries of bad passphrases.",

              "However, such lists are of limited use as they are not designed to address problematic context-specific passwords.",
              "Appropriately restricting context-specific passwords is a particularly vexing challenge.",
              "For example, the inclusion of a user\u2019s own username, the website name, associated organization name or other related terminology is less secure when authenticating a user on the related system.",
              "In the context of protecting a university system, the inclusion of the university\u2019s name, its mascot or derivations thereof in a passphrase could make an attacker\u2019s job of guessing easier.",
              "Thoughtful construction of the prohibited password dictionary may reduce some of this risk.",
              "For instance, if the mascot of a university happens to be a Spartan, it would be wise to add this word and related derivations to the prohibited dictionary.",
              "Eventually, graduates of the university will join other organizations that would have no apparent reason to restrict the same words even though the affiliation remains an important part of the user's personal identity.",
              "Therefore, a generic dictionary approach cannot reasonably block all of the easily discernable affiliations and preferences associated with an individual user, nor would this necessarily be a good idea.",
              "The same word may be an easily guessed affiliation for one person and an obscure and relatively secure choice for another.",
              "This is a nontrivial issue as no standard dictionary will be able to handle these types of \u201clocal vulnerabilities.",
              "\u201d Each organization needs to develop a policy and process to incorporate reasonable user- and organization-specific password restrictions and revisit them regularly.",
              "As systems and organizations evolve over time, the types of keywords and other relevant information that should be restricted can change along with them and a process needs to be in place to track and implement protections against new threats.",
              "Moreover, if a breach occurs, compromised passwords need to be promptly added to the prohibited list.",
              "16 Incorporating these additional restrictions is probably the most technically challenging and process-intensive aspect of implementing the NIST password guidelines.",
              "Regardless, the NIST SP 800-63-3 guidelines make it clear that users should be prevented from using unsafe password heuristics beyond those blocked by the prohibited password dictionary.",
              "For example, users should not be permitted to use repetitive or sequential characters.",
              "17 These additional password construction hazards could potentially be included in a dictionary, but may be simpler to implement programmatically.",
              "The NIST guidelines eschew scheduled mandatory password resets, instead requiring them only when there is suspicion of a breach.",
              "Periodic password resets have been used in part to limit the length of time a system would potentially be exposed to a compromised account,18 a practice that adds security only under the assumption that there has, in fact, been a breach.",
              "Unnecessary password resets not only frustrate users, but also add work for administrators and support personnel.",
              "If passwords changes are not required, it is important that system administrators have the tools and resources to effectively monitor user activity to identify compromised accounts or potential breaches so the threat of unauthorized access can be handled quickly.",
              "This aspect of the NIST guidelines deserves careful thought.",
              "Security professionals need to know the risk profile of their systems, users and the information they protect to make intelligent decisions about breach monitoring and policies around password resets.",
              "The updated NIST SP 800-63-3 password guidelines represent an opportunity for organizations of all types to modernize their user authentication policies and practices.",

              "The NIST guidelines take a step forward in addressing many of the pain points of passwords while encouraging improved security practices by taking into consideration the weakest link in system security\u2014users themselves.",
              "However, organizations that have adopted or may be considering adoption of the NIST SP 800-63-3 guidelines should ensure they have a thorough understanding of the rationale and mechanisms behind the changes in authentication security procedures.",
              "They should also be cognizant not only of the potential advantages of the NIST guidelines compared to traditional password policies, but also of residual risk to user security that are not directly addressed by the new guidelines.",

              "Privileged accounts have far-reaching consequences if unauthorized actors gain access.",
              "Therefore, the passwords used to secure privileged accounts need special protections.",
              "They include changing the password immediately after use and restricting access permissions to one or two trusted individuals.",
              "/Enforce a Password HistoryAlthough repeating or using passwords exposes critical systems to multiple threats, most companies have not implemented measures for curbing the vice.",
              "Enforcing a password history policy prevents a user from using a password used previously.",
              "A password history policy prevents users from reusing a specified number of previous passwords.",
              "For example, a company can create a policy where employees can not repeat twenty previous passwords.",
              "The policy protects against password hacking since it requires users to create new passwords each time they want to change old passwords.",
              "Create a Password Audit PolicyPassword policies enable a company to keep track of all recent password changes.",
              "The policy allows system admins to monitor password changes in a user account.",
              "Password audits are essential since they facilitate the identification of suspicious password habits.",
              "For example, accounts where passwords are changed a few times every day, could mean malicious intent.",
              "Moreover, a password audit policy assists in identifying account users not adhering to password change best practices.",
              "Identifying such users enables an organization to implement more robust password policies to maintain high-security levels.",
              "Secure End DevicesEnd devices, such as smartphones, are used to reset account passwords or for multi-factor authentication.",
              "Failing to secure the end devices allows anyone with access to use them to hack or manipulate passwords.",
              "Individual users should ensure end devices have sufficient security to safeguard password protection.",
              "Strong passwords, or alternative methods like biometrics, should be used to secure end devices that can enable changes or modifications of passwords used to protect confidential accounts.",

              "For single users or small businesses, using MFA is as simple as going to settings for operating systems, web platforms, and service providers and enabling the features.",
              "Larger organizations with their own network portals and complex user-management challenges may need to use an authentication app like Duo, which adds an extra authentication step during login.",
              "MFA is a security enhancement, while SSO is a system for improving productivity by allowing users to use one set of login credentials to access multiple systems and applications that previously may have each required their own logins.",
              "While SSO works in conjunction with MFA, it does not replace it.",
              "Companies may require SSO--so corporate email names are used to log in--in addition to multi-factor authentication.",

              "The costs of hacking and phishing attacks can be high.",
              "Because MFA helps secure systems against unauthorized users--and their associated threats--the organization is more secure overall.",
              "If organizations are hesitant to ask users to comply with tighter security, they should consider that users themselves--especially customers--may appreciate the extra security for their data.",
              "When customers trust a vendor's security protections, they are more likely to trust the organization overall, which means MFA becomes an important competitive advantage.",
              "Successful defenses against attacks can provide a return on investment that covers the expense of an MFA solution--for example, preventing a costly and damaging attack on network resources.",
              "Even without preventing attacks, MFA can save organizations money by allowing IT departments to deploy resources to protect other parts of networks from different threats.",
              "As multi-factor authentication technology advances, making greater use of passive methods like biometrics and software tokens, it becomes more user-friendly.",

              "The dynamic security question, which is more effective and user-friendly, typically asks for contextual information the user has access to, such as a recent financial transaction.",

              "However, not all devices have the necessary software, processing power, and hardware features (such as microphones and cameras), so some users may not be able to take advantage of these advances in MFA usability and security.",
              "Authentication systems can use GPS coordinates, network parameters, and metadata for the network in use, and device recognition for MFA.",
              "Adaptive authentication combines these data points with historical or contextual user data.",
              "These factors have the advantage of operating in the background, with very little input required of users, which means they don't impede productivity.",
              "However, since they require software and expertise to use, they are mostly suitable for large organizations with the resources to manage them.",
              "This is generally used in 2FA but could apply to any MFA method where a second step is introduced dynamically at login upon completing a first step.",
              "The wait for a second step--in which temporary passcodes are sent by SMS or email--is usually brief, and the process is easy to use for a wide range of users and devices.",
              "This method is currently widely used.",
              "On the operational side, two-step authentication requires the use of software or an outside vendor to provide the service.",
              "As with the use of mobile devices as physical tokens, mobile networks can introduce their own security issues.",
              "The security key is generally a QR code that the user scans with a mobile device to generate a series of numbers.",
              "The user then enters those numbers into the website or application to gain access.",
              "The passcodes expire after a certain period of time, and a new one will be generated the next time a user logs in to an account.",
              "In this case a user grants permission for a website to use their social media username and password for login.",
              "This provide an easy login process, and one generally available to all users.",
              "But social media networks are often the target of online criminals because they provide a rich source of user data.",
              "In addition, some users may have concerns about the security and privacy implications of sharing logins with social media networks.",
              "Sometimes called adaptive multi-factor authentication, this method combines adaptive authentication and algorithms that calculate risk and observe the context of specific login requests.",
              "The goal of this method is to reduce redundant logins and provide a more user-friendly workflow.",
              "For users with many logins for various systems, risk-based authentication can be a key time-saver.",

              "Push-based 2FA improves on SMS and TOTP 2FA by adding additional layers of security while improving ease of use.",
              "It confirms a user's identity with multiple factors of authentication that other methods cannot.",

              "In fact, two-thirds of small- and medium-sized businesses reported a cyber attack in 2018.",
              "And, the average cost of the attack on these businesses was almost $3 million due to the costs of sustained system outages and disruption (40% of servers were down for 8+ hours when a breach occurred).",
              "There are a number of reasons for this great increase in attacks, but the main one is that the nature of a wireless network is to provide easy access to end users, but this ease of access creates a more open attack surface.",
              "Unlike a wired network that requires an attacker to physically access part of the network, a wireless network only requires that the attacker be in close proximity (and even this is relative).",
              "Also, there is a general lack of knowledge and awareness of wireless networks.",
              "Let\u2019s cover the general basics of wireless security to gain some background information.",
              "Then we\u2019ll go over, in greater detail, seven of the most common wireless network threats you need to know so you can better protect yourself against them.",
              "One of the most important basic fundamentals that a person or company needs to be aware of when deploying a wireless network is the importance of frequencies.",
              "Frequencies are used by equipment that is being deployed, and it affects the amount of interference that the network will be subject to, depending on the specific environment.",
              "As has been the case for years, there are two main frequency bands that are used for wireless LANs (802.",
              "11): 2.",
              "4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.",
              "From a security perspective, the choice of frequency does not greatly affect the security risk of the network.",
              "What it does affect is the number of available non-overlapping channels that are available on the network.",
              "For the most part, this will not affect security.",
              "That is, except when an attacker is attempting to jam or block a specific frequency to force wireless endpoints to switch Access Points (AP).",
              "Another fundamental to understand is that endpoint devices identify wireless networks using a service set identifier (SSID) along with a set of security parameters.",
              "On most wireless deployments, the SSID is broadcast from the APs, allowing clients the ability to easily associate.",
              "It is possible to not broadcast the SSID, which provides a little protection from wireless network attackers who have little operating knowledge.",
              "However, for an experienced wireless attacker, this is not a very effective security measure.",
              "The real security for a wireless network comes from the selection of a proven security technique.",
              "Currently, the most updated and secure technique is WPA3, which was released in 2018.",
              "This standard provides two different modes of operation: WPA3-Personal utilizes a 128-bit encryption key that is communicated to both sides (AP and client) before establishing a wireless connection.",
              "Its Forward Secrecy protocol improves key exchange security and resists offline dictionary attacks.",
              "WPA3-Enterprise utilizes a 192-bit key-based encryption.",
              "It also uses a 48-bit initialization vector that guarantees a minimum level of security.",
              "Now that you know these basics of wireless security, let\u2019s dive into ten of the most common wireless network threats that you may (or will likely) come across at least once in your career.",
              "While deceitful actions do commonly occur, there are also many accounts of innocent, yet careless, actions are often the cause of a major security breach.",
              "Below are seven of the most common threats to wireless networks.",
              "Simple configuration problems are often the cause of many vulnerabilities because many consumer/SOHO-grade access points ship with no security configuration at all.",
              "Other potential issues with configuration include weak passphrases, feeble security deployments, and default SSID usage.",
              "A novice user can quickly set up one of these devices and gain access, or open up a network to external use without further configuration.",
              "These acts allow attackers to steal an SSID and connect without anyone being the wiser.",
              "To mitigate the risk, use a centrally managed WLAN that features periodic audits and coordinated updates.",
              "Anybody familiar with network security is aware of the concept of denial of service (DoS), also referred to as a \u201cspoiler.",
              "\u201d It is one of the simplest network attacks to perpetrate because it only requires limiting access to services.",
              "This can be done by placing viruses or worm programs on your network, or by simply sending a large amount of traffic at a specific target with the intent of causing a slowdown or shutdown of wireless services.",
              "This allows attackers to hijack resources, view unauthorized information disclosures, and introduce backdoors into the system.",
              "For wireless networks it can be much easier, as the signal can be interfered with through a number of different techniques.",
              "When a wireless LAN is using the 2.",
              "4 GHz band, interference can be caused by something as simple as a microwave oven or a competing access point on the same channel.",
              "Because the 2.",
              "4 GHz band is limited to only three non-overlapping channels (in the U.",
              "S.)",
              ", an attacker just needs to cause enough interference into these to cause service interruption.",
              "A denial of service attack can also be used in conjunction with a rogue access point.",
              "For example, one could be set up in a channel not used by the legitimate access point.",
              "Then a denial of service attack could be launched at the channel currently being used, causing endpoint devices to try and re-associate onto a different channel that is used by the rogue access point.",
              "Passive capturing (or eavesdropping) is performed simply by getting within range of a target wireless LAN, then \u2018listening to\u2019 and capturing data which can be used for breaking existing security settings and analyzing non-secured traffic.",
              "Such information that can be \u201cheard\u201d include SSIDs, packet exchanges, and files (including confidential ones).",
              "Consider the following scenarios that make passive capturing possible: Your office building has multiple tenants, including immediately above or below you on different floors.",
              "You have a lobby just outside your office.",
              "Your parking lot is close to the building.",
              "There is a street that passes nearby.",
              "There are adjacent buildings.",
              "When it comes down to it, passive capturing is possible nearly anywhere.",
              "There are also some go-arounds when an attacker can\u2019t be within normal broadcast range, such as using a big antenna or a wireless repeater device to extend range by miles.",
              "An attacker can even use a packet sniffer application that captures all the outgoing packets, grabs and analyzes them, then reveals its data payload.",
              "You can try a packet sniffer yourself to see the depth and breadth of classified information that is available to anyone who wants to hijack it.",
              "It is almost impossible to totally prevent this type of attack because of the nature of a wireless network.",
              "What can be done involves implementing high security standards by using a firewall, and setting complex parameters.",
              "One method often used by attackers involves setting up a rogue access point within the range of an existing wireless LAN.",
              "The idea is to \u2018fool\u2019 some of the authorized devices in the area to associate with the false access point, rather than the legitimate one.",
              "To really be effective, this type of attack requires some amount of physical access.",
              "This is required because if a user associates with a rogue access point, then is unable to perform any of their normal duties, the vulnerability will be short-lived and not that effective.",
              "However, if an attacker is able to gain access to a physical port on a company network and then hook the access point into this port, it\u2019s possible to get devices to associate and capture data from them for an extended period of time.",
              "The exception to this barrier is when the wireless LAN being targeted only provides internet access.",
              "A rogue access point can also offer simple internet access and leave the user unaware of their vulnerability for an extended amount of time.",
              "Part of the same idea of rogue access points is unauthorized, non-malicious access points and ad-hoc networks.",
              "In these situations, a legitimate user sets up an access point or ad-hoc network for their own use, but does not implement proper security techniques.",
              "This provides an opening for watching attackers.",
              "Some steps you can take to prevent such access points are to: Use proper WLAN authentication techniques and encryption methods.",
              "Establish and communicate a policy prohibiting employees from using their own wireless access points.",
              "Make it easier for employees to gain access to legitimate (and secured) wireless access points.",
              "Regularly walk around your office with a wireless-equipped device to search for rogue access points, looking in every network outlet.",

              "In this way, your online activities will be virtually untraceable and anonymous.",

              "The ability to mask your real location when online is not only good for security reasons, in some cases it's the only way you have to access certain content or site.",
              "Think about if you are living, or even simply travelling, to a country with restrictive internet regulations - like Iran, Russia or the Great Firewall of China for example.",

              "Since my start in 2008, I've covered a wide variety of topics from space missions to fax service reviews.",

              "VPNs have gone from being an obscure networking concept to big business.",
              "You've probably seen the ads from your favorite YouTuber, on podcasts, and even during the Superbowl with claims about how a VPN can make you anonymous or let you access free video streaming.",
              "Do the products live up to the hype?",
              "Although VPNs can be useful tools for protecting your privacy, it's important to understand how these tools work so you can decide whether they will help you.",
              "We break down what VPNs do and what they don't do to help you understand why you'd want one and how to pick the one that's best for you.",
              "VPN stands for virtual private network.",
              "When we talk about VPNs, we're usually talking about a commercial VPN being sold directly to consumers for use in day-to-day life, but the idea of VPNs has much broader applications than that.",
              "Corporations have long used VPN technology to let workers access digital resources no matter where they are, long before COVID-19 made work from home the norm.",
              "When you switch on a VPN, it creates an encrypted connection (sometimes called a \"tunnel\") between your device and a remote server operated by the VPN service.",
              "All your internet traffic is routed through this tunnel to the server, which then sends the traffic off to the public internet as usual.",
              "Data coming back to your device makes the same trip: from the internet, to the VPN server, through the encrypted connection, and back to your machine.",
              "Keep in mind that you don't need another company to set up a VPN.",
              "There are a few options out there to set up your own, such as Outline.",
              "Doing so is fairly straightforward, but you'll either need to maintain a server or rent one, which is less simple.",
              "While there are some efforts to make self-hosted VPNs more accessible, it's something best left to tinkerers who are eager to get their hands (digitally) dirty.",
              "By encrypting your traffic and routing it through a VPN server, it is harder but not impossible for observers to identify you and track your movements online.",
              "No VPNs provide total anonymity, but they can help improve your privacy.",
              "For example, your internet service provider (ISP) is probably the single entity with the most insight into what you do online.",
              "The FTC issued a report in 2021 outlining exactly how much your ISP knows about what you do online, and it's a lot.",
              "Worse, thanks to Congress, your ISP can sell anonymized data about its customers.",
              "If you don't like that a company you're already paying is profiting from your data or if you have concerns about ISPs hoarding detailed information about your activities, a VPN will help.",
              "Not even your ISP can see your web traffic when you use a VPN.",
              "VPNs also make it harder for advertisers and others to track you online.",
              "Normally, data is transmitted from the internet to your device using its IP address.",
              "When the VPN is active, your true IP address is hidden, and anyone watching you can only see the IP address of the VPN server.",
              "By hiding your real IP address, VPNs deny snoops one tool used to identify and track you online.",
              "Despite that, VPNs do not make you fully anonymous online.",
              "Advertisers, for instance, have numerous ways to identify and track you as you move across the web.",
              "Trackers and cookies in websites try to uniquely identify you, and then watch for where you appear next.",
              "Sites and advertisers can also identify you by noting several unique characteristics, such as browser version, screen size, and so on.",
              "On their own, this information is harmless, but when companies compile enough of these identifiers, they form a unique signature\u2014so much so that the process is called browser fingerprinting.",
              "That's not to mention the privacy we give up in exchange for services.",
              "Amazon, Google, and Meta (formerly Facebook) have become pillars of the modern internet infrastructure, and are impossible to completely avoid.",
              "Even if you deleted all your accounts and never used them again, they'd still probably be able to harvest data on you.",
              "These privacy threats require tools other than VPNs.",
              "Ad and tracker blockers, like those found in some browsers or as standalone tools like the EFF's Privacy Badger, address some of these concerns.",
              "Using Tor can guard your privacy even better than a VPN, and grant you access to the Dark Web.",
              "Unlike a VPN, Tor bounces your traffic through several volunteer server nodes, making it much harder to trace.",
              "It's also managed by a nonprofit organization and distributed for free.",
              "Some VPN services will even connect to Tor via VPN, making this arcane system easier to access.",
              "The cost to your internet connection is high, however, as using Tor will degrade your connection much more than a VPN.",
              "Tor isn't perfect either, and it too has plenty of weaknesses to consider.",
              "Keep in mind that law enforcement and government agencies have access to more advanced and invasive techniques.",
              "Given enough time, a determined, well-funded adversary can usually get what it's after.",
              "Several VPNs say they include some protection against malicious files.",
              "Sometimes this is basic protection against known malicious sites and files.",
              "Some VPN services include dedicated antivirus tools as well, and some antivirus companies now offer VPNs.",
              "We don't typically test the malware-detecting abilities of VPNs, since we view VPNs primarily as a privacy service.",
              "To address the threat of malware, we believe standalone anti-malware software\u2014whether it's one you buy or the one that ships with your computer\u2014does a better job.",
              "We believe that VPNs should be paying as little attention to your web traffic as possible.",
              "A VPN will hide the contents of your web traffic from some observers and can make it harder for you to be tracked online.",
              "But a VPN can, at best, provide only limited protection against the threats you're most likely to encounter on the web: malware, social engineering scams, and phishing sites.",
              "There are better ways to address these threats.",
              "Your browser has built-in tools for detecting phishing sites, and so do most antivirus apps, so pay attention when you see a warning.",
              "Use common sense if you see a suspicious pop-up window or receive an unusual email prompting you to take some action.",
              "Many people reuse passwords and use weak passwords, so get a password manager to generate and store unique and complex passwords for each site and service you use.",
              "Finally, protect your online accounts and enable multi-factor authentication wherever it's available.",
              "When a VPN is active, all your traffic is encrypted.",
              "This means your ISP can't see the sites you're visiting or the files you're moving.",
              "But while your ISP maybe can't see you're Torrenting the entire run of Great British Bake Off, they can surmise that you're using a lot of bandwidth.",
              "This alone may be a violation of your terms and conditions.",
              "Pirating content may also be a violation of your VPN's terms and conditions, so be sure to check carefully.",
              "With a VPN, it's possible to connect to a VPN server in another country and browse the web as if you were physically where the VPN server is.",
              "This can, in some cases, get around local content restrictions and other kinds of censorship.",
              "It's easily the noblest use of a VPN, and VPN companies will often play up their role in protecting internet freedom.",
              "Although it should work, it's important to know that a VPN doesn't make your traffic invisible.",
              "Observers can see encrypted traffic, but they shouldn't be able to see the contents of the traffic.",
              "However, the encrypted traffic alone might attract unwanted attention.",
              "Some VPNs include modes that aim to disguise VPN traffic as more common HTTPS traffic.",
              "We don't test the ability of VPNs to bypass censorship and have grave concerns endorsing a VPN service for this ability could put people's lives at risk if we got it wrong.",
              "Simply using a VPN may get you into legal hot water depending on where you are, so know the risks before you try.",
              "Remember, no tool can provide total protection, particularly against a well-funded and capable adversary\u2014a nation-state, for example.",
              "With a VPN, you can connect to a server in a different country and spoof your location.",
              "One of the ways to determine where an internet-connected machine is located is to look at its IP address.",
              "These addresses are distributed geographically and can sometimes be quite close to your true location.",
              "By hiding your true IP address behind the IP address of a VPN server, your true location can be obscured.",
              "But remember that sites and services sometimes have other means of determining your location.",
              "Also, many sites are sensitive to changes in expected behavior.",
              "If your bank sees someone claiming to be you connecting from Latvia, it may require them to do some additional security checks before granting access.",
              "That's generally a good thing, but it can be daunting when it's you using a VPN and not a scammer.",
              "Streaming services sometimes offer different content to different countries.",
              "Until recently, UK residents could watch Star Trek: Discovery on Netflix, while US residents had to use Paramount+.",
              "From the comfort of your home, you can pop over to a far-away VPN server, perhaps to access streaming video unavailable in the US.",
              "Just like government censorship, streaming services know many people use VPNs to access their content and actively work to prevent it.",
              "So, while you can use a VPN to stream video online, and we are sure most of you reading this are, it may work but it may also stop working tomorrow.",
              "The biggest problem with VPNs isn't an issue of technology, but one of trust.",
              "Because all your traffic is passing through its systems, a VPN company is in the same position as an ISP.",
              "It could, if it wished, see everything you do online and sell that data.",
              "It could inject ads into the websites you view.",
              "It could keep unnecessary amounts of data it could then be compelled to hand over to law enforcement.",
              "VPNs are eager to receive that trust, but proving they deserve that trust is difficult.",
              "When we review a VPN, we pore over its privacy policy and send out a questionnaire to get a sense of what efforts each company makes to protect customers' privacy.",
              "We know they could lie to us, but our goal is to put them on record.",
              "We want to see VPNs taking every possible measure to protect their customers, but we also need to see transparency.",
              "Even when we don't agree with all their choices, we prefer companies that are upfront about their operations.",
              "A VPN should also issue a transparency report outlining what requests the company has received from law enforcement and how the company responded.",
              "We also like to see third-party audits of VPN services that validate policies and the security of the company's infrastructure.",
              "We have to acknowledge that audits are imperfect tools.",
              "Audits are commissioned by the VPN company and the company also outlines the scope of the audit.",
              "Still, it's a valuable way to demonstrate a company's commitment to transparency.",
              "A few years ago, VPNs had a better-defined place in your privacy and security toolbox.",
              "Back then, most traffic traveled via HTTP, sometimes without any encryption whatsoever.",
              "Nowadays, most web traffic is sent via HTTPS, which does encrypt your connection.",
              "Looking at HTTPS traffic, an ISP or someone spying on your network can only see the highest level of your traffic's destination.",
              "That's like seeing PCMag.",
              "com and not PCMag.",

              "Advertisers have also become more sophisticated in their tracking efforts.",
              "Browser fingerprinting and other techniques mean a VPN's anonymizing abilities are curbed somewhat.",
              "Even a VPN\u2019s lauded ability to spoof locations, bypass censorship, and unblock streaming is less certain as companies and governments have become increasingly aggressive in detecting and blocking VPN traffic.",
              "The rise of sophisticated tracking methods and HTTPS are often cited as reasons why VPNs aren't worth the money.",
              "But it depends on why you a VPN.",
              "If, for whatever reason, you want your traffic to appear to be coming from another country, a VPN will do that.",
