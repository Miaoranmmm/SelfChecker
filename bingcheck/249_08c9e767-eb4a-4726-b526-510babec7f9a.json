    "query": "What is the most effective way to enhance creativity in individuals, and how can this skill be cultivated in both personal and professional settings?",
    "response": "Creativity is the ability to come up with or recognize ideas to solve problems, communicate with others, or entertain[^2^]. It is a useful skill for people from all walks of life, and it can be enhanced by learning and applying certain techniques and exercises. Some of the ways to enhance creativity in individuals are:\n\n- Watch a funny movie or show. Laughing is a great way to enhance your creative abilities as well as reduce stress and negative emotions[^1^].\n- Get curious. Curiosity is a primary component of creativity. Ask questions, explore new topics, and seek new experiences[^1^].\n- Doodle. Drawing or sketching can help you express your thoughts and feelings, stimulate your imagination, and generate new ideas[^1^].\n- Try a new class. Learning something new can expand your knowledge, challenge your assumptions, and expose you to different perspectives[^1^].\n- Move your body. Physical activity can boost your mood, energy, and brain function, which can all contribute to creativity[^1^].\n- Put toys on your desk. Playing with toys can help you relax, have fun, and unleash your inner child[^1^].\n- Engage in role-playing. Pretending to be someone else can help you empathize with different viewpoints, situations, and emotions, which can enhance your creative thinking[^1^].\n- Create a creative environment. Surround yourself with things that inspire you, such as art, music, books, or plants. Also, make sure your environment is comfortable, well-lit, and free of distractions[^1^].\n- Meditate. Meditation can clear your mind of jumbled thoughts, give you space to observe and reflect, and put your entire brain to work[^2^].\n- Become an expert. Having a rich understanding of a topic can help you think of novel or innovative solutions to problems[^2^].\n- Reward your curiosity. Rather than reprimanding yourself for following an internet rabbit hole, reward yourself when you are curious about something. Give yourself the opportunity and the time to explore new topics[^2^].\n- Take risks. Be willing to try new things, experiment with different approaches, and learn from your failures. Taking risks can advance your creative skills and lead to unexpected outcomes[^2^].\n\nThese strategies can be applied in both personal and professional settings to foster creativity. For example, you can watch a funny movie with your friends or family to relax and have fun; you can get curious about a project or a problem at work and research different solutions; you can doodle during a meeting or a brainstorming session to stimulate your imagination; you can try a new class or hobby that interests you or relates to your career goals; you can move your body by taking a walk, doing yoga, or dancing; you can put toys on your desk at home or at work to play with when you need a break; you can engage in role-playing with your colleagues or clients to understand their needs and expectations; you can create a creative environment by decorating your space with things that inspire you and removing clutter; you can meditate in the morning or before bed to clear your mind and access your whole brain; you can become an expert in a field or a topic that you are passionate about or that is relevant to your work; you can reward your curiosity by following your interests and learning new things; and you can take risks by trying new methods, challenging yourself, and embracing uncertainty.\n\nI hope this helps you enhance your creativity in different aspects of your life\ud83d\ude0a",

              "These latter events regulate, in turn, the number and localization of neuronal synapses, and might influence LTP and episodic memory formation [72].",
              "Many researchers suggested that all these effects are also regulated by the brain capillaries (BC, Figure 1) that reach the neurogenic niche, supplying angiogenetic growth factors, such as the growth and differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [59], and BDNF, that activates a cellular survival pathway involving the serine-threonine kinase AKT and CREB, thus inducing the transcription of genes responsible for almost all the aspects of neuroplasticity [59,72].",

              "Many epidemiologic studies, mostly in the last two decades, also revealed a link between PA, human brain health (and longevity) and epigenetic modifications of the genome, even leading, on one hand, to the concept of \u201cepigenetic age\u201d or \u201cDNA methylation age\u201d (essentially measured, however, as blood cells DNA methylation) [74,75,76,77,78], and, on the other hand, to the acknowledgment that epigenetic mechanisms induced by PA can build up an \u201cepigenetic memory\u201d that affects long-term brain plasticity, neurogenesis, and function [79,80,81,82].",

              "Epigenetic processes modify eukaryotic chromatin structure, and hence gene expression, without changing the underlying DNA sequence, through at least three mechanisms: (i) DNA methylation/demethylation, and post-translational modifications (such as methylation/demethylation and acetylation/deacetylation), of histones on specific residues of their N-terminal tails;",

              "[112] studied the epigenetic effects of exercise on BDNF chromatin regulation, and they found that, like an antidepressant, exercise induced, in the rat hippocampus, DNA demethylation of the BDNF promoter IV, as well as an increase in the levels of phosphorylated MeCP2 (that, in this form, is released from the BDNF gene promoter), thus stimulating BDNF mRNA and protein synthesis [112].",

              "On the other hand, PA caused an increase in BDNF mRNA and was also able to counteract the stress effect, by inducing an increase in histone H3 acetylation at the level of specific BDNF promoters [113].",
              "Since then, a growing body of studies has shown that PA stimulates an activity-dependent cascade of events, involving phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications of signalling proteins, which arrives at the nucleus, where structural organization and function of the chromatin (which includes, among others, the BDNF gene) will be targeted [114].",
              "In conclusion, although all these findings clearly demonstrate a role of PA in regulating the levels of circulating BDNF, the analysis in Table 2 shows that there is no precise exercise protocol that can be favoured in order to obtain a maximal effect on BDNF production and, possibly, on mental health.",

              "This finding suggests that, in the brain of old mice, exercise improves mitochondrial function by inducing a shift in the mitochondrial fission\u2013fusion balance toward fission, even in the absence of modifications in the levels of proteins that regulate metabolism or transport, such as BDNF, HSP60, or phosphorylated mTOR [134].",
              "Autophagy is a physiological process which requires functional lysosomes, and that is involved in recycling proteins as well as in eliminating potentially toxic protein aggregates and dysfunctional organelles [135].",

              "Recently, it has been reported that, in the brain cortex, exercise promotes nuclear translocation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master factor in lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy [139].",
              "The authors found that activation of TFEB depends on the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1), that deacetylates it at K116, allowing its nuclear translocation.",
              "In turn, SIRT-1 is activated by the pathway induced by activation of the AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) [135].",
              "Interestingly, mitophagy (autophagy of mitochondria) declines with age, thus leading to a progressive accumulation of damaged mitochondria [140].",
              "Thus, the autophagy increase, induced by exercise, not only contributes to the elimination of toxic protein aggregates accumulating in the brain, but also produces a specific increase of mitophagy [141].",
              "Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in the body and plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of the correct posture and movement.",
              "In addition, it has a central metabolic function, since, in response to post-prandial insulin, picks up glucose from the blood and accumulates it as glycogen.",
              "As a consequence, age-related loss of skeletal muscle (known as sarcopenia) not only affects body stability and movement, but might also be a cause of hyperglycaemia.",
              "On the other hand, exercise improves glucose uptake in skeletal muscles of patients with type 2 diabetes by activating GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, partially independent of insulin [142,143].",
              "Different kinds of fibres exist in skeletal muscle, which differs for both metabolic and contractile properties: slow-twitch oxidative (SO) fibres have a high content of mitochondria, and myoglobin, and are more vascularized, fast-twitch glycolytic (FG) fibres have a glycolysis-based metabolism, and finally fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic (FOG) fibres have intermediate properties [144].",
              "Skeletal muscle fibres are also classified according to the myosin heavy chain (MHC) isotypes that they produce: type-I fibres, type-IIA fibres, and type-IIX/IIB fibres, roughly corresponding to SO-, FOG-, and FG-fibres, respectively.",
              "Other types of MHC are expressed during embryogenesis or during muscle regeneration [144].",
              "Notably, it seems that also the type of input received from the motor nerve is different for different fibres: type I seems to receive a high amount of inputs at low frequency, while type II seems to receive short inputs at high frequency [145].",
              "Moreover, the contractility properties of muscle fibres do not depend only on the isoforms of contractile proteins expressed, but also on the isotypes of many other proteins, such as those involved in calcium trafficking, and basal metabolism.",
              "These differences also depend on epigenetic differences that also influence the transcription rate of the active genes.",
              "For example, it has been reported that the mobility of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during transcription of the gene encoding PGC-1\u03b1 differ between fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscles, thus affecting the gene expression efficiency [146].",
              "Similar to neurons, skeletal muscle cells are post-mitotic, but dynamic, and have the ability to change their structure and physiology in response to long-lasting stimuli, a property called \u201cmuscle plasticity\u201d [145].",
              "Thus, for example, fast, fatigable muscles could change to slower, fatigue-resistant ones following chronic electrical stimulation.",
              "This remodelling involves an overall change of the structure and metabolism of the fibres, due to modifications of myofibrillar proteins, proteins regulating Ca2+ homeostasis, and enzymes involved in glycolysis and in mitochondrial metabolism.",
              "All these modifications are time- and intensity-dependent, and imply both transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes of gene expression [145,147].",
              "Adult skeletal muscle can also undergo modifications in response to a more natural way of causing electrical stimulation in the muscles: exercise [148].",
              "One of the factors controlling fibre phenotypes is myoblast determination protein (MyoD), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor with a critical function in muscle development, that is more highly expressed in fast fibres\u2014in Myod1-null mice, indeed, fast fibres shift to a slower phenotype, whereas MyoD overexpression induces the opposite shift [149,150].",
              "A reduction of slow fibres is also observed in calcineurin knock-out mice [151] and in mice overexpressing the calcineurin inhibitor regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) [152].",
              "On the other hand, it has been shown that the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) functions as a repressor of fast properties in slow muscles [153], and is involved in the fast-to-slow phenotype switch induced by aerobic exercise.",
              "This effect is due to the NFATs ability to inhibit MyoD action, by binding to its N-terminal transcription activating domain and blocking the recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase p300 [154].",
              "Interestingly, NFAT is one of the targets of calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation.",
              "It is also worth noting that calcineurin is activated by calcium, and hence by conditions that also trigger muscle contraction.",
              "A large body of evidence suggests that muscle contraction per se regulates gene expression and muscle plasticity.",
              "Fluctuation in the intracellular [Ca2+] is certainly the most important signal during muscle contraction;",
              "thus, it is highly probable that the mentioned fibre phenotype modifications and, in general, muscle adaptation to PA are initiated by Ca2+.",
              "Actually, the molecular basis for contractility depends on the mechanism known as excitation-contraction coupling (ECC), and on the complex interplay between voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels, contractile proteins (such as myosin), calcium-binding buffer proteins (such as calreticulin, parvalbumin, and calsequestrin), calcium-sensor proteins (such as calmodulin and calcineurin), and calcium-dependent ATPases [155].",
              "Ca2+ ions are also able to regulate glycolysis by making glucose available through glycogen degradation\u2014in muscle cells, glycogen phosphorylase kinase (PhK), the enzyme that phosphorylates and activates the glycogen breaking enzyme phosphorylase (GP), is activated by the calcium/calmodulin (CaM) complex, that constitutes its \u03b4 subunit [156,157].",
              "Moreover, CaM can also interact with the muscle-specific isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFK-M), the pacemaker of glycolysis [158].",

              "Another important signal due to PA is hypoxia;",
              "in resting muscle cells, prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) use molecular oxygen to hydroxylate the hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), thus allowing its pVHL (von-Hippel-Lindau) E3 ligase-dependent ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation [159].",
              "HIF-1\u03b1 activity is also modulated by the hydroxylation of an asparagine residue (Asn803) by another oxygen-dependent hydroxylase, the factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1);",
              "under normoxic conditions, asparagine is hydroxylated, and this modification prevents interaction of HIF-1\u03b1 with CBP/p300 [160].",
              "In the hypoxic conditions initially induced by exercise, PHDs undergo a decrease of activity, due to shortage of the oxygen substrate, thus hydroxylation of HIF-1\u03b1, and hence its ubiquitination and degradation are limited.",
              "The stabilized factor translocates to the nucleus, heterodimerizes with aryl hydrocarbon nuclear receptor translocator (ARNT)/HIF-1\u03b2, binds to DNA and induces target gene transcription [159].",
              "Genes important for the adaptation of cells to hypoxic conditions and targets of HIFs are, for example, those encoding glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, and angiogenic growth factors [161,162].",
              "A further interesting aspect of muscle activity on muscle function depends on mechanosensing mechanisms, that depend on forces transmitted to the cells by the extracellular matrix (ECM) or by neighbouring cells during muscle contraction;",
              "these forces are simultaneously translated into changes of cytoskeletal dynamics, contributing at the same time to elicit signal transduction pathways [163].",
              "Increasing evidence suggests that a key role in mechanotransduction is played by yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional coactivator that can be regulated by ECM stiffness and rigidity, and by cell stretching [163,164].",
              "This protein interacts with different signal transduction pathways, such as the one involving Wnt/\u03b2-catenin [165], and the one involving Hippo [163].",
              "Recently, it has been reported that mechanical stress also activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), that then triggers phosphorylation of the transcription factor SMAD in a specific linker region.",
              "SMAD phosphorylation inhibits its nuclear translocation, thus resulting in a negative regulation of the growth suppressor myostatin, and induction of muscle growth [166].",

              "Interestingly, by using one-legged activity protocols, it was also found that JNK activity increased only in the exercising leg [167].",
              "It is worth noting that global transcriptome analysis, done on muscle biopsies of young men undertaking resistance exercise, revealed that, in the initial exercises, the stress imposed by muscle contraction induced the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), as well as of muscle damage-, protein turnover-, and inflammation-markers [168];",
              "trained muscles show instead an increase of proteins related to a more oxidative metabolism, and to anti-oxidant functions, as well as of proteins involved in cytoskeletal and ECM structures, and in muscle contraction and growth [168].",
              "Acute resistance exercise also affects the expression of genes encoding components of the ECM, such as matrix metalloproteases, enzymes involved in ECM remodelling [169].",
              "As in the brain, PA-dependent modification of gene expression in muscle mainly depends on epigenetic events.",
              "For example, after 60 min of cycling, HDAC4 and HDAC5 are exported from the nucleus, thus removing their repressive function [170], and, in general, regular aerobic exercise induces decreased DNA methylation of a number of genes [171,172,173].",
              "Two of the most important epigenetically regulated genes are the above-mentioned AMPK and CaMK [142,143].",
              "Moreover, exercise induces rapid and transient changes in the muscle miRNAs (also called myomiRNAs) [174,175]\u2014for example, after an acute activity bout (cycle ergometer, 60 min, 70% VO2 peak), has-miR-1, has-miR-133a, has-miR-133-b, and has-miR-181a increase, while has-miR-9, has-miR-23a, has-miR-23b, and has-miR-31 decrease in the skeletal muscle [175].",
              "Intriguingly, has-miR-1, has-miR-133a, and has-miR-133-b have been instead shown to decrease following an endurance training (cycle ergometer, 60\u2013120 min/section, for 12 weeks, 5 times/week) [176].",
              "As in the case of BDNF, further research is necessary in order to understand the real relationship between PA and miRNA production.",
              "Again, the analytic methods used might cause the observed differences, thus, in addition to further studies, it will be necessary to standardize miRNA purification from muscle and blood.",
              "Finally, muscle contraction results in a transient increase of both oxygen and nitrogen reactive species (ROS and NOS, respectively) that, by interacting with redox state-sensing pathways (such as, among others, P-38/MAPK, NFkB, and AMPK), induce cyto-protective, antioxidant responses.",
              "Activation of these pathways relies in part on post-translational oxidation of cysteines on critical enzymes/regulatory proteins by glutathionylation, that is by reversibly adding glutathione to their thiol groups;",
              "in addition to stimulating protective cell responses, this modification probably prevents further irreversible oxidation of cysteines [177,178].",
              "As a whole, the data reported indicate that PA has several effects on the nervous system\u2014it acts as an antidepressant and an anxiolytic, and can improve mood, self-esteem, and cognition.",
              "The benefits induced by PA on the brain (as well as in other organs, such as the heart) are in part mediated by peptides (myokines) and metabolites released into the blood by the endocrine activity of contracting muscles (Figure 1) [25,179,180,181,182].",
              "Contracting muscles release BDNF, that seems to be involved in autocrine signalling to the muscle itself [182,183,184].",
              "In addition, BDNF probably serves as a retrograde signal to the motor neurons of the spinal cord.",
              "It is also possible that muscle-derived BDNF has an effect on the brain, as intact BDNF was reported to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) in both directions by a high-capacity, saturable transport system [185].",
              "In response to exercise, muscles also release into the plasma high levels of cathepsin-B (CTSB), an abundant, calcium-dependent cysteine protease of the calpain family, produced in all human tissues.",
              "Enzymatically active CTSB is secreted through exocytosis and can degrade components of the ECM in both physiological and pathological conditions [186,187].",
              "Although the mechanism of action of CTSB in the brain is still a matter of debate, it was acknowledged that, after exercise-dependent release from muscles, it can cross the BBB and promote BDNF expression in the hippocampus, neurogenesis, and promote the improvement of spatial memory abilities [188].",
              "It has been reported, for example, that in CTSB knockout mice, running did not have any effect on hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial memory [188].",
              "Similarly, in humans, changes in CTSB levels correlate with hippocampus-dependent memory functions [188].",
              "Intriguingly, it was recently reported that resting serum levels of both BDNF and CTSB were significantly lower in long-term trained middle-aged men in comparison with sedentary controls, even if trained men showed a significant improvement in memory, based on the Free and Cued Immediate Recall tests [107].",
              "Thus, it seems that both BDNF and CTSB molecules increase immediately after exercise, but then decrease to levels lower than in untrained individuals, showing an inverse correlation to the intensity/duration of exercise ([107];",
              "Table 2).",
              "It is tempting to speculate that, as proposed years ago by Ji et al.",
              "[189], and as discussed by De La Rosa et al.",
              "[107] for BDNF and CTSB, most of the regulatory molecules produced in response to PA behave in a hormetic manner: in other words, their concentration should increase at the beginning of the activities, when they play an immediate role in repair processes, at the sites of the traumatic injuries, where oxidative stress is initially induced by exercise.",
              "Then, in well-trained individuals, given the better adaptation to stress, the levels of these molecules could/should decrease.",
              "Thus, their concentrations over time, if put in a graph, should give rise to a curve with the shape of an upside-down \u201cU\u201d.",
              "Such behaviour might also represent one of the variability sources in results found in different studies\u2014analyses performed at different time intervals during and after the exercise might give rise to very different evaluations and interpretations.",
              "FGF21 is primarily produced by the liver, but also by skeletal muscles [179,190]\u2014it is a critical regulator of nutrient homeostasis [191]\u2014in response to PA, it improves thermogenesis in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and even induces differentiation of brown adipocytes [192].",
              "FGF21 also crosses the BBB [193] and, in association with the co-receptor \u03b2Klotho [194], binds to its receptors in the hypothalamus, where it modulates sympathetic input to brown adipose tissue, circadian rhythms, and neuroprotection [182].",
              "Recently, it has been shown that, although all exercise types induce an increase of FGF21, the increase is greater after resistance training than after high-intensity interval (HIIT) sessions [195].",
              "Irisin, the proteolytic cleaved extracellular part of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), is a myokine the expression of which depends on PGC-1\u03b1 [196], and that is positively regulated by muscle contraction [197].",
              "Like FGF21, upon its release into the systemic circulation, irisin may contribute to the browning of white adipose tissue [196].",
              "FNDC5 has been detected in different areas of the brain, where it seems to associate with neural differentiation;",
              "moreover, irisin can cross the BBB [198], and increased levels of circulating irisin correlate with increased levels of BDNF in the mouse hippocampus [197].",
              "Contracting muscles also release cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-15.",
              "As interleukin passage across the BBB has been reported [199], these molecules are putatively able to act on the brain too.",
              "Their effects on the brain are, however, still debated.",
              "For example, both neurodegenerative and neuroprotective properties have been attributed to IL-6 [200];",
              "interestingly, it seems that these different effects depend on the receptors engaged, and the specific signalling pathway triggered: (1) The anti-inflammatory pathway (the classical one) involves the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), expressed for example on microglia, and (2) the pro-inflammatory one (also called the trans-signalling pathway), mediates neurodegeneration in mice, and depends on a soluble form of IL-6R, able to stimulate a response on distal cells [200].",
              "Similarly, IL-8 seems to have both neurogenic and neurotoxic effects [201].",
              "IL-15 receptors are expressed by both glial cells and neurons, with developmental and regional differences.",
              "A neuroprotective role of IL-15 is suggested by the increased motor neuron death in knockout mice lacking the IL-15 receptor \u03b1 (IL15R\u03b1), and by the ability of IL-15 treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).",
              "On the other hand, increased blood levels of IL-15 have been observed in inflammation of several origins [202].",
              "In summary, as in the case of BDNF and CTSB, the levels of the muscle-derived interleukins probably have a hormetic behaviour, and their changes depend on the general adaptation to stress.",
              "It is now widely acknowledged that lactate, produced in large amounts during anaerobic exercise, shuttles among cells and, inside the cells, among organelles, through specific monocarboxylate carriers (MCTs);",
              "interestingly, lactate behaves as a fuel for many cells, including neurons, in conditions of oxygen shortage [203].",
              "Moreover, the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1), a G protein-coupled lactate receptor, is highly enriched in the endothelial- as well as in the pericyte-like-cells of the intracerebral microvessels.",
              "Activation of HCAR1 enhances production of the cerebral vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and cerebral angiogenesis [204,205].",
              "More recently, it was also found that, by signalling through HCAR1, lactate can activate responses that involve both \u03b1 and \u03b2\u03b3 subunits of HCAR1 and is synergic with the activity of other receptors, such as adenosine A1, GABAB, and \u03b12-adrenergic receptors.",
              "As a consequence, not only neurons can use lactate as a substrate during exercise but, in addition, neuronal activity might be finely tuned by this molecule [203,206].",
              "These findings highlight the important role that lactate can play in the PA-dependent muscle\u2013brain crosstalk.",
              "In the last two decades, many laboratories have demonstrated that cells can communicate at long distances by releasing EVs (mainly exosomes and/or small membrane vesicles/ectosomes) that contain many species of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites.",
              "Since they are membrane-bound, EVs can also fuse with the plasma membranes of other cells, thus delivering their content into them and inducing epigenetic modification of the recipient cell functions [207,208].",
              "Central protagonists of EV-mediated trafficking are different species of RNA, and especially miRNAs.",
              "Although many obstacles are still encountered in the identification and purification of EV-carried circulating miRNAs [209], many laboratories have reported that PA induces a significant modification of many miRNAs.",
              "Among these latter species, some (for example, miR-21 and miR-132) have a role in brain functions as critical as regulation of synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and neuronal survival [82].",
              "It is thus possible that one of the ways through which PA and muscle activity influence brain function is by delivering into the blood different species of regulatory molecules that are protected during the trip to other tissues (and to the brain, in particular) because they are packaged into EVs, and these membrane-bound vehicles might finally deliver their cargoes to the brain across the brain capillary endothelial cells.",
              "Interestingly, indeed, exercise stimulates the release of exosomes and small vesicles into circulation [210].",
              "The evidence that regular exercise can help to prevent and even treat neurological disorders has become stronger in recent years.",
              "At the same time, a lot of research is focusing on the mechanisms underlying the ability of PA to improve the symptomatology of neurodegenerative diseases, in the attempt to find out the best protocols to be applied to the patients.",

              "For example, intracerebroventricular- or tail vein-injection of FNDC5 allowed the recovery of memory impairments and synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of AD [212].",
              "Since PA, as already discussed in Section 3, stimulates irisin release from muscle, it is possible that the beneficial role of PA is, at least in part, due to this myokine [213].",
              "Interestingly, the effects of irisin could be also attributed to a lower release of inflammatory cytokines by astrocytes\u2014it was shown, that irisin has protective effects on cultures of hippocampal neurons treated with A\u03b2 peptide, only when co-administered with astrocyte-conditioned medium [214].",
              "In the hippocampus, PA effects include: (i) enhancement of c-Fos- and Wnt3- and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2)-gene expression;",

              "As mentioned, CTSB also crosses BBB, and should be able to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis, and to improve learning and memory, however, AD patients have high levels of this enzyme in the blood, thus, the real role of CTSB in AD remains controversial [205].",
              "Some miRNAs, such as miR-124 and miR-134, have been also suggested to be involved in memory formation and maintenance [218,219].",
              "The relationship between the role of these molecules and BDNF in AD is, however, still debated [220].",
              "Interestingly, in a mouse model of AD, miR-34a is upregulated [221];",
              "it has been hypothesized that swimming training, by inhibiting miR-34a expression, might attenuate age-related autophagy dysfunction and abnormal mitochondrial dynamics, thus delaying both physiological brain aging and AD [123].",
              "An altered metabolic process in AD is that involving demolition of the L-tryptophan, which leads to the formation of kynurenine (KYN);",
              "catabolism of this latter molecule generates, in turn, neurotoxic metabolites related to AD pathogenesis.",
              "KYN is able to cross freely the BBB and, in AD patients, it is found in excess both in the plasma and in the brain.",
              "PA might be protective for neurons because it stimulates the formation of an aminotransferase (KAT) in the muscle, KAT then catalyses the peripheral transformation of KYN into kynurenic acid (KYNA), and is less harmful because it is unable to cross the BBB [182,205].",
              "Recently, it has been also reported that 4 weeks of exercise can revert the induction of gene encoding proteins involved in inflammation and apoptosis in the hypothalamus in a mouse model of AD.",
              "After 6 weeks, an improvement in glucose metabolism was also observed, and after 8 weeks there was an evident reduction of apoptosis in some populations of hypothalamic neurons [222].",
              "Finally, it has been suggested that the benefits noticed in early AD patients following aerobic exercise are due to the exercise-dependent enhancement of the cardiorespiratory fitness, which is in turn associated with improved memory performance and reduced hippocampal atrophy [223].",

              "Dopaminergic neurons of the SNc, which regulate mainly motor function, form the nigrostriatal pathway, innervating neurons located in the caudate nucleus and in the dorsolateral striatum [256,257].",
              "This subdivision is probably an oversimplification because different subgroups of DA neurons have recently been described in human and murine midbrain, which show distinct gene expression profiles [258,259].",
              "Even though it is not yet known whether these DA neurons have specific roles, in some instances it was demonstrated that they have unique projection patterns, connecting them to distinctive areas such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala [260].",
              "Using single-cell RNA sequencing, and PITX3 protein and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as markers for DA neurons, Tiklova\u0300 et al.",
              "[261] identified seven different populations of neurons in the mouse developing midbrain, that could be distinguished thanks to the differential expression of other genes [261].",
              "DA neurons appear to form a brain network regulating the motivational behaviour of animals, allowing them to learn the difference between useful and harmful things, and consequently to choose proper actions [262].",
              "DA also seems to be necessary for performing motivated actions to achieve goals, as demonstrated by the unsuitable behaviour of dopamine deficient mice [263].",
              "In the mammalian central nervous system, DA controls many processes [262,264], such as feeding and locomotion [265];",
              "it is also involved in the mechanisms of cognition and \u2018adaptive\u2019 memory formation, influencing the hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) [266], and upregulates BDNF in the prefrontal cortex [267].",
              "DA most probably interacts with other neurotransmitters and neuromodulators and, for example, it has been recently demonstrated that midbrain mice DA neurons also release IGF-1 that modulates DA release and concentration as well as neuronal firing [268].",
              "As mentioned, a lot of different evidence demonstrates that the mammalian brain is capable of changing its functional and structural characteristics to adapt to the ever-changing surrounding world.",
              "This is achieved by learning and acquiring skills, thus improving cognitive functions.",
              "Neuroplasticity is orchestrated by several neurotransmitters and neurotrophins, and many cues indicate that exercise has an important role in its regulation [269].",
              "In particular, DA regulates emotion and reward-related brain functions, and many authors have postulated that the positive properties of PA may be due to its ability to increase DA concentration [270,271,272].",
              "Interestingly, PA increases the concentration of the same neurotransmitters, including DA, also activated by some drugs and alcohol [273], and this could be the reason why it improves mood in humans [274,275].",
              "Moreover, PA, and specifically voluntary exercise, creates a sharp increase in DA concentration, especially in the nigrostriatal pathway, and has a strong positive effect in overcoming aversion.",
              "Being a molecule involved in the regulation of movement, emotions, and learning, DA could be a key component in the mechanism.",
              "Nevertheless, even though many proofs about DA\u2019s involvement in the beneficial effects of exercise have been accumulating, to date a clear explanation of the underlying mechanism is still missing [276].",
              "One interesting aspect of DA function is that it appears as one of the factors that distinguish physically active organisms from inactive ones, influencing the locomotory activity and even the tendency of the individuals to engage in PA [277].",
              "Voluntary exercise is genetically controlled and depends on different neuromodulators, including DA itself.",
              "Given the enhancing effects of PA on DA production and release in the brain, it can be hypothesized that an auto-sustaining circuit exists by which DA and PA positively interact\u2014the more DA an individual animal produces, the more it is prone to live actively, and the more DA will be consequently released in this feed-forward system [278].",
              "Even though the mechanisms by which exercise, through dopamine, creates positive effects on brain functions are yet to be elucidated, a few hypotheses have been proposed.",
              "For example, it has been demonstrated that voluntary wheel running (VWR) activates latero-dorsal tegmental (LDT) and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) murine neurons and these, in turn, could be responsible for the activation of the DA neurons of the lateral ventral tegmental area (lVTA) [279].",
              "DA increase in the brain can derive from a higher activity of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) enzyme, most probably due to a rise in calcium concentration.",
              "Enhancement of the enzyme activity depends indeed on its phosphorylation by CaMKII, the activity of which is regulated by calcium [280,281].",
              "Actually, wheel running in rodents causes a doubling of the TH mRNA level in the VTA [282], and an increase also in the substantia nigra [283], and in the locus coeruleus [284].",
              "A chronic exercise-dependent high level of DA, but not of other neurotransmitters (such as noradrenalin, serotonin, or glutamate), in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), was found by Chen et al.",
              "[285], and the effect could be reduced by a glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor\u2014the authors suggest that the local DA increase is due to the high level of cortisol, induced by PA in mPFC [285].",
              "In summary, PA may cause an increase in serum calcium levels, and calcium can stimulate dopamine synthesis in the brain by stimulating the activity of the CaMKII, and the consequent activation of the TH enzyme by phosphorylation.",
              "In particular, it has been shown that mice forced to physical activity have a DA level sharply higher in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens, and that a similar effect, i.",
              "e., a specific increase of DA level in these brain regions, can be obtained by intracerebroventricular injection of calcium chloride.",
              "Moreover, following physical activity, a significant amount of TH and CaM was found in mouse neostriatum and nucleus accumbens, and in human, was found in the caudate nucleus and putamen.",
              "A possible mechanism leading to calcium increase in the brain could be the release of lactate following exercise.",
              "This may induce, in turn, an increase of blood acidity that could activate parathyroid hormone, or directly increase calcium concentration by favouring bone resorption [286].",
              "On the other hand, PA-dependent DA increase might also be a consequence of a decrease in the activity of catabolic enzymes, such as the mitochondrial monoamine oxidase (MAO) and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) [287].",
              "In a study aimed at associating genetic background to happiness, Chen et al.",
              "[288] found that women bearing the low expression MAO-A alleles are statistically happier than those bearing the high expressed variant.",
              "Surprisingly, no difference in happiness was found when comparing men bearing the two different type of alleles [288].",
              "Similar results have been reported regarding the COMT gene\u2014women bearing a particular allele, containing the COMT Val158Met polymorphism, and presenting as a consequence a higher DA concentration show an emotionally healthier behaviour [289].",
              "The endogenous opioid system includes different peptides (i.",
              "e., endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins) that derive from larger precursors and bind to G protein-coupled receptors.",
              "Three main receptors (\u03bc, \u03ba, and \u03b4) mediate analgesic effects of these molecules [30].",
              "Several studies have demonstrated PA-dependent increase of circulating opioids, and in particular of \u03b2-endorphin, in relationship with the intensity of exercise, and this \u03b2-endorphin increase correlates with analgesic effects both in humans and in rodents.",
              "Many studies, however, suggest that opioids are not the only molecules involved in analgesia induced by exercise [30].",
              "For example, activation by exercise of the mesolimbic system in rodents has been also related to analgesic effects [290].",
              "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) includes two G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), widely expressed all over the body, and their endogenous ligands, the most well-studied of which are two derivatives of the arachidonic acid: N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA, also known as anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG).",
              "ECS also includes the enzymes necessary for synthesizing and degrading the ligands [291].",
              "In addition to CB1 and CB2 receptors, 2-AG and AEA can bind to the vanilloid receptor (TRPV1);",
              "moreover, AEA also functions as an agonist of some subtypes of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family of nuclear receptors [292].",
              "ECS is critically involved in the modulation of several aspects of metabolism, and, in the hypothalamus, endocannabinoids signalling seems to function in maintaining appetite, in contrast with leptin.",
              "In particular, CB1 is probably involved in reward circuits related to food (i.",
              "e., it is responsible for the hedonic aspect of eating) [292].",
              "An expected consequence of these ECS functions is increased production of endocannabinoids in response to exercise that induces higher energy utilization.",
              "A variety of studies have indeed shown PA-dependent increase of circulating endocannabinoids, even if the results significantly differ from one study to another.",
              "It seems, for example, that the relationship between the increase of AEA and the exercise intensity, as in the case of other already mentioned molecules, is described by an \u201cupside-down U\u201d-shaped curve [292,293].",
              "On the other hand, 2-AG was found significantly elevated in response to short and intense bursts of activity.",
              "It is thus possible that different endocannabinoids (or different mixes of them) are secreted in response to different types, intensities, and durations of exercise.",
              "Moreover, \u201cpreferred\u201d exercises significantly activate ECS, and this response may also contribute to the effects on the mood [294].",
              "Interestingly, it was also reported that hypoxia potentiates ECS activation, and it was suggested that the muscles can be the main source of the exercise-induced increase of circulating endocannabinoids, that then can cross the BBB [292].",
              "Overall, the levels of circulating endocannabinoids are inversely related to anxiety and depression, and positively related to BDNF concentration and, thus, to the beneficial effects on mood and to a sense of vigour and wellbeing.",
              "However, 2-AG and/or AEA levels can be higher in patients with schizophrenia or other cognitive disorders, such as borderline personality disorder [292].",
              "Moreover, these observations are consistent with the evidence that the use of cannabinoid drugs increases the risk of developing psychotic disorders, probably also in relation to alteration of the dopamine signalling [295].",
              "In summary, it is highly probable that these molecules can also have hormetic behaviour (see Section 3.",
              "2.",
              "2).",
              "Since the 1960s, it was known that long-running could cause what was called the \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d, a sudden sense of euphoria and wellbeing, accompanied by analgesia.",
              "For a long time, exercise-dependent production of endorphins was considered responsible for at least the analgesic component of the runner\u2019s high.",
              "More recently, as mentioned, the involvement of both opioids and endocannabinoids in this aspect of the response to PA has been consistently reported [30], and, in addition, it was found that cannabinoid-agonists can enhance the release of endogenous opioids in the brain [295].",
              "We can thus infer that the two systems act in synergy in the anti-nociceptive effects of exercise.",
              "It has been also reported that, at the molecular level, a mediator of endocannabinoid action in response to exercise is AMPK [296].",
              "On the other hand, most other aspects of the runner\u2019s high seem to depend more directly on the endocannabinoid receptors, in mice [297], even if it is not so easy to evaluate euphoria in mice.",
              "It was also suggested that mood improvement could relate to PA-dependent increase of the levels of neurosteroids, and in particular of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) [298], a molecule with a variety of effects on different neurotransmitter receptors, such as the GABAA receptor, and the NMDA as well as the AMPA receptors for glutamate.",
              "DHEA can also bind to nuclear receptors, can contribute to regulating the mitochondrial function in response to stress, and, through activation of G-protein coupled receptors of the plasma membrane, can increase transcription of miR-21, at least in a cell line of hepatocytes [299].",
              "In conclusion, habitual exercise has a variety of positive effects on the human body, from regulating cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular fitness, to improving glycaemia and insulin response.",
              "In addition, as discussed, it is a way of maintaining not only a healthy body, but also a healthy mind, at any age.",
              "In particular, it can represent a non-pharmacological (and sometimes enjoyable) strategy to delay the effects of both physiological ageing and pathological neurodegeneration on brain health.",
              "However, although exercise prescriptions (including frequency, intensity, type, and time) were given, for example, for individuals with hypertension ([20], Table 1 in [23]), we cannot yet refer to specific exercise prescriptions for maximizing the positive effects of PA on cognition [23];",
              "the protocols used in the experiments reported in this review, as well as the subjects and the markers studied (Table 1 and Table 2) are indeed quite different, many informative studies relied on rodents, and not yet on humans.",
              "Further studies are thus necessary to evaluate more precisely how the factors which influence brain functioning change in response to the type, intensity, and timing of exercise.",
              "Further studies are also required to understand the interplay among the many molecules the levels of which change during/after exercise, even in opposite directions.",
              "PA induces, indeed, a variety of cellular and molecular effects, both in the periphery and in the brain.",
              "As we have seen, every molecule/group of molecules probably affects different aspects of brain function, but their synergic effects contribute to brain health as a whole.",
              "Among all these factors a key role seems to be played by BDNF\u2014as a PA effect, this latter molecule is produced in the periphery and can also cross the BBB.",
              "In addition, some BDNF is directly produced in the brain due to the effect of other molecules, some of which are similarly released in the periphery, in a PA-dependent manner, and then cross the BBB, where they affect the function of resident proteins either at the transcriptional or the post-transcriptional level.",
              "Notably, all these effects also depend on the physical pre-exercise conditions of each person.",
              "In this context, an additional issue arises from the actual difficulties of old people and patients with neurodegeneration to perform voluntary exercise.",
              "Interestingly, a recent paper reported that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can increase BDNF and lactate serum concentration even more than voluntary exercise, and might thus represent a solution for individuals who cannot engage in high-intensity exercise or are even unable to perform any exercise at all [300].",
              "It should also be considered that a significant percentage of people with a sedentary, computer-dependent lifestyle consider physical activity not only hard but also boring, and thus lacks motivation to exercise.",
              "From this point of view, a challenging proposal was made in a recent paper, in which the authors reported that a virtual reality-based exercise can be of help for people who cannot and/or do not like to move [301].",
              "Namely, they refer to a particular type of dual-task video-games (exergames) that require, on behalf of the player, also a certain degree of movement, with variable physical components.",
              "The authors suggest that exergames can be also useful for children with impaired motor functions, for people who undergo rehabilitation, and for the elders [301].",
              "Perhaps, the possibility to perform PA in the context of a virtual game can help also in the case of children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities (ID);",
              "it has been reported that children with moderate to severe ID also suffer from low physical fitness [302].",
              "Notably, we are now aware that pharmacological therapies should be ideally shaped on individual patients because of genetic and epigenetic differences affecting responses to the drugs.",
              "When talking of physical activity, tailoring prescriptions to individuals is even more difficult since the ability to perform exercise as well as the exercise outcomes likely depend on a wider set of genes (and their epigenetic setting).",
              "For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms have been observed in a number of genes that encode proteins involved in PA/fitness relationship, such as, for example, the genes encoding BDNF and the e4 allele of apolipoprotein apoE [56], or the genes encoding muscle proteins, such as actinin [303].",
              "These considerations become much more stringent when we focus on the nervous system\u2014every brain is unique because of genetic and epigenetic peculiarities that accumulate throughout our lives, as an effect of learning and experiences that sculpt our mind [304].",
              "Now, although these concepts are clear at the theoretical level, practical applications are still in their infancy, even if rapidly progressing.",
              "In the future, animal models will certainly be helpful to study correlations among specific genes and exercise outcomes.",
              "On the other hand, further studies on humans will be helpful, provided that more homogeneous interventions and standardized measurement methods are used to evaluate exercise-dependent modifications of key parameters.",
              "Finally, as life expectancy is increasing all over the world, it is of the utmost importance for all of us to maintain independence in the daily life activities and a sense of wellbeing as long as possible.",
              "Since PA can clearly contribute in ameliorating physical fitness as well as the mental status, it should be a social and political task to promote the conditions that allow the realization of physical exercise programs for the entire population, and especially for the elders and for children.",
              "In particular, we suggest that both healthy people and patients are encouraged by physicians to perform physical activity, underlining the higher impact and efficacy of moderate and regular exercise, in comparison with acute and heavy bouts of activity.",

              "The first part of the cycle, when a distraction occurs, increases activity in the wide-ranging default-mode network (DMN).",
              "This network includes areas of the medial prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, the precuneus, the inferior parietal lobe and the lateral temporal cortex.",
              "The DMN is known to become activated during mind wandering and to play a general role in building and updating internal models of the world based on long-term memories about the self or others.",
              "The second phase, becoming aware of a distraction, correlates with the activity of other brain areas such as the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex, regions of what is called the salience network.",
              "This network is thought to play a key role in selecting which stimuli deserve attention.",
              "Here its activity may facilitate the shift of the mind away from distractors, for instance.",
              "The third phase engages additional areas\u2014among them the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the lateral inferior parietal lobe\u2014which are involved in orienting attention.",
              "Finally, in the fourth and last phase, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is involved in monitoring attention, continues to retain a high level of activity, as the meditator's attention remains directed toward an object such as the breath.",
              "In our laboratory at Wisconsin, we further observed different patterns of activity depending on a practitioner's level of experience.",
              "Veteran meditators with more than 10,000 hours of practice showed more activity in these attention-related brain regions compared with novices.",
              "Paradoxically, the most experienced meditators demonstrated less activation than the ones without as much experience.",
              "Advanced meditators appear to acquire a level of skill that enables them to achieve a focused state of mind with less effort.",
              "These effects resemble the skill of expert musicians and athletes capable of immersing themselves in the \u201cflow\u201d of their performances with a minimal sense of effortful control.",
              "To study the impact of focused-attention meditation, we also studied its volunteers before and after a three-month retreat with intensive meditation exercises for at least eight hours a day.",
              "They received headphones that broadcast sounds at a given frequency, occasionally mixed with slightly higher-pitched sounds.",
              "They had to focus on the sounds played in one ear for 10 minutes and react to periodically interspersed high-pitched tones.",
              "After the retreat, we found that meditators, compared with a nonmeditating control group, showed less trial-to-trial variation in their reaction times on this highly repetitive task, which lent itself easily to distractions.",
              "The result suggested that the meditators had an enhanced capacity to remain vigilant.",
              "The brain's electrical responses to high-pitched tones remained more stable at the second session only for the meditators.",
              "The second type of well-studied meditation also involves another form of attention.",
              "Mindfulness, or open-monitoring meditation, requires the meditator to take note of every sight or sound and track internal bodily sensations and inner self-talk.",
              "The person stays aware of what is happening without becoming overly preoccupied with any single perception or thought, returning to this detached focus each time the mind strays.",
              "As awareness of what is happening in one's surroundings grows, normal daily irritants\u2014an angry colleague at work, a worried child at home\u2014become less disruptive, and a sense of psychological well-being develops.",
              "With Heleen Slagter, then in our group at Wisconsin, we sought to learn about the influence of this form of training on mental functioning by measuring the participants' capacity to detect rapidly presented visual stimuli\u2014a means to measure mindfulness meditation, which is also sometimes called nonreactive awareness.",
              "To perform this experiment, we used a task in which the participants had to detect two numbers presented on a screen rapidly, amid a succession of letters.",
              "If the second number appears about 300 milliseconds after the first one, subjects often do not see the second, a phenomenon known as attentional blink.",
              "If the second number appears after a delay of 600 milliseconds, it can be detected without difficulty.",
              "The attentional blink reflects the limits of the brain's ability to process two stimuli presented to the observer at close intervals.",
              "When too much of the brain's attention is devoted to processing the first number, the second number cannot always be detected, although the observer usually can see it on some of the trials.",
              "We hypothesized that mindfulness training could reduce the propensity to \u201cget stuck,\u201d or absorbed, by seeing the first number.",
              "Mindfulness practice cultivates a nonreactive form of sensory awareness, which should result in a reduced attentional blink.",
              "As we predicted, after three months of an intensive retreat, the meditators perceived both numbers more frequently than the controls did.",
              "This improved perception was also reflected in lessened activity of a particular brain wave in response to the first number.",
              "Monitoring the P3b brain wave, used to assess how attention is allocated, indicated that meditators were capable of optimizing attention so as to minimize the attentional blink.",
              "Staying aware of an unpleasant sensation can reduce maladaptive emotional responses and help one to move beyond the disagreeable feeling and may be particularly useful in dealing with pain.",
              "In our Wisconsin lab, we have studied experienced practitioners while they performed an advanced form of mindfulness meditation called open presence.",
              "In open presence, sometimes called pure awareness, the mind is calm and relaxed, not focused on anything in particular yet vividly clear, free from excitation or dullness.",
              "The meditator observes and is open to experience without making any attempt to interpret, change, reject or ignore painful sensation.",
              "We found that the intensity of the pain was not reduced in meditators, but it bothered them less than it did members of a control group.",
              "Inner pathways of brain activity register on an electroencephalogram as co-author Matthieu Ricard meditates.",
              "Credit: Jeff Miller University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Compared with novices, expert meditators' brain activity diminished in anxiety-related regions\u2014the insular cortex and the amygdala\u2014in the period preceding the painful stimulus.",
              "The meditators' brain response in pain-related regions became accustomed to the stimulus more quickly than that of novices after repeated exposures to it.",
              "Other tests in our lab have shown that meditation training increases one's ability to better control and buffer basic physiological responses\u2014inflammation or levels of a stress hormone\u2014to a socially stressful task such as giving a public speech or doing mental arithmetic in front of a harsh jury.",
              "Several studies have documented the benefits of mindfulness on symptoms of anxiety and depression and its ability to improve sleep patterns.",
              "By deliberately monitoring and observing their thoughts and emotions when they feel sad or worried, depressed patients can use meditation to manage negative thoughts and feelings as they arise spontaneously and so lessen rumination.",
              "In 2000 clinical psychologists John Teasdale, then at the University of Cambridge, and Zindel Segal of the University of Toronto showed that for patients who had previously suffered at least three episodes of depression, six months of mindfulness practice, along with cognitive therapy, reduced the risk of relapse by nearly 40 percent in the year following the onset of a severe depression.",
              "More recently, Segal demonstrated that the intervention is superior to a placebo and has a protective effect against relapse comparable to standard maintenance antidepressant therapy.",
              "The third form of meditation under study cultivates attitudes and feelings of loving kindness and compassion toward other people, whether they are close relatives, strangers or enemies.",
              "This practice entails being aware of someone else's needs and then experiencing a sincere, compassionate desire to help that person or to alleviate the suffering of other people by shielding them from their own destructive behavior.",
              "To generate a compassionate state may sometimes entail the meditator feeling what another person is feeling.",
              "But having one's emotions resonate empathetically with the feelings of another person does not by itself suffice to yield a compassionate mindset.",
              "The meditation must also be driven by an unselfish desire to help someone who is suffering.",
              "This form of meditation on love and compassion has proved to be more than just a spiritual exercise.",
              "It has shown potential to benefit health care workers, teachers and others who run the risk of emotional burnout linked to the distress experienced from a deeply empathetic reaction to another person's plight.",
              "The meditator begins by focusing on an unconditional feeling of benevolence and love for others, accompanied by silent repetition of a phrase conveying intent, such as \u201cMay all beings find happiness and the causes of happiness and be free from suffering and the causes of suffering.",
              "\u201d In 2008 we studied experienced volunteers who had practiced this form of training for thousands of hours and found an increase in activity in several brain regions while they listened to voices conveying distress.",
              "The secondary somatosensory and insular cortices, known to participate in empathetic and other emotional responses, were more activated for experts than controls in response to the distressed voice, suggesting an enhanced ability to share the feelings of others without reporting any sign of becoming emotionally overwhelmed.",
              "The practice of compassion meditation also produced more activity in areas such as the temporoparietal junction, the medial prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus, all typically activated when we put ourselves in the place of another.",
              "More recently, Tania Singer and Olga Klimecki, both at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, in collaboration with one of us (Ricard), sought to distinguish differences between the effects of empathy and compassion on meditators.",
              "They noted that compassion and altruistic love were associated with positive emotions, and they suggested that emotional exhaustion or burnout was, in fact, a kind of empathy \u201cfatigue.",

              "The coordination of brain oscillations may play a potentially crucial role in the brain's building of temporary networks that can integrate cognitive and affective functions during learning and conscious perception, a process that can bring about lasting changes in brain circuitry.",

              "One type of curiosity is general curiosity.",

              "A second type of curiosity is specific curiosity.",

              "Specific curiosity is what might prompt us to stick with trying to solve a particular perplexing riddle, or to figure out precisely how a complicated piece of machinery works.",
              "The researchers wanted to know if creative problem solving was more strongly impacted by general curiosity or by specific curiosity.",
              "The study was also designed to examine the question of when, in the creative process, did the effects of curiosity emerge.",
              "When was the influence of these two types of curiosity the strongest: During initial information seeking or problem scoping, or during actual idea generation?",
              "A creative problem-solving challenge To examine these questions, the researchers asked 122 undergraduates to complete a computerized creative problem-solving task.",
              "The task began with the participants receiving an email \u2014 allegedly from their supervisor at a company they had recently joined \u2014 describing the company and detailing their new role as the head of advertising for the company.",
              "Participants learned that they were to develop a marketing strategy to increase sales of the company's product at various company locations, but that they should especially focus on increasing product sales rates among young adults (17 to 29 years old).",
              "They were then given as much time as they wanted to review a large set of background materials about the problem.",
              "Next, when the participant indicated they had finished reviewing the background information, they were asked to generate a list of ideas for the marketing plan.",
              "After first providing a rough draft of their ideas, they were asked to write a more detailed plan to be formally presented to the company leaders.",
              "As they worked on the plan they could again ask to consult any of the background materials.",
              "The total amount of time that participants took to review the background materials provided a measure of their information seeking.",
              "The idea listing task\u00ad\u00ad \u2014 including the number of ideas and different types of ideas that were generated, as scored by three independent raters \u2014 provided a measure of their idea generation.",

              "The marketing plans were scored by three doctoral students in industrial or organizational psychology to assess the quality of the proposed plan and the plan's originality.",

              "The new information gathered through information seeking sparked deeper idea generation, indirectly boosting creativity.",
