    "query": "What are the most effective methods and tools for promoting self-care and mental wellness, and how can individuals incorporate these practices into their daily lives for long-term benefits?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Promoting self-care and mental wellness is important for your overall health and quality of life. There are many methods and tools that can help you improve your emotional well-being and cope with stress and challenges. Here are some examples:\n\n- **Physical self-care**: This involves taking care of your body by eating healthy, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and avoiding substances that can harm you. Physical self-care can boost your mood, energy, and immune system.[^2^] [^5^]\n- **Cognitive self-care**: This involves taking care of your mind by engaging in activities that stimulate your curiosity, creativity, and learning. You can read for leisure, do puzzles, learn new skills, or explore new topics. Cognitive self-care can help you sharpen your mind, expand your knowledge, and reduce boredom.[^5^]\n- **Emotional self-care**: This involves taking care of your feelings by expressing them in healthy ways, practicing gratitude, showing compassion for yourself and others, and finding things that make you happy. You can journal, meditate, listen to music, watch a comedy, or talk to a friend. Emotional self-care can help you manage your emotions, cope with stress, and increase your resilience.[^1^] [^2^] [^5^]\n- **Spiritual self-care**: This involves taking care of your sense of meaning and purpose by exploring your beliefs, values, and passions. You can practice your faith, meditate, pray, volunteer, or spend time in nature. Spiritual self-care can help you connect with something bigger than yourself, find inner peace, and align your actions with your principles.[^1^] [^2^]\n- **Social self-care**: This involves taking care of your relationships by building a supportive network of positive and healthy people. You can reach out to your friends or family members, join a club or group, or seek professional help when you need it. Social self-care can help you feel less lonely, more connected, and more supported.[^2^] [^5^]\n\nTo incorporate these practices into your daily life for long-term benefits, you can start by setting small and realistic goals for each area of self-care. For example, you can aim to drink eight glasses of water a day for physical self-care, read a book for 30 minutes a day for cognitive self-care, write down three things you are grateful for every night for emotional self-care, meditate for 10 minutes a day for spiritual self-care, and call a friend once a week for social self-care. You can also use tools like calendars, reminders, trackers, apps, or workbooks to help you plan and monitor your progress.[^1^] [^4^] Remember to be flexible and gentle with yourself as you try new things and find what works best for you.",

              "It\u2019s the stress of trying to keep up with the pace of daily life, which technology has hastened more than ever (just think how many emails come flooding into your inbox each day).",

              "Research suggests self-care promotes positive health outcomes, such as fostering resilience, living longer, and becoming better equipped to manage stress.",

              "Self-care can look different for everyone, but to count as self-care, the behavior should promote health and happiness for you.",

              "Note any positive changes, and add in more practices when you feel ready.",
              "As self-care has become more mainstream, the definitions have started to become more about general wellbeing and tend to focus on tuning in to one\u2019s needs and meeting those needs.",

              "The underlying rule is that it\u2019s something that brings you sustained joy in the long run, Courtney says.",
              "And though there are plenty of examples of self-care that seem to tread a fine line between a health-enhancing behavior and self-indulgence, self-care doesn\u2019t have to be about padding your calendar with luxurious experiences or activities that cost money (though it certainly can).",

              "It might seem indulgent, but if the activity helps you de-stress and carve out time for yourself, it counts as self-care, Amsellem says.",
              "If weekly manicures or monthly spa days are beyond your means, they will likely add stress to your life in the long run, so there are plenty of other self-care practices you can adopt.",

              "\u201cBut if there are some days when you feel out of control, on those days, starting the day off doing what you wanted to do for yourself might be one of the biggest forms of self-care you engage in that day.",

              "\u201d In addition to balancing their own stress with that of their patients and students, psychologists are facing unprecedented logistical challenges\u2014working from home with families around, navigating new technologies involved in telehealth and remote teaching, and overcoming barriers to certain treatment methods.",
              "For practitioners, many types of treatment are easy to deliver online;",
              "however, some services are more difficult to transform into successful remote solutions.",
              "For example, it may be difficult for clinicians to conduct exposure therapy for social anxiety when it\u2019s not safe to go out in public, says Erica Wise, PhD, an ethics consultant and clinical professor emerita in the clinical psychology doctoral program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.",
              "\u201cDepending on the specific focus of their practice, there may be complex technical layers involved in effectively translating evidence-based treatment to a virtual context, especially during a pandemic.",
              "Among many examples, this would apply to the work of psychologists who are treating people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, health and contamination fears or phobias, social anxiety, isolation, depression, and hoarding disorders,\u201d Wise says.",

              "\u201d Even when patients don\u2019t have complex treatment plans, psychotherapy can contribute to a risk of burnout.",
              "Psychologists can easily grow exhausted by addressing the same stress without new solutions, says Natalie Dattilo, PhD, a clinical psychologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.",
              "Before the pandemic, she says, patients presented with diverse problems;",
              "now, there\u2019s not as much variety, and there are constant reminders about how difficult life is for everyone.",
              "Black practitioners in particular face unprecedented, prolonged strain.",
              "Not only are Black individuals sorting through their own trauma with therapists in higher frequency, but White people are increasingly seeking support from Black professionals to work through issues of racism brought up by current events.",
              "\u201cNow that there\u2019s a White lens on these topics, there\u2019s so much more demand for Black therapists to be talking about these issues we\u2019ve been attuned to our entire lives,\u201d says Ayanna Abrams, PsyD, a clinical psychologist and founder of Ascension Behavioral Health in Atlanta.",
              "It\u2019s important for psychologists to advocate for each other in material ways, says Laura Boxley, PhD, ABPP-CN, chair of APA\u2019s Advisory Committee on Colleague Assistance (ACCA).",
              "\u201cIf I recognize that the well-being of my colleague is related to my leadership as division chair or director of training, it becomes my responsibility to set policy that protects the well-being of those that work for me,\u201d she says.",
              "The longer this stress goes on, the more likely it will surface in, and potentially interfere with, psychologists\u2019 work.",
              "\u201cOur personal wellness as psychologists really does impact our ability to help our patients or teach our students, because it directly interfaces with our competence,\u201d says Wise.",
              "For example, Abrams says, chronic stress can prompt people to feel disconnected from themselves and others, which can result in a less-attuned, less-sensitive, less-empathic therapist or professor.",
              "Stress can also impair treatment and teaching more directly: Under strain, it\u2019s more difficult to exercise flexible and creative thinking, which Abrams says can in turn make it hard to help patients reframe their own thoughts\u2014a crucial component of psychotherapy.",
              "Even if a psychologist\u2019s stress doesn\u2019t noticeably interfere with treatment, patients and therapists are likely to catch on, says Brittany Avila, PhD, an instructor of psychology at the University of Nevada, Reno.",
              "A psychologist\u2019s own neglect of self-care can prevent patients or students from taking suggestions for coping strategies seriously.",
              "Clinicians and professors alike are responsible for modeling healthy emotions and behavior.",
              "In order to teach other people to engage in self-care during stressful periods, you have to exhibit positive behaviors yourself.",
              "\u201cIf you don\u2019t model it yourself, they won\u2019t take it seriously, or they just won\u2019t know how to practice it,\u201d says Avila, who regularly includes self-care practices as graded assignments in her courses.",
              "Unfortunately, self-care is hard to come by, and that\u2019s no different for psychologists.",
              "In a society that demands productivity, it can be tough\u2014and even feel selfish\u2014to fit new, self-focused practices into an already busy schedule.",
              "John Norcross, PhD, ABPP, a distinguished professor and the chair of the Department of Psychology at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania and a clinical professor of psychiatry at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York, encourages psychologists to reframe thoughts about self-care from a luxurious add-on to a professional imperative.",
              "\u201cWithout self-care, there\u2019s not good patient care,\u201d Norcross says.",
              "\u201cIntegrating it into a routine becomes easier when you see it not as an additional burden but as part of your profession and craft.",
              "\u201d Here are some practical strategies for incorporating self-care into your life and work, as suggested by fellow psychologists.",
              "The first step to ensuring your own well-being is monitoring your own stress levels and how they\u2019re affecting you emotionally and physically.",
              "Rodriguez encourages prioritizing attention to one\u2019s body: Ample sleep, a nutritious diet, and routine exercise are building blocks for well-being, and they support the ability to cope with stress.",
              "To ensure these practices make it into your daily life, Wise recommends building a routine\u2014scheduling time to break for meals, setting an alert to remind you of a reasonable bedtime, and leaving your shoes by the bed as a signal to go for a morning walk.",
              "If you notice you\u2019re feeling exhausted or disconnected at any point, resist the urge to power forward and, instead, tune in to your body.",
              "Mindfulness and meditation, which don\u2019t have to be time-consuming, are both proven to reduce stress.",
              "If you find yourself tense during a therapy session, Norcross suggests adjusting your posture, moving your legs a bit in a way that doesn\u2019t distract the patient, and taking a drink of water.",
              "While self-care hinges on self-awareness, ensuring your own well-being is rarely as simple as sleeping a few more hours each night or eating more vegetables\u2014especially for mental health professionals, Boxley says.",
              "For that reason, it\u2019s important to adopt a comprehensive, individualized approach\u2014and to avoid making self-care another to-do item, which can only compound feelings of burnout.",
              "One way to do that: Go easy on yourself and celebrate any progress you make.",
              "You\u2019ll be discouraged from sticking with your self-care routine if you aim for perfection.",
              "\u201cThese aren\u2019t issues we ever get fully solved,\u201d Wise says.",
              "\u201cWe\u2019ll always be working on taking care of ourselves.",
              "\u201d If you tend to see self-care as a last-ditch effort to restore dwindling energy, try shifting your perspective, suggests Diane Bridgeman, PhD, a current board member of the Monterey Bay Psychological Association and former chair of ACCA.",
              "Rather than a reactive strategy, self-care should be seen as a comprehensive method of ensuring you\u2014and your clients, staff, or students\u2014thrive.",
              "\u201cHow you define self-care is important,\u201d she says.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about being OK, but about flourishing, which requires de-stressing from everyday problems before they become serious.",
              "\u201d While self-care works best when it\u2019s proactive, everyone\u2019s practice is unique.",
              "Bridgeman encourages people to think through activities and relationships that spark joy.",
              "In what situations are you able to truly relax, reflect, and regroup?",
              "Aim to build those experiences into your routine alongside the building blocks of health, and remember that feeling guilty about not \u201csufficiently\u201d following your self-sustaining routine is counterproductive.",
              "In a national survey of psychologists, Bridgeman and clinical psychologist Daniel Galper, PhD, found that 72% of psychologists reported that their number one concern and personal and professional challenge was an \u201coverly challenging work-life balance,\u201d followed closely by \u201cburnout or compassion fatigue.",
              "\u201d Bridgeman says the risks for those challenges have only increased during COVID-19.",
              "The demands on your time and attention may be more intense than ever, which is why it\u2019s so important to limit how much you devote to work.",
              "If you work outside the home, Norcross suggests implementing a ritual that reminds you you\u2019re done working when you enter your door.",
              "For example, you could change clothes, make a cup of tea, or turn on your favorite music\u2014anything that turns off your \u201cwork\u201d switch.",
              "Now that many professionals are working from home, it\u2019s even easier for work to trickle into hours normally reserved for rest or recreation.",
              "It\u2019s inevitable that unexpected, timely tasks will pop up on occasion, but do your best to stick with a routine that separates work time from personal time.",
              "Consider adding a \u201cfake commute\u201d to your routine, which replaces the daily transition from work to home with walks, runs, and bike rides.",
              "And if you don\u2019t have a dedicated home office, do your best to reserve your workspace for work alone.",
              "On top of clarifying when you work, reconsider how much you work and with whom.",
              "For example, Abrams says she often receives emails from laypeople and professionals who want to tap into her expertise of racism-based trauma to overcome their own biases.",
              "Instead of educating people about the impact of racism by email, she recommends referring them to another therapist or an online resource.",
              "You may also want to rethink your patient load and what types of patients you take on\u2014especially if more work would interfere with your ability to take care of yourself and support your patients.",
              "\u201cMany of us tend to give from what we have left, but it\u2019s important for psychologists, especially marginalized populations, to offer to others from a place of rest,\u201d Abrams says.",
              "While it is important to promote balance in your work life, it\u2019s not always easy (or possible) to control systemic factors that contribute to burnout, like gender expectations and division of labor at home and in the workplace, Boxley says.",
              "She advocates for people in positions of power to challenge the system that impedes equitable strategies for professional and personal well-being.",
              "\u201cTop-down pressures are often not amenable to an individual just deciding to set boundaries,\u201d she says.",
              "It\u2019s easy to isolate in chronic stress, especially when getting together with a friend or family member in person might not be a safe option.",
              "According to Rodriguez, feeling disconnected only compounds the original stress.",
              "Prioritizing social interaction with friends and family can be helpful.",
              "But a professional outlet is meaningful, too.",
              "To take advantage of community support, you can also find a mentor, connect with your supervision group, or reach out to professional organizations such as APA or the Association of Black Psychologists for resources.",
              "Norcross suggests psychologists also occasionally go to therapy themselves when stress levels are high.",
              "Samara Toussaint, PsyD, a clinical psychologist and founder of Path2Growth Counseling Services in Long Island, New York, says she began reaching out to colleagues for support after COVID-19 caused her practice to triple.",
              "\u201cWe\u2019ve never dealt with so many compounded issues at once, and we really need to take the time to process what we experience with colleagues\u2014people who understand,\u201d Toussaint says.",
              "\u201cThat \u2018me too\u2019 can go a long way.",
              "\u201d Because your normal coping mechanisms might not be available right now because of the pandemic, look for creative ways to replenish your reserves.",
              "As easy as it is to zone out by scrolling news or social media when you\u2019re tired, keep in mind that form of stimulation\u2014which Wise says is called \u201chyperreality\u201d\u2014only serves to add stress.",
              "Instead, schedule events or activities you can look forward to that also encourage a sense of mastery, such as a home project or a physically distanced outdoor activity you enjoy.",
              "Take advantage, too, of any self-care resources in your organization.",
              "According to Boxley, psychologists generally agree about the centrality of self-care, but they\u2019re often not aware of resources already available to them, even as many organizations are stepping up to provide self-care opportunities for staff.",
              "Christopher Watson, PhD, deputy associate chief of staff of behavioral health at VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, says he sees it as his responsibility to help his team provide the best clinical care to the veterans they work with.",
              "In addition to recharging opportunities at work\u2014his organization streams virtual meditation sessions throughout the week\u2014he encourages staff to use their leave when possible, or to shift around their schedules to better balance work with their kids\u2019 distance learning.",
              "\u201cWhen we make these changes, it\u2019s not just about convenience,\u201d Watson says.",
              "\u201cWe always want to give our staff more opportunities to unplug so we can improve their coping and resilience and, as a result, improve the care they provide.",
              "\u201d At its core, Dattilo says self-care is about self-compassion.",
              "Practically, that means recognizing your own limits and, if necessary, letting yourself off the hook.",
              "For example, you may not accomplish as much as you did in previous years, and your patients or students may not make major strides, either.",
              "That\u2019s OK.",
              "\u201cRight now, it may not be about remission or absence of symptoms but about helping people improve their coping and resilience,\u201d Watson says.",
              "The same applies for instructors: If you can preserve your students\u2019 progress, you\u2019re likely ahead of the curve.",

              "The strongest contribution was students\u2019 level of spirituality and their level of religious commitment, whilst the amount of emphasis on spirituality within the nursing course according to staff and faculty were the greatest environmental predictors.",
              "(32) notes that within and between private and public nursing school programmes there can be variations in spiritual care training, with an impact upon the spiritual awareness of students.",
              "It was suggested that those who attended religious colleges were more likely to regard spirituality as important, and that those attending courses with a greater emphasis or integration of spirituality into the curriculum were more likely to have increased spirituality awareness.",
              "However, (37) reported that degree of emphasis on spirituality in the nursing curriculum did not relate to level of awareness of spirituality and their use of strategies to address patients\u2019 spiritual needs and (36) reported that level of comfort in providing spiritual care was not seen to relate to spirituality.",
              "(37) in their comparison of faith based and public school nursing programmes, observed that students\u2019 scores on the Spirituality Scale (which assessed level of awareness of spirituality and their use of strategies to address patients spiritual needs) did not differ significantly between the two types of students.",
              "This again emphasises the many aspects of spirituality which are considered within the literature and the array of ways variables can influence different facets of spiritual care.",
              "Though assessing the degree to which student nurses are willing and able to provide spiritual care is important, possibly of more relevance is an understanding of what affects spiritual care provision in qualified nurses, as not only are they the ones in the trenches but will provide role models and mentors to student nurses as they enter practice.",
              "In their study of hospice and oncology nurses (31) examined the nurses\u2019 levels of spirituality training.",
              "It appeared there may have been differences in the education the nurses received before qualifying: Differences were apparent in their basic education: 35% of oncology nurses reported that spirituality was integrated throughout their basic education whilst 4% of hospice nurses did, however neither group were likely to report completing a course as part of their basic education (6% oncology, 10% hospice).",
              "This may of course reflect differences in education which impacted the choice of specialism that the nurses chose to work in (e.",

              "It seems then that nurses working within the hospices surveyed received more training than oncology nurses;",
              "it was also reported that hospice nurses perceived their preparation as more adequate than oncology nurses, although the discrepancies in sample size are observed.",
              "The majority of the nurses overall (hospice and oncology) felt that they had been inadequately prepared for spiritual care provision, particularly those working in oncology.",
              "Inadequate preparation appears to be another key theme in spiritual care provision, with this review observing that interventions have been considered as a way of improving nurses\u2019 ability and willingness to provide spiritual care.",
              "For example, (34) suggested that educational interventions can increase levels of knowledge and comfort with conducting spiritual assessment, whilst (25) used The Spiritual Care in Practice (SCIP) (25) and found that interventions help increase respondents\u2019 perceived ability to provide spiritual care, especially in complex clinical situations.",
              "Intervention programmes have also been seen to improve attitudes towards spiritual care giving (SCPS-R), the ability to provide an empathic response, and levels of knowledge about communicating with patients about spirituality (29).",
              "(29) report that a number of factors were seen to predict improvements in attitude towards spiritual care giving: Age, frequency at attendance at religious services and initial spirituality score (DSES) although explaining only a small amount of variance.",

              "(29) also suggested that the amount of spiritual care education received predicted learning about responding emphatically.",
              "However, these improvements did not appear to be impacted by the type of institution the participants were currently attending: religious or non-religious institution.",
              "This may suggest that it is not the religiosity of the institution that needs to be considered but the content of the programmes therein.",

              "Research (27) suggests that the source of spiritual care training can be influential in terms of willingness to provide specific aspects of spiritual care: Those who had attended continued professional development were the most likely to state they were \u201cwilling to guide patients to find inner peace\u201d (a specific facet of spiritual care) than those who had received training in other ways e.",

              "The research considered above fragmented spiritual care knowledge into different facets and has suggested that knowledge varies in different types of spiritual care.",
              "It was reported that nurses were often less knowledgeable around spiritual care under the Meaning and Hope factor of spiritual care than the Caring and Respecting factor (considered above), and this went on to impact their comfort with the delivery of spiritual care in specific domains (27).",
              "As well as considering the source of spiritual care education and the type of education which is covered, the individual participants in this training also warrant consideration.",
