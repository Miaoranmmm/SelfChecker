    "query": "What is the most effective way to improve public health literacy and promote health education, especially in underserved communities, and what strategies have been successful in achieving this goal?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Improving public health literacy and promoting health education are important goals for public health professionals and health educators. According to the CDC, health literacy is \"the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.\"[^2^]\n\nSome of the ways to improve public health literacy and promote health education are:\n\n- Creating and providing information and services that people can understand and use effectively with the skills they have. This includes using plain language, clear visuals, and appropriate formats for different audiences. See Develop and Test Materials[^2^].\n- Working with educators and others to help people become more familiar with health information and services and build their health literacy skills over time. This includes integrating health literacy into school curricula, adult education programs, and community-based initiatives. See Collaborate[^2^].\n- Building skills as communicators of health information. This includes using techniques such as teach-back, ask-me-3, motivational interviewing, and shared decision making to ensure that people understand and act on health information. See Find Training[^3^] for free, online courses on health literacy.\n- Working with trusted messengers to share health information. This includes engaging with community leaders, faith-based organizations, community health workers, peer educators, and other influencers who can reach underserved populations and address their cultural and linguistic needs. See Live Healthy in Faith [6.4 MB, 95 pages] guide[^2^] for ways to engage members of faith communities in sharing your messages. See Bridging the Gap[^2^] for ways in which community health workers (also known as promotores) serve as trusted messengers.\n- Building health-literate organizations. This includes adopting policies and practices that make it easier for people to access, understand, and use health information and services. See Attributes of a Health Literate Organization[^2^], Assess Health Literacy in Your Organization[^2^], Organizational Health Literacy: Quality Improvement Measures with Expert Consensus[^2^].\n\nSome of the strategies that have been successful in achieving these goals are:\n\n- Developing a national action plan for improving health literacy. The CDC's Health Literacy Action Plan[^1^] outlines six goals and strategies for advancing health literacy in public health practice, research, education, and policy.\n- Conducting research and evaluation on health literacy interventions. There is evidence that improving health literacy can lead to better health outcomes, lower costs, and reduced disparities. See Reports and Evidence on Limited Health Literacy[^2^] for some examples of studies on the impact of health literacy.\n- Creating partnerships and coalitions among stakeholders. Improving health literacy requires collaboration across sectors, disciplines, levels of government, and communities.

              "Education has been an essential component of action to promote health and prevent disease throughout this century.",
              "Campaigns to promote maternal and child health, to prevent communicable disease, and to promote immunization and other preventive health services have a long history.",
              "In developing countries, health education directed towards these goals remains a fundamental tool in the promotion of health and prevention of disease.",
              "In developed countries, during the 1960s and 1970s this early experience in health campaigning was directed towards the prevention of non-communicable disease by promoting healthy lifestyles.",
              "Many of these early campaigns were characterized by their emphasis on the transmission of information, and were based upon a relatively simplistic understanding of the relationship between communication and behaviour change.",
              "Over time, it became apparent that campaigns which focussed only on the transmission of information and failed to take account of the social and economic circumstances of individuals were not achieving the results which had been expected in terms of their impact on health behaviour.",
              "Many health education programs emerging during the 1970s were found to be effective only among the most educated and economically advantaged in the community.",
              "It was assumed that these groups had higher levels of education and literacy, personal skills and economic means to receive and respond to health messages communicated through traditional media.",
              "As a tool for disease prevention, health education was considerably strengthened by the development of a new generation of more sophisticated, theory-informed interventions during the 1980s.",
              "These programs focussed on the social context of behavioural decisions, and focussed on helping people to develop personal and social skills required to make positive health behaviour choices.",
              "This type of program was pioneered through school-based health education programs directed towards preventing teenage substance misuse, and subsequently has been applied in other settings (Glanz et al.",
              ", 1997).",
              "Several theories of behaviour change were developed during this period to guide educational programs. Examples include Azjen and Fishbein's theory of planned behaviour, and Bandura's social learning theory (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980;",
              "Bandura, 1986).",
              "These theories have helped to identify and explain the complex relationships between knowledge, beliefs and perceived social norms, and provide practical guidance on the content of educational programs to promote behavioural change in a given set of circumstances.",
              "During the same period, social marketing evolved as a technique for influencing social norms and behaviours in populations (Andreasen, 1995).",
              "Social marketing has encouraged creative approaches to the analysis of issues and the development of programs, especially in relation to the communication of information.",
              "As a consequence, health education programs have evolved in their sophistication, reach and relevance to a wider range of groups in populations.",
              "Despite this progress, interventions which have relied primarily on communication and education have mostly failed to achieve substantial and sustainable results in terms of behaviour change, and have made little impact in terms of closing the gap in health status between different social and economic groups in society.",
              "In the 19th century public health action resulted from a need to address the devastating effects of the living and working conditions imposed on populations during the industrial revolution.",
              "The initial focus of public health action was, therefore, on the social and environmental determinants of the health of the population.",
              "By the late 20th century, however, there had been a shift in the emphasis of public health action toward modifying individual risk behaviours.",
              "However, recent epidemiological analysis of health, disease and disability in the populations of most developed countries confirms the role of social, economic and environmental factors in determining increased risk of disease and adverse outcomes from disease (Townsend et al.",
              ", 1988;",

              "The relationships between these social factors and health, although easy to observe, are less well understood and much more difficult to act upon.",
              "Consequently they have been given much less attention as a basis for public health intervention than have individual behaviours in the recent past.",
              "As the effects on population health of economic, social and environmental policies adopted in developed nations in the late 20th century begin to emerge and are better understood, there has been renewed interest among public health practitioners in acting to influence these determinants of health.",
              "This renewed interest was reflected through the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (World Health Organization, 1986) and more recently confirmed in the Jakarta Declaration (World Health Organization, 1997).",

              "To take a concrete example, efforts to communicate to people the benefits of not smoking, in the absence of a wider set of measures to reinforce and sustain this healthy lifestyle choice, are doomed to failure.",
              "A more comprehensive approach is required which explicitly acknowledges social and environmental influences on lifestyle choices and addresses such influences alongside efforts to communicate with people.",
              "Thus, more comprehensive approaches to tobacco control are now adopted around the world.",
              "Alongside efforts to communicate the risks to health of tobacco use, these also include strategies to reduce demand through restrictions on promotion and increases in price, to reduce supply by restrictions on access (especially to minors), and to reflect social unacceptability through environmental bans.",
              "This more comprehensive approach is not only addressing the individual behaviour, but also some of the underlying social and environmental determinants of that behaviour.",
              "It is now well understood from experiences in addressing specific public health problems of tobacco control, injury prevention and pre-vention of illicit drug use, and the more general challenge of achieving greater equity in health, that education alone is generally insufficient to achieve major public health goals.",
              "As a result of the failings of educational programs in the past, the role of health education as a tool in the \u2018new public health\u2019 promoted by the Ottawa Charter has been somewhat downplayed.",
              "Health education has often been considered in a rather limited way as contributing only to improvements in individual knowledge and beliefs about risk factors for disease, and as having only a limited role in promoting behaviour change in relation to those risk factors.",
              "This may have had the unintended consequence of underestimating the role of health education, and fails to properly capture the potential of health education as a tool to support a full range of contemporary public health interventions.",

              "In the recent past, considerable attention has been given to analysing the determinants of health, and to the definition of outcomes associated with health promotion activity.",
              "This has led to the development hierarchies of \u2018outcomes\u2019 from health interventions, which illustrate and explain the linkages between health promotion actions, the determinants of health, and subsequent health outcomes.",

              "These include such outcomes as improved knowledge and understanding of health determinants, and changed attitudes and motivations in relation to health behaviour, as well as improved self-efficacy in relation to defined tasks.",

              "Success in the introduction of tobacco control legislation in many countries represents a contemporary example of an outcome from effective public health advocacy.",
              "The health promotion actions in the model include education for health, efforts to mobilize people's collective energy, resources, skills towards the improvement of health, and advocacy for health.",
              "A typical health promotion program might consist of interventions targeted at all three of the factors identified as health promotion outcomes above.",
              "For example, a program to promote healthy eating might consist of efforts to educate people about basic food groups, to develop practical skills in food preparation and selection, and different actions to improve access to healthier food choices through supply-side intervention.",
              "These could include, e.",
              "g. efforts to improve the food choices available in school and worksite canteens, and interventions with food retailers to improve the supply and promotion of healthier food choices.",
              "The different intervention strategies also mean that a wide range of potential measures of health promotion outcomes can be considered as evidence of success in the short term.",

              "Use of this model places health education and communication into the wider context of health promotion, and highlights health literacy as a key outcome from health education.",
              "In this context, how we define and measure health literacy is both dictated by and influential on the content and methods of health education.",
              "The term health literacy has been used in the health literature for at least 30 years (Ad Hoc Committee on Health Literacy, 1999).",
              "In the United States in particular the term is used to describe and explain the relationship between patient literacy levels and their ability to comply with prescribed therapeutic regimens (Ad Hoc Committee on Health Literacy, 1999).",
              "This approach infers that \u2018adequate functional health literacy means being able to apply literacy skills to health related materials such as prescriptions, appointment cards, medicine labels, and directions for home health care\u2019 (Parker et al.",
              ", 1995).",

              "However, this fundamental but somewhat narrow definition of health literacy misses much of the deeper meaning and purpose of literacy for people.",
              "The field of literacy studies is alive with debate about different \u2018types\u2019 of literacy and their practical application in everyday life.",
              "One approach to classification simply identifies types of literacy not as measures of achievement in reading and writing, but more in terms of what it is that literacy enables us to do (Freebody and Luke, 1990).",
              "Basic/functional literacy\u2014sufficient basic skills in reading and writing to be able to function effectively in everyday situations, broadly compatible with the narrow definition of \u2018health literacy\u2019 referred to above.",
              "Communicative/interactive literacy\u2014more advanced cognitive and literacy skills which, together with social skills, can be used to actively participate in everyday activities, to extract information and derive meaning from different forms of communication, and to apply new information to changing circumstances.",

              "Such a classification indicates that the different levels of literacy progressively allow for greater autonomy and personal empowerment.",
              "Progression between levels is not only dependent upon cognitive development, but also exposure to different information/messages (communication content and method).",
              "This, in turn, is influenced by variable personal responses to such communication\u2014which is mediated by personal and social skills, and self-efficacy in relation to defined issues.",
              "By contrast to the definition of functional health literacy above, WHO defines health literacy more broadly, as follows (Nutbeam, 1998).",
              "Health literacy represents the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health.",

              "By improving people's access to health information and their capacity to use it effectively, health literacy is critical to empowerment.",
              "Health literacy means more than being able to read pamphlets and successfully make appointments.",
              "By improving people's access to health information and their capacity to use it effectively, health literacy is critical to empowerment.",
              "This definition reflects elements of the two other types of literacy described above\u2014interactive and critical literacy.",
              "It also significantly broadens the scope of the content of health education and communication, indicates that health literacy may have both personal and social benefits, and has profound implications for education and communication methods.",
              "In terms of \u2018content\u2019, efforts to improve people's knowledge, understanding and capacity to act, should not only be directed at changing personal lifestyle or the way in which people use the health services.",
              "Health education could also raise awareness of the social, economic and environmental determinants of health, and be directed towards the promotion of individual and collective actions which may lead to modification of these determinants.",
              "In terms of \u2018health benefit\u2019, such a definition implies that health literacy is not only a personal resource which leads to personal benefits, e.",
              "g. healthier lifestyle choices and effective use of available health services.",
              "It also implies that the achievement of higher levels of health literacy among a greater proportion of the population will have social benefits, contributing, e.",

              "In terms of \u2018method of education\u2019 and communication, such a definition provides a challenge to communicate in ways that invite interaction, participation and critical analysis.",
              "This is very similar to the style of education for \u2018critical consciousness\u2019 advocated and popularized by the Brazilian educator, Paulo Freire (Freire, 1970).",
              "Health literacy is clearly dependent upon levels of fundamental literacy and associated cognitive development.",
              "Individuals with undeveloped skills in reading and writing will not only have less exposure to traditional health education, but also less developed skills to act upon the information received.",
              "For these reasons, strategies to promote health literacy will remain inextricably tied to more general strategies to promote literacy.",
              "But beyond this fundamental link between literacy and health literacy, much of the richness of health literacy implied by the WHO definition is missed in approaches to the promotion of functional health literacy as described above.",
              "Having emphasized this fundamental relationship, however, it is important to recognize that high literacy levels (assessed in terms of ability to read and write) are no guarantee that a person will respond in a desired way to health education and communication activities.",
              "By contrast, Freire, and those that have modelled their education programs on his methods (Wallerstein and Bernstein, 1988), have shown that working to raise the \u2018critical consciousness\u2019 of those with little or no skills in reading and writing can undertake activities and achieve outcomes which are closely aligned to the definition of critical literacy described above.",

              "Level 1, \u2018functional health literacy\u2019 reflects the outcome of traditional health education based on the communication of factual information on health risks, and on how to use the health system.",
              "Such action has limited goals directed towards improved knowledge of health risks and health services, and compliance with prescribed actions.",
              "Generally such activities will result in individual benefit, but may be directed towards population benefit (e.",
              "g. by promoting participation in immunization and screening programs).",
              "Typically such approaches do not invite interactive communication, nor do they foster skills development and autonomy.",

              "This is focussed on the development of personal skills in a supportive environment.",
              "This approach to education is directed towards improving personal capacity to act independently on knowledge, specifically to improving motivation and self-confidence to act on advice received.",
              "Again, much of this activity will result in individual benefit, rather than population benefit.",
              "Examples of this form of action can be found in many contemporary school health education programs directed towards personal and social skill development and behavioural outcomes.",
              "Level 3, \u2018critical health literacy\u2019 reflects the cognitive and skills development outcomes which are oriented towards supporting effective social and political action, as well as individual action.",
              "Within this paradigm, health education may involve the communication of information, and development of skills which investigate the political feasibility and organizational possibilities of various forms of action to address social, economic and environmental determinants of health.",
              "This type of health literacy can be more obviously linked to population benefit, alongside benefits to the individual.",
              "Health education in this case would be directed towards improving individual and community capacity to act on these social and economic determinants of health.",
              "Relating this interpretation of the term \u2018health literacy\u2019 to the outcome model in Figure 1 illustrates both lateral and vertical relationships between education, health literacy and the other health promotion outcomes.",
              "For example, on a vertical plane, improved health literacy may enable healthy lifestyle choices, and support effective use of health services, including compliance with treatment regimes.",
              "Laterally, educational programs directed at achieving critical health literacy will improve capacity for social action which may in turn be directed towards changing public policy and organizational practices related to health.",
              "Examples of this form of action can be found in many community development programs. Through this route health education can be directed towards achieving change in the social, economic and environmental determinants of health which may benefit the health of whole populations, alongside more typical programs directed at individual lifestyles and health system use.",
              "Health literacy is a concept that is both new and old.",

              "Disappointingly, the potential of education as a tool for social change, and for political action has been somewhat lost in contemporary health promotion.",
              "Close attention to the impact of public policy decisions on health, and the need to create supportive environments for health may have had the unintended consequence of leading to structural interventions \u2018on behalf\u2019 of people \u2014health promotion which is done \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018to\u2019 people, rather than \u2018by\u2019 or \u2018with\u2019 people.",
              "In turn, health education has been limited to interpersonal communication and media campaigns directed towards individual behavioural outcomes and health services use.",

              "Second, confirm understanding by using the teach-back method.",
              "We all think we\u2019re using plain language and being clear, but the only way to know for sure is to ask people to state what they heard in their own words.",
              "The teach-back method is also valuable in cross-cultural communication, as it may help identify language barriers and false cultural assumptions, such as presuming people are familiar with Western medicine or common medical concepts.",

              "When examining the question of whether and how HL affects health, researchers need to be mindful that literacy represents a resource which, for racial/ethnic minority subgroups, historically has been withheld to oppress, or has been measured and then used to judge groups as inferior or ineligible to participate as citizens, or as an alternate means to oppress (Goldman, 2004).",
              "There are several related challenges in HL research that researchers, policymakers, and practitioners must be aware of that temper confidence in the validity of the research and its synthesis just presented, and which support the need to carry out additional, complementary research to better approximate truth and not perpetuate mistruths.",

              "How best to measure patient HL, and whether or not HL measures are detecting true differences in capacities and skills in marginalized populations, can be problematic and controversial.",
              "A recent review of all HL research measures (Health Literacy Tool Shed, 2021) found that 200 unique measures have been created and employed, including 14 in Spanish, with most (52%) requiring paper and pencil responses, and some measures (12%) requiring more than 15 minutes to administer.",

              "Because conventional literacy assessments are bounded by cultural and linguistic assumptions derived from the majority population, more research is needed to assess patient HL in a comprehensive, holistic, and unbiased manner, and to expand the assessment of reliability and validity across subgroups of interest to avoid misattributing health disparities solely to limited HL.",
              "A clear, but by no means isolated example of this challenge is the use of HL measures that require proper pronunciation of medical terms to assess HL, such as the REALM (Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine).",
              "It is not hard to imagine that biased measurement may occur for a measure in which a White researcher scores a patient's HL by determining whether a patient has read and pronounced a medical term \u201ccorrectly.",

              "The critique here is both general to social epidemiology and specific to HL research.",
              "For example, do the observations that low HL is more common in marginalized populations, and that in some cases observed social disparities in health outcomes appear to be statistically mediated by low HL suggest that the relationship indeed is causal?",
              "There are alternative hypothesized mechanisms by which low HL may be associated with health care quality and health outcomes in research exploring the causes of health disparities among vulnerable populations that are not causal (Harris, 2010).",
              "These mechanisms include: When it comes to shedding light on the fundamental causes of health disparities, articulating mechanisms leading to health disparities, and intervening to promote health equity, HL research needs to evolve in many ways to achieve its promise.",
              "First, future research should focus on developing alternative HL measures that are not subject to bias and mismeasurement in marginalized populations and should attend to ensuring the reliability and validity of these measures across population subgroups.",

              "Second, because most HL research has focused on patients' HL deficits, much more work needs to be done to operationalize a measure of clinician or systems' responsiveness to the needs of populations with low HL, including the communication attributes of clinicians and health care organizations (Brach et al.",

              "During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and even to date, guidance on what precautions to take and what to do if you got sick was often difficult to understand, conflicting, and impractical for many people.",
              "For example, telling people with COVID-19 to isolate in their own bedroom and not share a bathroom with others didn\u2019t make sense to people living in crowded conditions.",
              "Disseminating information that doesn\u2019t account for people\u2019s life circumstances and cultural context can erode trust, especially for people who may be wary of unfamiliar sources of information.",
              "Such dynamics not only made it harder to manage the spread of coronavirus, but also provided openings for dangerous misinformation to compete with evidence-based health information.",
              "Make sure you share information from trusted, health literate sources.",
              "However, it can be hard to know what your audience considers to be a trusted source.",
              "A proven best practice is to leverage recognized community advocates to share accurate information with their communities in a culturally sensitive way.",
              "In 2014 and 2015, such insights changed the trajectory of the Ebola crisis in West Africa.",
              "The wide range of cultures across the region required diverse messaging strategies and tactics tailored to many different perspectives.",
              "Leaders with a deep cultural understanding of their communities ultimately shared critical information in ways that people in those communities could hear, understand, and act on \u2014 leading to the behavioral changes necessary to stop the spread of the virus.",
              "Second, confirm understanding by using the teach-back method.",
              "We all think we\u2019re using plain language and being clear, but the only way to know for sure is to ask people to state what they heard in their own words.",
              "The teach-back method is also valuable in cross-cultural communication, as it may help identify language barriers and false cultural assumptions, such as presuming people are familiar with Western medicine or common medical concepts.",
              "Third, gather colleagues to map out a joint health literacy plan \u2014 and commit to implementing it.",
              "Health literacy is a team sport and requires consistently applied systems-level approaches to address it.",
              "For example, improving health literacy requires communication training for staff, routinely assessing and revising written materials, reviewing facilities and systems to see if they\u2019re easy to navigate, and developing supports for people with limited health literacy that don\u2019t stigmatize them.",
              "Fortunately, you can address health literacy incrementally, starting with low-hanging-fruit strategies and working up to comprehensive initiatives until you\u2019ve made health literacy part of your organization\u2019s culture.",
              "Use a variety of available resources to make the job easier.",
