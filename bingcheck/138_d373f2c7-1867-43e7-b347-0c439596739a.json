    "query": "What is the most effective method for training and conditioning the human brain to enhance cognitive abilities, and how has this been applied in real-world scenarios such as education or workplace performance?",
    "response": "That's a great question. There is no definitive answer to what is the most effective method for brain training, but there are some general principles and techniques that have been supported by research. According to the search results, some of these are:\n\n- Practicing a new and challenging activity that forces you to think and learn and requires ongoing practice[^1^] [^2^] [^4^]. This can be anything from learning a musical instrument, a language, or a craft, to doing creative writing or painting. The key is to choose something that interests you and motivates you to improve.\n- Using both sides of your brain by engaging in activities that involve coordination, spatial reasoning, and creativity[^4^]. This can include juggling, origami, puzzles, or even using your non-dominant hand for daily tasks.\n- Meditating regularly to improve your attention, focus, and emotional regulation[^1^]. Meditation can also help you reframe negative thoughts and cope with stress better.\n- Using your memory more by recalling information without relying on external aids[^1^]. For example, you can try to memorize phone numbers, grocery lists, or directions instead of writing them down or using your phone. You can also use mnemonic devices or associations to help you remember things better.\n- Reading widely and deeply to expand your vocabulary, knowledge, and critical thinking skills[^1^]. Reading can also expose you to different perspectives and stimulate your imagination.\n- Using brain training apps that are designed to target specific cognitive domains such as memory, reasoning, speed of processing, and executive functions[^5^]. However, not all apps are equally effective or evidence-based, so you should look for ones that have been tested in clinical trials and validated by independent researchers.\n\nThese brain training methods have been applied in various real-world scenarios such as education or workplace performance. For example, some studies have found that:\n\n- Learning a musical instrument can enhance academic achievement, especially in math and reading[^2^].\n- Doing creative writing can improve communication skills, self-expression, and problem-solving abilities[^2^].\n- Meditating can reduce anxiety, depression, and burnout among students and teachers[^1^].\n- Using memory strategies can help older adults retain information better and delay cognitive decline[^1^].\n- Reading can improve empathy, social skills, and cultural awareness among diverse groups of people[^1^].\n- Using brain training apps can improve cognitive function and quality of life among older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia[^5^].\n\nI hope this answer helps you understand some of the benefits and applications of brain training. \ud83d\ude0a",

              "Those changes may help counteract age- and disease-related alterations and help to explain cognitive benefits and transfers, once their link with cognitive improvements has been clearly established33,57.",
              "Finally, the study suffers a selection bias, since the participants were all users of this app and were therefore most probably familiar with the use of smartphones and current technology.",
              "This has two consequences: first, older people who are less familiar with mobile technology might find this app less usable and therefore the adherence may be lower.",
              "Secondly, a recent study underlined the importance of digital devices use in delaying cognitive decline in the older adults58, thus the participants of this study may have already been benefiting from this phenomenon and thus functioning at a higher cognitive level than those who do not regularly use mobile technology.",
              "Despite these limitations, the results of this study support that even at old age (above 80 years old), participants are able to use CMG and to train and improve cognition through CMG.",
              "Although technological devices and medical-related apps cannot single-handedly improve cognitive decline, in the absence of effective, low-cost, and accessible treatments for cognitive and motivational deficits, these brain training apps could be greatly beneficial to public health.",
              "One salient aspect of the games is that they could be combined with automated evaluation and assessment of cognitive function16,59.",
              "Therefore, we strongly suggest that the evaluation of cognitive function for long-term follow-up should not be restricted to cross-sectional measurement (typically done only once per year) but should also include longitudinal measurement to evaluate subjects\u2019 learning abilities or cognitive abilities in general if there is no training in between the assessments15.",
              "In this context, the presented method could be an interesting complementary tool due to its potential to become widely available thanks to the growing use of mobile technology.",
              "Another positive aspect is that the cognitive training and follow-up with games on mobile can be also proposed to patients with limited mobility, or living to far to come on a regular basis to specialized centers60, and in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic61,62.",
              "While cognitive training app games have been shown to improve memory in older people with mild cognitive impairment63, further studies are needed to determine if technologies, such as apps, can decrease dementia risk in healthy subjects or slow down the progression of the disease in patients suffering from cognitive impairment and if there is a transfer to the activities of daily living.",
              "We can, also, speculate that since psychomotor slowing associated with aging has an important negative effect on multi-tasking activities of daily living, improving the processing speed could have a positive effect on the quality of life of the participants64.",

              "8 However, reducing or eliminating pain and discomfort is an understandable and natural tendency, so many mindfulness-based programs adopt a position of balancing the desire for change with an acceptance of the reality of uncomfortable experiences.",
              "8 The use of mindfulness meditation practices to reduce distress has been a feature of many Eastern philosophical traditions (eg, Buddhism) for hundreds of years,9 and have been increasingly used in Western medicine for well over 30 years.",
              "10\u201312 Meditation practices emerged from a body of Buddhist and other contemplative traditions that represent a complementary approach that joins psychological approaches to reduce stress and discomfort,13 including cognitive\u2013behavioral therapies and relaxation techniques.",

              "Mindfulness-based approaches are distinguished from other cognitive\u2013behavioral treatments in that cognitive behavioral therapy approaches focus on changing one\u2019s thoughts and behavior while mindfulness-based approaches focus on balancing desire for changed experiences with acceptance of the present moment.",

              "18 Regardless of the actual mechanism, ongoing mindfulness practice ensures familiarity with the techniques that are presumed to improve self-regulation, likely through a variety of channels.",
              "MBCT initially emerged as an effort to reduce the risk for depressive episodes by targeting maladaptive mood regulation.",
              "In the two decades since its introduction, MBCT has been extended to multiple applications for adults, including generalized anxiety disorder, treatment-resistant depressive disorder, cancer, suicidal behavior, and bipolar disorder.",

              "Stressors experienced in childhood and adolescence have been associated with maladaptive outcomes, including internalizing problems, externalizing behaviors, academic difficulties, and health risk behaviors.",

              "22 This picture is compounded with concern for minority youth, particularly those living in low-resource neighborhoods, who encounter a disproportionate share of stressors due to structural inequality.",
              "23,24 Minority youth are more likely to experience the death of a family member or friend, to have a relative with negative legal encounters (eg, arrested or jailed), to have to become a caretaker, and to be placed in the foster care system.",
              "24,25 Nevertheless, the effects of stress on coping and psychological functioning are important for all youth, as recurrent stressors may continuously tax an adolescent\u2019s native self-regulatory system.",
              "As recent work has shown that coping can temper the effects of stress on development of depressive symptoms over time in youth,24,26 interventions that enhance adolescents\u2019 abilities to cope effectively with inevitable stress may provide a protective effect against psychological difficulties.",

              "32\u201334 The psychological shift theorized to occur with mindfulness may contribute to improvements in associated cognitive, emotional, social, and behavioral domains (see Table 1 for examples).",
              "Cognitive information-processing models have been useful in explaining mindfulness mechanisms. In one of their earliest papers introducing the theoretical foundation for MBCT, Teasdale et al explain that \u201c\u2018central engine resources\u2019 are devoted to repetitive, \u2018ruminative,\u2019 information processing cycles motivated to the attainment of central personal goals, or intentions, that can be neither attained nor relinquished\u201d.",
              "18 The inability to strategically direct one\u2019s attention denotes a critical element of one\u2019s cognitive processing resources and is theoretically constrained here by emotional considerations of attachment to a particular outcome in a complex matrix of individual goals and desires.",
              "We have previously discussed7 the multiple ways by which an information-processing model18,35 might explain how mindfulness works to modify attentional and emotional self-regulation processes: 1) interrupting automatic, \u201cmindless\u201d habits and cognitive scripts associated with maladaptive behavior;",
              "2) changing an individual\u2019s relationship to his or her own memory activation (eg, neutrally observing a memory, rather than attempting to inhibit it, or reacting in an emotionally negative way);",
              "3) becoming desensitized to previous emotional triggers for behavior;",
              "and 4) developing increased attention to and awareness of one\u2019s own general cognitive and emotional processes.",

              "Although the present study contributes to memory training research and practice, several caveats deserve comment.",
              "First, the review only includes published research studies.",
              "It does not include programs conducted in clinical or other settings or unpublished research trials, although efforts were made to contact potential authors of unpublished studies which led to inclusion of one eligible study (McDougall et al.",

              "Funnel plots revealed minimal evidence of publication bias.",
              "Further, a large intervention study among adults younger than 60 years using strategies common in commercially available cognitive training programs found similar training effect sizes (Owen et al.",

              "Second, our inclusion criteria were stricter than previous studies of memory training.",
              "We felt justified in this because our criteria conform to published criteria for assessing psychological interventions (Weisz & Hawley, 2001), and because there is enough of a critical mass of memory training studies today we can afford to be selective.",
              "Another potential limitation is that, although the present analysis was limited to measures of memory exclusively, the measures are heterogeneous and reflect many types of memory (e.",

              "We might add that the type of text the child is reading is also expected to be a variable because reading material that exposes the child to a wider range of vocabulary should also benefit vocabulary growth.",
              "Related to this point, Pfost, Dorfler, and Artelt (2013) reported that time reading narratives was much more predictive of vocabulary than was time reading newspapers, magazines, comics, or nonfiction.",

              "Where outcome variables in other studies were constrained skills, such as word attack skills, one might not expect to find meaningful differences, especially for older or more skilled readers.",
              "Reading comprehension, on the other hand, is affected by different component skills through reading development.",
              "For very early readers, reading comprehension skill is largely a function of word reading or decoding skill.",
              "For more advanced readers, language comprehension skills make a more substantial contribution to reading comprehension.",
              "Because the components affecting reading comprehension scores differ in their contribution through development, longitudinal comparisons of reading comprehension skills may or may not show a Matthew effect.",
              "These challenges are compounded when combined measures of word reading and reading comprehension are used.",
              "Hence, it is possible that some previous studies have not found evidence to support the existence of a Matthew effect because the outcome measures were either developmentally constrained or were developmentally less constrained but were measured in age ranges before the effects would be expected to occur.",
              "This analysis would be supported by the meta-analysis of Pfost and colleagues (Pfost et al.",
              ", 2014), which suggested that there was less evidence for a Matthew effect for developmentally constrained variables such as decoding accuracy.",
              "In the case of the current study, reading would be expected to affect vocabulary growth after children are exposed to a large number of novel words through reading, beginning at about the third or fourth grade.",
              "This is the developmental point investigated in this study.",
              "Second, as discussed earlier, previous studies of a Matthew effect for vocabulary did not control for word-learning skills prior to formal reading instruction.",
              "Indeed, the results of the current study indicate that this variable has a significant effect on the rate of vocabulary growth in the years between the fourth and 10th grades.",
              "This may be another reason for the variable findings in previous studies.",
              "Third, the current study used developmental ability scores based on IRT to allow for meaningful comparisons between performance at different age groups, which was not true of previous studies of a Matthew effect for vocabulary.",
              "The rationale for the use of IRT-based scores was that they appear to have the best properties, such as an equal-appearing interval scale, for characterizing the growth of mental abilities.",

              "In the current study, the use of developmental ability scores did not result in a decline in variance, and thus did not prohibit our ability to detect an effect of word-reading ability on vocabulary growth.",

              "(1995) with respect to reading are due to the use of a reading composite score that includes word identification, pseudoword identification, and reading comprehension.",

              "Indeed, further examination of the data revealed that the effect of early word-reading ability on vocabulary was not uniform across different levels of initial word-reading ability.",
              "Instead, it would appear that the strong readers made greater vocabulary gains relative to the average and weak readers.",
              "In the language of the Matthew effect, the rich were getting richer due to their better reading, but the poor were not getting poorer due to their weak reading.",

              "(2008) also reported a Matthew effect that did not apply to both strong and weak readers although they reported asymmetry in the opposite direction, with students most at risk of reading disorders being more likely to fall behind in reading, whereas those least at risk not gaining with respect to typical readers.",
              "A different prediction of the Matthew effect model was being tested in this study, and this is likely to account for the difference in results.",
              "In the current study, several factors might account for this one-sided Matthew effect, with a nonuniform effect of word-reading skill on vocabulary growth across skill levels.",
              "The current study does not differentiate between these possibilities and, naturally, they are not mutually exclusive.",
              "The first possibility is that the gap in reading volume between strong and average readers is greater than the gap in reading volume between average and weak readers.",
              "The possibility that there are larger differences in reading volume between strong and average readers, compared to the differences between average and weak readers, is somewhat speculative.",
              "However, Cunningham (2005) discussed data indicating that, for independent reading in fifth-grade students, the absolute differences between avid and average readers (90th and 50th percentiles for reading volume) are greater than are the absolute differences between average and weak readers (50th and 10th percentile for reading volume).",
              "This would be consistent with the hypothesis that differences in reading experiences are not in a linear relationship with skill level.",
              "In addition to the amount of reading in which individual children engage, it may also be that the reading material selected by strong readers contains a greater degree of novel vocabulary than does the material assigned to, or selected by, average or weak readers.",
              "The second possibility is that students differ in the amount that they benefit from reading new words and that those individual differences are greatest between average and strong readers.",
              "There is evidence that children differ in their ability to derive word meanings from written contexts (Cain, Oakhill, & Elbro, 2003;",

              "McKeown, 1985).",

              "DeThorne, Petrill, Hayiou-Thomas, and Plomin (2005) reported that children with very low vocabulary scores had a higher heritability and a lower influence of shared environment, relative to children with less severe vocabulary deficits.",
              "Again, the possibility that these individual differences are greater between strong and average readers, compared to the differences between weak and average readers, is speculative.",
              "It is also possible that weak readers were provided with educational interventions for reading skill or vocabulary knowledge, which reduced the cumulative disadvantage effect for them.",
              "The current study does not include information about intervention history, so this is speculative.",
              "However, this data suggests that the combination of behaviors chosen by students, differences in the ability to learn from exposure to new words in text, and educational policies are not further disadvantaging weak readers, at least in terms of their vocabulary growth.",
              "For those who are concerned about the poor getting poorer, this is an encouraging finding.",
              "As with any nonexperimental design, these conclusions are based on associations rather than on stronger experimental evidence involving random assignment to independent variable treatment conditions.",
              "The limitation of an observational design, such as this study, is that other confounding variables may play a role in observed effects.",
              "One such confounder could be the initial vocabulary level.",
              "Children with better word-reading skills in the fourth grade are also likely to have better listening vocabulary, as was true of the participants in this study.",
              "As a result, our analysis incorporated a measure of kindergarten-listening vocabulary ability as a covariate.",
              "This analysis is possible, in part, because the current study analyzes data from a large longitudinal sample of 485 participants, which provides adequate statistical power.",
              "We can assume that this measure of vocabulary in kindergarten was largely unaffected by the child's reading experience, but would reflect the child's general vocabulary\u2013learning ability along with aspects of the child's environment that could be associated with individual differences in word learning.",
              "Thus, we can argue that the effects of fourth-grade reading ability on subsequent listening vocabulary are likely to be independent of the child's general vocabulary\u2013learning ability.",
              "Another limitation of the current study is the use of a linear model, which means that the vocabulary data between the fourth and 10th grades was fit using only a linear slope and intercept.",
              "However, the overall vocabulary scores between kindergarten and 10th grade suggest a curvilinear trend, and it is possible that the data might be better represented by a nonlinear model, but this would require data at more time points than is available with this data set.",
              "This means that the current analysis cannot address questions that are specific to acceleration or deceleration of vocabulary growth rate, but instead captures the primary feature of the growth trajectory, namely overall change through time.",
              "The purpose of the original longitudinal study was to answer questions regarding outcomes of children with language impairment.",
              "The oversampling of children with language and/or cognitive impairments could potentially have biased the results of the current study.",
              "However, this was accounted for with the use of weighted scores.",
              "The findings, therefore, apply to both children and adolescents who were language impaired and typically developing.",
              "The principal finding of this study is that fourth-grade reading-word skill was related to the rate of change in vocabulary growth between the fourth and 10th grades, controlling for preliterate vocabulary skill.",
              "We interpret measures of word reading in the fourth grade as being an indicator variable for a variety of reading-related activities occurring during and after the fourth grade, which would affect exposure to new words.",
              "The analysis controlled for vocabulary levels prior to formal reading instruction and used developmental scores based on IRT, addressing two potential limitations in studies of Matthew effects.",
              "Data in the current study was collected from a population-based sample, meaning that these findings apply to both readers who are typically developing and language impaired.",
              "Hence, the current study provides strong support for the existence of a Matthew effect between word-reading skill and vocabulary.",
              "It is significant that the magnitude of the effect on absolute vocabulary levels was found to be large.",
              "The effect seems to be driven by strong readers, rather than weak readers, an encouraging finding for those concerned about outcomes for weak readers.",

              "It could be argued that traditional clinical scales or scores would have been more effective in evaluating subjects\u2019 cognitive functioning;",
              "however, using the scores of the games to assess the course of the performance has been used in a previous study55.",
              "Furthermore, both of the scores of the CMG and processing speed have been shown to be good indicators of cognitive function16,19.",
              "In a recent study examining the effects of cognitive training on cognitive performance of healthy adults, the authors found that there was a transfer effect between the trained abilities and the instruments used only when the tests were similar to the trained situation (near effects).",
              "If the tests differed too much from the training tasks (far effects) no training effect was observed56.",
              "Therefore, using the scores of the games and the reaction times could be considered as a near-effect instrument/measure and quantification of the real transfer to daily activities is still needed.",
              "However, some studies did show a transfer to general cognitive function as tested byneuropsychological batteries for multiple cognitive domains11,16 and also demonstrated a protective effect in patients with MCI57.",
              "Those beneficial effects could be related to the multi-domains, novel and continuously challenging (self-adaptative) stimulation provided by most cognitive training apps, which has been shown to be superior to the routine mental activities of everyday life11.",
              "These challenging and unusual stimuli induce changes in brain activity and connectivity in areas that are known to be affected by aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",
              "Those changes may help counteract age- and disease-related alterations and help to explain cognitive benefits and transfers, once their link with cognitive improvements has been clearly established33,57.",
              "Finally, the study suffers a selection bias, since the participants were all users of this app and were therefore most probably familiar with the use of smartphones and current technology.",
              "This has two consequences: first, older people who are less familiar with mobile technology might find this app less usable and therefore the adherence may be lower.",
              "Secondly, a recent study underlined the importance of digital devices use in delaying cognitive decline in the older adults58, thus the participants of this study may have already been benefiting from this phenomenon and thus functioning at a higher cognitive level than those who do not regularly use mobile technology.",
              "Despite these limitations, the results of this study support that even at old age (above 80 years old), participants are able to use CMG and to train and improve cognition through CMG.",
              "Although technological devices and medical-related apps cannot single-handedly improve cognitive decline, in the absence of effective, low-cost, and accessible treatments for cognitive and motivational deficits, these brain training apps could be greatly beneficial to public health.",
              "One salient aspect of the games is that they could be combined with automated evaluation and assessment of cognitive function16,59.",
              "Therefore, we strongly suggest that the evaluation of cognitive function for long-term follow-up should not be restricted to cross-sectional measurement (typically done only once per year) but should also include longitudinal measurement to evaluate subjects\u2019 learning abilities or cognitive abilities in general if there is no training in between the assessments15.",
              "In this context, the presented method could be an interesting complementary tool due to its potential to become widely available thanks to the growing use of mobile technology.",
              "Another positive aspect is that the cognitive training and follow-up with games on mobile can be also proposed to patients with limited mobility, or living to far to come on a regular basis to specialized centers60, and in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic61,62.",
              "While cognitive training app games have been shown to improve memory in older people with mild cognitive impairment63, further studies are needed to determine if technologies, such as apps, can decrease dementia risk in healthy subjects or slow down the progression of the disease in patients suffering from cognitive impairment and if there is a transfer to the activities of daily living.",
              "We can, also, speculate that since psychomotor slowing associated with aging has an important negative effect on multi-tasking activities of daily living, improving the processing speed could have a positive effect on the quality of life of the participants64.",

              "In another study the investigators analyzed the effect of a 20-session training program using an n-back task program (same principle as the Rush Back where the subjects must remember the previous card) in younger, middle-aged and older adults47.",
              "The authors found that age exerted independent effects on training gains and asymptotic performance: older adults tended to show less improvement in scores than younger adults47, which is also consistent with our findings.",
              "There are three main limitations in this study: the first is that we did not have access to any information about the background of the participants: it is well-known that several factors influence cognitive function and the risk of dementia such as genetic risk factors48, as well as non-genetic risk factors including lifestyle-related factors49, for example education level, smoking history, history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, physical activity, body mass index, or concomitant pathologies such as stroke50, cardiovascular disease51, diabetes52, or chronic respiratory disease53.",
              "Gender is also postulated to influence some cognitive functions such as vocabulary capacity54.",
              "Due to the fact that we did not have access to this background information, we cannot establish whether the effects observed in the current study were influenced by any of these factors.",
              "Most probably, subjects playing with this kind of app are cognitively healthy and quite comfortable with mobile devices.",
              "The second limitation is the choice of the outcomes, namely, the scores of the CMG and the processing speed data obtained within the games.",
              "It could be argued that traditional clinical scales or scores would have been more effective in evaluating subjects\u2019 cognitive functioning;",
              "however, using the scores of the games to assess the course of the performance has been used in a previous study55.",
              "Furthermore, both of the scores of the CMG and processing speed have been shown to be good indicators of cognitive function16,19.",
              "In a recent study examining the effects of cognitive training on cognitive performance of healthy adults, the authors found that there was a transfer effect between the trained abilities and the instruments used only when the tests were similar to the trained situation (near effects).",
              "If the tests differed too much from the training tasks (far effects) no training effect was observed56.",
              "Therefore, using the scores of the games and the reaction times could be considered as a near-effect instrument/measure and quantification of the real transfer to daily activities is still needed.",
              "However, some studies did show a transfer to general cognitive function as tested byneuropsychological batteries for multiple cognitive domains11,16 and also demonstrated a protective effect in patients with MCI57.",
              "Those beneficial effects could be related to the multi-domains, novel and continuously challenging (self-adaptative) stimulation provided by most cognitive training apps, which has been shown to be superior to the routine mental activities of everyday life11.",
              "These challenging and unusual stimuli induce changes in brain activity and connectivity in areas that are known to be affected by aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",
              "Those changes may help counteract age- and disease-related alterations and help to explain cognitive benefits and transfers, once their link with cognitive improvements has been clearly established33,57.",
              "Finally, the study suffers a selection bias, since the participants were all users of this app and were therefore most probably familiar with the use of smartphones and current technology.",
              "This has two consequences: first, older people who are less familiar with mobile technology might find this app less usable and therefore the adherence may be lower.",
              "Secondly, a recent study underlined the importance of digital devices use in delaying cognitive decline in the older adults58, thus the participants of this study may have already been benefiting from this phenomenon and thus functioning at a higher cognitive level than those who do not regularly use mobile technology.",
              "Despite these limitations, the results of this study support that even at old age (above 80 years old), participants are able to use CMG and to train and improve cognition through CMG.",
              "Although technological devices and medical-related apps cannot single-handedly improve cognitive decline, in the absence of effective, low-cost, and accessible treatments for cognitive and motivational deficits, these brain training apps could be greatly beneficial to public health.",
              "One salient aspect of the games is that they could be combined with automated evaluation and assessment of cognitive function16,59.",
              "Therefore, we strongly suggest that the evaluation of cognitive function for long-term follow-up should not be restricted to cross-sectional measurement (typically done only once per year) but should also include longitudinal measurement to evaluate subjects\u2019 learning abilities or cognitive abilities in general if there is no training in between the assessments15.",
              "In this context, the presented method could be an interesting complementary tool due to its potential to become widely available thanks to the growing use of mobile technology.",
              "Another positive aspect is that the cognitive training and follow-up with games on mobile can be also proposed to patients with limited mobility, or living to far to come on a regular basis to specialized centers60, and in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic61,62.",
              "While cognitive training app games have been shown to improve memory in older people with mild cognitive impairment63, further studies are needed to determine if technologies, such as apps, can decrease dementia risk in healthy subjects or slow down the progression of the disease in patients suffering from cognitive impairment and if there is a transfer to the activities of daily living.",
              "We can, also, speculate that since psychomotor slowing associated with aging has an important negative effect on multi-tasking activities of daily living, improving the processing speed could have a positive effect on the quality of life of the participants64.",

              "We identified 18 computerised brain training programs available across the world that were marketed with scientific claims. Of these, only seven programs (less than 40%) had been assessed by peer-reviewed studies that reported formal outcome measures of the programs on specific cognitive domains such as memory, reasoning, processing speed and executive functions.",

              "This process included an examination of the quantity and quality of the clinical trial applied in each instance.",
              "Programs in this category had at least two well-designed randomised controlled trials, one of which was of high-quality design.",
              "Two brain training programs met these criteria (BrainHQ and Cognifit).",

              "Our findings indicate some computerised brain training programs are backed by evidence in their claim to assist in promoting healthy brain ageing.",
              "However, such programs must be further validated using brain imaging methods to investigate their mechanism of action.",
              "Brain training programs feature different exercises that particularly target specific cognitive domains such as memory, reasoning, speed of processing, and executive functions.",
              "Effective exercises are mostly designed on the principle of the brain\u2019s capability to rewire and reconnect \u2013 the neuroplasticity principle.",

              "Some features to look for in deciding whether a program is right for you include: the program is recommended for your specific purpose \u2013 for example, healthy brain ageing, rehabilitation, learning and concentration the program is scientifically validated the program is adaptive and engaging the program is continuously challenging the program features audio and/or is visually interactive the program provides feedback about your progress.",
              "Programs that train the brain to be more responsive using specific tasks and increasing levels of difficulties are thought to help rewire neural pathways according to the neuroplasticity principle.",
              "In our review process, we identified 18 brain training programs. Of these, 11 had no clinical trials or empirical evidence to indicate they were effective in promoting healthy brain ageing.",
              "To spot the programs without adequate evidence, one option is to go to the program\u2019s website and identify whether the company provides links to specific studies relevant to your purposes.",
              "Most of the websites provide only supportive evidence \u2013 that is, they do not refer to specific clinical trials, but instead quote the principles of the brain\u2019s ability to rewire or reconnect, or cite studies that used other programs. Very few have a list of studies that directly measured the impact of the program in question.",
              "Findings from studies that are randomised, double-blinded (both the investigator and the user don\u2019t know if the intervention is real or only a placebo) and have a control group that meets the gold standard of clinical trials are more reliable than non-randomised trials without any control conditions.",
              "However, evidence concerning how or where these software programs affect plasticity in brain cells or connections within the brain is lacking.",
              "Assessments using specific biological markers of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (or other neurodegenerative diseases) such as blood and brain imaging would considerably enhance clinical validation of brain training programs. This would also enable greater understanding of the connection between computerised brain exercises and human cognition, and provide an insight into new therapeutic pathways.",
              "It\u2019s possible computerised exercises that are adaptable and continuously challenging may help the brain to rewire lost connections that are linked with dementia later in life.",
              "At the moment, however, there is little evidence computerised brain training programs can help prevent dementia onset.",
              "Thus, more longitudinal follow-up studies are required.",
              "Regardless of whether new neural pathways are established, some mental exercises may work simply by increasing the blood circulation in the brain, similar to physical exercise.",
              "Thus, healthy brain ageing may be achieved by maintaining or improving cognitive functions via avenues such as brain training, but also through social interaction, exercise, diet and other lifestyle strategies.",

              "however, using the scores of the games to assess the course of the performance has been used in a previous study55.",
              "Furthermore, both of the scores of the CMG and processing speed have been shown to be good indicators of cognitive function16,19.",
              "In a recent study examining the effects of cognitive training on cognitive performance of healthy adults, the authors found that there was a transfer effect between the trained abilities and the instruments used only when the tests were similar to the trained situation (near effects).",
              "If the tests differed too much from the training tasks (far effects) no training effect was observed56.",
              "Therefore, using the scores of the games and the reaction times could be considered as a near-effect instrument/measure and quantification of the real transfer to daily activities is still needed.",
              "However, some studies did show a transfer to general cognitive function as tested byneuropsychological batteries for multiple cognitive domains11,16 and also demonstrated a protective effect in patients with MCI57.",
              "Those beneficial effects could be related to the multi-domains, novel and continuously challenging (self-adaptative) stimulation provided by most cognitive training apps, which has been shown to be superior to the routine mental activities of everyday life11.",
              "These challenging and unusual stimuli induce changes in brain activity and connectivity in areas that are known to be affected by aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",
              "Those changes may help counteract age- and disease-related alterations and help to explain cognitive benefits and transfers, once their link with cognitive improvements has been clearly established33,57.",
              "Finally, the study suffers a selection bias, since the participants were all users of this app and were therefore most probably familiar with the use of smartphones and current technology.",
              "This has two consequences: first, older people who are less familiar with mobile technology might find this app less usable and therefore the adherence may be lower.",
              "Secondly, a recent study underlined the importance of digital devices use in delaying cognitive decline in the older adults58, thus the participants of this study may have already been benefiting from this phenomenon and thus functioning at a higher cognitive level than those who do not regularly use mobile technology.",
              "Despite these limitations, the results of this study support that even at old age (above 80 years old), participants are able to use CMG and to train and improve cognition through CMG.",
              "Although technological devices and medical-related apps cannot single-handedly improve cognitive decline, in the absence of effective, low-cost, and accessible treatments for cognitive and motivational deficits, these brain training apps could be greatly beneficial to public health.",
              "One salient aspect of the games is that they could be combined with automated evaluation and assessment of cognitive function16,59.",
              "Therefore, we strongly suggest that the evaluation of cognitive function for long-term follow-up should not be restricted to cross-sectional measurement (typically done only once per year) but should also include longitudinal measurement to evaluate subjects\u2019 learning abilities or cognitive abilities in general if there is no training in between the assessments15.",
              "In this context, the presented method could be an interesting complementary tool due to its potential to become widely available thanks to the growing use of mobile technology.",
              "Another positive aspect is that the cognitive training and follow-up with games on mobile can be also proposed to patients with limited mobility, or living to far to come on a regular basis to specialized centers60, and in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic61,62.",
              "While cognitive training app games have been shown to improve memory in older people with mild cognitive impairment63, further studies are needed to determine if technologies, such as apps, can decrease dementia risk in healthy subjects or slow down the progression of the disease in patients suffering from cognitive impairment and if there is a transfer to the activities of daily living.",
              "We can, also, speculate that since psychomotor slowing associated with aging has an important negative effect on multi-tasking activities of daily living, improving the processing speed could have a positive effect on the quality of life of the participants64.",

              "The authors found that age exerted independent effects on training gains and asymptotic performance: older adults tended to show less improvement in scores than younger adults47, which is also consistent with our findings.",
              "There are three main limitations in this study: the first is that we did not have access to any information about the background of the participants: it is well-known that several factors influence cognitive function and the risk of dementia such as genetic risk factors48, as well as non-genetic risk factors including lifestyle-related factors49, for example education level, smoking history, history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, physical activity, body mass index, or concomitant pathologies such as stroke50, cardiovascular disease51, diabetes52, or chronic respiratory disease53.",
              "Gender is also postulated to influence some cognitive functions such as vocabulary capacity54.",
              "Due to the fact that we did not have access to this background information, we cannot establish whether the effects observed in the current study were influenced by any of these factors.",
              "Most probably, subjects playing with this kind of app are cognitively healthy and quite comfortable with mobile devices.",
              "The second limitation is the choice of the outcomes, namely, the scores of the CMG and the processing speed data obtained within the games.",
              "It could be argued that traditional clinical scales or scores would have been more effective in evaluating subjects\u2019 cognitive functioning;",
              "however, using the scores of the games to assess the course of the performance has been used in a previous study55.",
              "Furthermore, both of the scores of the CMG and processing speed have been shown to be good indicators of cognitive function16,19.",
              "In a recent study examining the effects of cognitive training on cognitive performance of healthy adults, the authors found that there was a transfer effect between the trained abilities and the instruments used only when the tests were similar to the trained situation (near effects).",
              "If the tests differed too much from the training tasks (far effects) no training effect was observed56.",
              "Therefore, using the scores of the games and the reaction times could be considered as a near-effect instrument/measure and quantification of the real transfer to daily activities is still needed.",
              "However, some studies did show a transfer to general cognitive function as tested byneuropsychological batteries for multiple cognitive domains11,16 and also demonstrated a protective effect in patients with MCI57.",
              "Those beneficial effects could be related to the multi-domains, novel and continuously challenging (self-adaptative) stimulation provided by most cognitive training apps, which has been shown to be superior to the routine mental activities of everyday life11.",
              "These challenging and unusual stimuli induce changes in brain activity and connectivity in areas that are known to be affected by aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",
              "Those changes may help counteract age- and disease-related alterations and help to explain cognitive benefits and transfers, once their link with cognitive improvements has been clearly established33,57.",
              "Finally, the study suffers a selection bias, since the participants were all users of this app and were therefore most probably familiar with the use of smartphones and current technology.",
              "This has two consequences: first, older people who are less familiar with mobile technology might find this app less usable and therefore the adherence may be lower.",
              "Secondly, a recent study underlined the importance of digital devices use in delaying cognitive decline in the older adults58, thus the participants of this study may have already been benefiting from this phenomenon and thus functioning at a higher cognitive level than those who do not regularly use mobile technology.",
              "Despite these limitations, the results of this study support that even at old age (above 80 years old), participants are able to use CMG and to train and improve cognition through CMG.",
              "Although technological devices and medical-related apps cannot single-handedly improve cognitive decline, in the absence of effective, low-cost, and accessible treatments for cognitive and motivational deficits, these brain training apps could be greatly beneficial to public health.",
              "One salient aspect of the games is that they could be combined with automated evaluation and assessment of cognitive function16,59.",
              "Therefore, we strongly suggest that the evaluation of cognitive function for long-term follow-up should not be restricted to cross-sectional measurement (typically done only once per year) but should also include longitudinal measurement to evaluate subjects\u2019 learning abilities or cognitive abilities in general if there is no training in between the assessments15.",
              "In this context, the presented method could be an interesting complementary tool due to its potential to become widely available thanks to the growing use of mobile technology.",
              "Another positive aspect is that the cognitive training and follow-up with games on mobile can be also proposed to patients with limited mobility, or living to far to come on a regular basis to specialized centers60, and in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic61,62.",
              "While cognitive training app games have been shown to improve memory in older people with mild cognitive impairment63, further studies are needed to determine if technologies, such as apps, can decrease dementia risk in healthy subjects or slow down the progression of the disease in patients suffering from cognitive impairment and if there is a transfer to the activities of daily living.",
              "We can, also, speculate that since psychomotor slowing associated with aging has an important negative effect on multi-tasking activities of daily living, improving the processing speed could have a positive effect on the quality of life of the participants64.",

              "\u201cStudents who participated in music, who had higher achievement in music, and who were highly engaged in music had higher exam scores across all subjects, while these associations were more pronounced for those who took instrumental music rather than vocal music,\u201d he said.",
              "\u201cOn average, the children who learned to play a musical instrument for many years, and were now playing in high school band and orchestra, were the equivalent of about one academic year ahead of their peers with regard to their English, mathematics and science skills, as measured by their exam grades.",

              "\u201cWe think that the effects we see are partly a result of the fact that children engaging in school music over many years mostly receive quality music instruction and need to master the high expectations of performing at a high school band or orchestra level.",
              "In fact, it is that high levels of music engagement for which we saw the strongest effects.",
              "\u201d The researchers hope that their findings are brought to the attention of students, parents, teachers and administrative decision-makers in education, as many school districts over the years have emphasized numeracy and literacy at the cost of other areas of learning, particularly music.",

              "The findings are considered in relation to the possible reasons for this, and the implications for education.",
              "There is a growing body of international evidence relating to the impact of active engagement with music on attainment in school.",
              "However, there is relatively little evidence from schools in the UK.",
              "Much of the existing research is based on correlation analysis which precludes the demonstration of causality, particularly as there are many possible confounding factors including having supportive parents and a home environment conducive to studying.",

              "Schellenberg, Reference SCHELLENBERG and McPherson2014).",
              "The testing and examination system in place in the UK at the time of the research meant that it was possible to take prior attainment into account as national tests and examinations were undertaken by the children participating in the research at ages 11 and 16.",
              "The evidence from correlation studies in the USA has shown that students who participate in music education do better than their peers on many measures of academic achievement.",
              "For instance, using state-wide data, Abeles (Reference ABELES2007) reported that groups of second grade children who participated in a weekly violin programme (three lessons every two weeks) outperformed non-violin group controls in performance on mathematics and language arts tests.",
              "Morrison (Reference MORRISON1994), using data from the National Centre for Educational Statistics representing over 13,000 students, showed that high school students who participated in music reported higher grades in English, mathematics, history, and science than those who did not participate.",
              "Similar outcomes have been reported by Trent (Reference TRENT1996), Cardarelli (Reference CARDARELLI2003) and Fitzpatrick (Reference FITZPATRICK2006).",
              "Johnson and Memmott (Reference JOHNSON and MEMMOTT2006), in a study in four regions including 4,739 elementary and middle school students, showed a strong relationship between third- and fourth-grade students\u2019 academic achievement and their participation in music programmes.",
              "This was moderated by the quality of the programme;",
              "the higher the quality of the programme, the higher the academic attainment.",
              "Research based on standardized verbal and mathematics achievement tests in the USA has shown that children who have participated in music courses while in high school perform better with the number of years engaged in music correlated with test performance (Catterall, Reference CATTERALL1998).",
              "Those young musicians who participate in state wide ensembles also have higher SAT scores than state averages (DeCarbo, Fiese & Boyle, Reference DE CARBO, FIESE and BOYLE1990;",
              "Henry & Braucht, Reference HENRY and BRAUCHT2007).",
              "Schellenberg (Reference SCHELLENBERG2006) also showed that music training was associated positively with children's performance in school and that those who took music lessons over relatively long periods of time tended to be particularly successfully even when intelligence was controlled for.",
              "However, not all of the research supports these findings.",
              "Miksza (Reference MIKSZA2007), using data from National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 with a sample of 5335, created a composite item which assessed student participation in music for the entire duration of the study from eighth to 12th grade and measured academic achievement in mathematics, reading comprehension, science and social studies.",
              "There were significant differences for all subtests in the initial testing in favour of those who had participated in band, choir or orchestra, but rates of change in mathematics, science and social studies were no greater for the music participants.",
              "Indeed, in reading achievement the music participants increased more slowly than non-participants.",
              "In a later study Miszka (Reference MIKSZA2010) using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, taking account of a wider range of variables studied the impact of musical engagement on standardized mathematics scores and found that students in high-school music ensembles were more likely to have higher standardised mathematics achievement scores.",
              "Also in the USA, Southgate and Roscigno (Reference SOUTHGATE and ROSCIGNO2009) \u2013 using two national data sets, ECLS-K (20,000 US kindergarten students) and NELS:88 (25,000 adolescents), and three measures of music participation (in school, outside school and parental involvement in the form of concert attendance) \u2013 found that music involvement varied systematically by class and gender status.",
              "Involvement had implications for both mathematics and reading achievement for young children and adolescents and associations between music and achievement persisted even when prior achievement was taken into account.",
              "Musical engagement generally increased achievement levels, although gains were not distributed equally among all students;",
              "a white student advantage existed.",
              "A study in Germany by Hille and Schupp (Reference HILLE and SCHUPP2013) used the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) longitudinal data to establish the impact of musical training on attainment.",
              "The database includes a detailed assessment of the intensity and duration of music activities for representative youth cohorts, and a variety of outcomes including school results.",
              "As it is a household rather than an individual survey it allows consideration of a wide range of parental characteristics.",
              "The findings on attainment at age 17, taking account of a wide range of individual and family characteristics, showed that children playing an instrument from age eight to 17 and having taken lessons outside school scored one-sixth of a standard deviation higher than children not playing an instrument.",
              "There is also evidence of the impact of active engagement with music on attainment from El Sistema, and Sistema inspired projects.",
              "In a programme in Chile, Egan\u0303a de Sol (Reference EGAN\u0303A DE SOL2008) showed a positive effect on academic attainment in verbal and mathematics skills.",
              "This was attributed in part to participants holding higher expectations of their academic achievements, although evaluations of other programmes in Chile had mixed results, with some programmes having positive results and others no impact (Evaluacio\u0301n de impacto programa orquestas juveniles e infantiles, 2010).",
              "Programmes in the USA have indicated increased academic attainment as an outcome of participation with more children achieving roll of honour status particularly where children participated for an extended period of time (Creech et al.",
              ", Reference CREECH, GONZALEZ-MORENO, LORENZINO and WAITMAN2013).",
              "In the UK, where Sistema-inspired programmes focus on children in primary schools in deprived areas, Smithhurst (Reference SMITHURST2011) reported that after one year of participation in the programme, children in Years 1\u20134 (aged 5\u20139) in one school were achieving better scores in mathematics, reading and writing compared with their peers who were not involved.",
              "90 per cent of the children were reaching target grades in mathematics compared with 68 per cent not involved in the programme.",
              "Similar trends were evident in reading with 85 per cent of programme children reaching target grades compared with 62 per cent not in the programme, and in writing, 65 per cent compared with 45 per cent.",
              "Burns and Bewick (Reference BURNS and BEWICK2011) reported that after two years of participating in the programme where children engaged with music for 4.",
              "5 hours per week, 43 per cent of the children had progressed more than four levels in mathematics, 53 per cent in reading, and 42 per cent in writing, compared with a national average of three levels, despite the fact that the participants included a high proportion of children with special educational needs.",
              "However, the rate of improvement slowed as participation continued.",
              "There have been a small number of experimental studies on the effects of participation in music on general attainment.",
              "The findings have been mixed.",

              "Hines (Reference HINES2000), studying students with learning difficulties from kindergarten through to ninth grade, found neither reading nor mathematics achievement was affected by type of music instruction, motoric or non-motoric.",
              "Legette (Reference LEGETTE1993) also found no effect of music instruction.",
              "Schneider and Klotz (Reference SCHNEIDER and KLOTZ2000) compared the impact of enrolment in music performance classes or athletic extracurricular activities on academic achievement and found that all groups were equivalent in the fifth and sixth grade but during the seventh, eighth and ninth grades the musicians achieved significantly higher academic achievement scores than the athletes but not than non-participant controls.",
              "In the UK, national testing of children's attainment at age 11 and national examinations at age 16 provide the opportunity for an objective assessment of the role of playing a musical instrument on progress and final outcomes.",
              "The aim of the current study is to explore whether students learning to play a musical instrument have enhanced achievement at age 16 in performance on UK national examinations taking into account their performance on national tests at age 11.",
              "The specific research questions are: 1) Does playing a musical instrument enhance performance on examinations at age 16?",
              "2) Does the length of time playing a musical instrument impact on performance on examinations at age 16?",
              "This study draws on existing data from three secondary schools in a large English Local Authority.",
              "The results of students in the General Certificate of School Education, a national examination taken at age 16, were used to assess attainment.",
              "This included the number of subjects taken, the average point score obtained, the total score point obtained, and the capped score obtained when performance in the best eight subjects was taken into account.",
              "The children's scores in mathematics and English on national tests taken at age 11 were also collected, and data on whether they played a musical instrument and how long they had been playing for.",

              "But fiction has at least three advantages.",
              "We have access to the character\u2019s interior world in a way we normally do not with journalism, and we are more likely to willingly suspend disbelief without questioning the veracity of what people are saying.",

              "In another study the investigators analyzed the effect of a 20-session training program using an n-back task program (same principle as the Rush Back where the subjects must remember the previous card) in younger, middle-aged and older adults47.",
              "The authors found that age exerted independent effects on training gains and asymptotic performance: older adults tended to show less improvement in scores than younger adults47, which is also consistent with our findings.",
              "There are three main limitations in this study: the first is that we did not have access to any information about the background of the participants: it is well-known that several factors influence cognitive function and the risk of dementia such as genetic risk factors48, as well as non-genetic risk factors including lifestyle-related factors49, for example education level, smoking history, history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, physical activity, body mass index, or concomitant pathologies such as stroke50, cardiovascular disease51, diabetes52, or chronic respiratory disease53.",
              "Gender is also postulated to influence some cognitive functions such as vocabulary capacity54.",
              "Due to the fact that we did not have access to this background information, we cannot establish whether the effects observed in the current study were influenced by any of these factors.",
              "Most probably, subjects playing with this kind of app are cognitively healthy and quite comfortable with mobile devices.",
              "The second limitation is the choice of the outcomes, namely, the scores of the CMG and the processing speed data obtained within the games.",
              "It could be argued that traditional clinical scales or scores would have been more effective in evaluating subjects\u2019 cognitive functioning;",
              "however, using the scores of the games to assess the course of the performance has been used in a previous study55.",
              "Furthermore, both of the scores of the CMG and processing speed have been shown to be good indicators of cognitive function16,19.",
              "In a recent study examining the effects of cognitive training on cognitive performance of healthy adults, the authors found that there was a transfer effect between the trained abilities and the instruments used only when the tests were similar to the trained situation (near effects).",
              "If the tests differed too much from the training tasks (far effects) no training effect was observed56.",
              "Therefore, using the scores of the games and the reaction times could be considered as a near-effect instrument/measure and quantification of the real transfer to daily activities is still needed.",
              "However, some studies did show a transfer to general cognitive function as tested byneuropsychological batteries for multiple cognitive domains11,16 and also demonstrated a protective effect in patients with MCI57.",
              "Those beneficial effects could be related to the multi-domains, novel and continuously challenging (self-adaptative) stimulation provided by most cognitive training apps, which has been shown to be superior to the routine mental activities of everyday life11.",
              "These challenging and unusual stimuli induce changes in brain activity and connectivity in areas that are known to be affected by aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",
              "Those changes may help counteract age- and disease-related alterations and help to explain cognitive benefits and transfers, once their link with cognitive improvements has been clearly established33,57.",
              "Finally, the study suffers a selection bias, since the participants were all users of this app and were therefore most probably familiar with the use of smartphones and current technology.",
              "This has two consequences: first, older people who are less familiar with mobile technology might find this app less usable and therefore the adherence may be lower.",
              "Secondly, a recent study underlined the importance of digital devices use in delaying cognitive decline in the older adults58, thus the participants of this study may have already been benefiting from this phenomenon and thus functioning at a higher cognitive level than those who do not regularly use mobile technology.",
              "Despite these limitations, the results of this study support that even at old age (above 80 years old), participants are able to use CMG and to train and improve cognition through CMG.",
              "Although technological devices and medical-related apps cannot single-handedly improve cognitive decline, in the absence of effective, low-cost, and accessible treatments for cognitive and motivational deficits, these brain training apps could be greatly beneficial to public health.",
              "One salient aspect of the games is that they could be combined with automated evaluation and assessment of cognitive function16,59.",
              "Therefore, we strongly suggest that the evaluation of cognitive function for long-term follow-up should not be restricted to cross-sectional measurement (typically done only once per year) but should also include longitudinal measurement to evaluate subjects\u2019 learning abilities or cognitive abilities in general if there is no training in between the assessments15.",
              "In this context, the presented method could be an interesting complementary tool due to its potential to become widely available thanks to the growing use of mobile technology.",
              "Another positive aspect is that the cognitive training and follow-up with games on mobile can be also proposed to patients with limited mobility, or living to far to come on a regular basis to specialized centers60, and in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic61,62.",
              "While cognitive training app games have been shown to improve memory in older people with mild cognitive impairment63, further studies are needed to determine if technologies, such as apps, can decrease dementia risk in healthy subjects or slow down the progression of the disease in patients suffering from cognitive impairment and if there is a transfer to the activities of daily living.",
              "We can, also, speculate that since psychomotor slowing associated with aging has an important negative effect on multi-tasking activities of daily living, improving the processing speed could have a positive effect on the quality of life of the participants64.",

              "In another study the investigators analyzed the effect of a 20-session training program using an n-back task program (same principle as the Rush Back where the subjects must remember the previous card) in younger, middle-aged and older adults47.",
              "The authors found that age exerted independent effects on training gains and asymptotic performance: older adults tended to show less improvement in scores than younger adults47, which is also consistent with our findings.",
              "There are three main limitations in this study: the first is that we did not have access to any information about the background of the participants: it is well-known that several factors influence cognitive function and the risk of dementia such as genetic risk factors48, as well as non-genetic risk factors including lifestyle-related factors49, for example education level, smoking history, history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, physical activity, body mass index, or concomitant pathologies such as stroke50, cardiovascular disease51, diabetes52, or chronic respiratory disease53.",
              "Gender is also postulated to influence some cognitive functions such as vocabulary capacity54.",
              "Due to the fact that we did not have access to this background information, we cannot establish whether the effects observed in the current study were influenced by any of these factors.",
              "Most probably, subjects playing with this kind of app are cognitively healthy and quite comfortable with mobile devices.",
              "The second limitation is the choice of the outcomes, namely, the scores of the CMG and the processing speed data obtained within the games.",
              "It could be argued that traditional clinical scales or scores would have been more effective in evaluating subjects\u2019 cognitive functioning;",
              "however, using the scores of the games to assess the course of the performance has been used in a previous study55.",
              "Furthermore, both of the scores of the CMG and processing speed have been shown to be good indicators of cognitive function16,19.",
              "In a recent study examining the effects of cognitive training on cognitive performance of healthy adults, the authors found that there was a transfer effect between the trained abilities and the instruments used only when the tests were similar to the trained situation (near effects).",
              "If the tests differed too much from the training tasks (far effects) no training effect was observed56.",
              "Therefore, using the scores of the games and the reaction times could be considered as a near-effect instrument/measure and quantification of the real transfer to daily activities is still needed.",
              "However, some studies did show a transfer to general cognitive function as tested byneuropsychological batteries for multiple cognitive domains11,16 and also demonstrated a protective effect in patients with MCI57.",
              "Those beneficial effects could be related to the multi-domains, novel and continuously challenging (self-adaptative) stimulation provided by most cognitive training apps, which has been shown to be superior to the routine mental activities of everyday life11.",
              "These challenging and unusual stimuli induce changes in brain activity and connectivity in areas that are known to be affected by aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",
              "Those changes may help counteract age- and disease-related alterations and help to explain cognitive benefits and transfers, once their link with cognitive improvements has been clearly established33,57.",
              "Finally, the study suffers a selection bias, since the participants were all users of this app and were therefore most probably familiar with the use of smartphones and current technology.",
              "This has two consequences: first, older people who are less familiar with mobile technology might find this app less usable and therefore the adherence may be lower.",
              "Secondly, a recent study underlined the importance of digital devices use in delaying cognitive decline in the older adults58, thus the participants of this study may have already been benefiting from this phenomenon and thus functioning at a higher cognitive level than those who do not regularly use mobile technology.",
              "Despite these limitations, the results of this study support that even at old age (above 80 years old), participants are able to use CMG and to train and improve cognition through CMG.",
              "Although technological devices and medical-related apps cannot single-handedly improve cognitive decline, in the absence of effective, low-cost, and accessible treatments for cognitive and motivational deficits, these brain training apps could be greatly beneficial to public health.",
              "One salient aspect of the games is that they could be combined with automated evaluation and assessment of cognitive function16,59.",
              "Therefore, we strongly suggest that the evaluation of cognitive function for long-term follow-up should not be restricted to cross-sectional measurement (typically done only once per year) but should also include longitudinal measurement to evaluate subjects\u2019 learning abilities or cognitive abilities in general if there is no training in between the assessments15.",
              "In this context, the presented method could be an interesting complementary tool due to its potential to become widely available thanks to the growing use of mobile technology.",
              "Another positive aspect is that the cognitive training and follow-up with games on mobile can be also proposed to patients with limited mobility, or living to far to come on a regular basis to specialized centers60, and in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic61,62.",
              "While cognitive training app games have been shown to improve memory in older people with mild cognitive impairment63, further studies are needed to determine if technologies, such as apps, can decrease dementia risk in healthy subjects or slow down the progression of the disease in patients suffering from cognitive impairment and if there is a transfer to the activities of daily living.",
              "We can, also, speculate that since psychomotor slowing associated with aging has an important negative effect on multi-tasking activities of daily living, improving the processing speed could have a positive effect on the quality of life of the participants64.",

              "This variety of programs allows professionals and end-users to choose the one that suits best with their interests and goals as not all people have the same needs, and not all programs are optimal for all people.",
              "However, web-based programs containing numerous exercises of different cognitive functions, without many accessories and applied to computers with large touch screens, might be the most appropriate cognitive programs for people with MCI and dementia.",
              "Besides, computer programs seem to be a promising strategy for enhancing the cognitive function of older people as they are more accessible (Maldonado, 2016) and cost-effective in comparison to traditional cognitive interventions (Gooding et al.",
