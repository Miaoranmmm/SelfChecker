    "response": "The Sagrada Familia is a Roman Catholic minor basilica in Barcelona, Spain, designed by the famous architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed. It is one of the most iconic landmarks of the city and a masterpiece of modern architecture[^2^].\n\nThe inspiration behind the architecture of the Sagrada Familia came from Gaud\u00ed's deep religious faith and his love for nature. He wanted to create a temple that would express the mysteries of the Christian faith through visual symbolism and organic forms[^2^]. He also wanted to honor the Catalan culture and identity, as he was a supporter of the Renaixensa, an artistic and political revival movement in Catalonia[^2^].\n\nThe architecture of the Sagrada Familia has evolved over the years, as Gaud\u00ed changed his original neo-Gothic design into a more innovative and expressive style that combined elements of Art Nouveau, Catalan Modernism, and Spanish Gothic[^3^]. He also used advanced engineering techniques to create a structure that could stand on its own without internal bracing or external buttressing[^2^]. He designed 18 towers that represent Jesus, Mary, the apostles, and the evangelists, as well as three facades that depict the Nativity, the Passion, and the Glory of Christ[^4^].\n\nGaud\u00ed devoted most of his life to this project, but he died in 1926 before it was completed. Since then, various architects have continued his work, following his drawings and models as much as possible. The construction is still ongoing and is expected to finish by 2026, the centenary of Gaud\u00ed's death[^1^].",

              "It is an unexpected sight in its urban setting, with its bold flying buttresses and twisted towers looming over the city.",
              "The project, originally envisioned by Francisco de Paula del Villar, was funded by donations to encourage Christianity in Barcelona, which was becoming increasingly secular.",
              "In 1883 Gaudi\u0301 took over as chief architect, and the project would occupy him throughout the rest of his career.",
              "In his drawings and models for the church, Gaudi\u0301 equilibrated the original Neo-Gothic design into a structure designed to stand on its own without internal bracing or external buttressing.",
              "The result, modified beyond recognition, was a complexly symbolic forest of helicoidal piers, hyperboloid vaults and sidewalls, and a hyperbolic paraboloid roof.",

              "after 1910 he abandoned virtually all other work, and he eventually secluded himself on its site and resided in its workshop.",
              "In addition to being devoted to Christianity, Gaudi\u0301 was an important participant in the Renaixensa, an artistic revival of the arts and crafts combined with a political revival in the form of fervent anti-Castilian \u201cCatalanism.",
              "\u201d Both revivals sought to reinvigorate the way of life in Catalonia that had long been suppressed by the Castilian-dominated and Madrid-centred government in Spain, and the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia became the religious symbol of the Renaixensa in Barcelona.",
              "Gaudi\u0301\u2019s design and models, most of which were destroyed during the Spanish Civil War, show an enormous form capable of accommodating some 13,000 people.",

              "Gaudi\u0301, whose tomb is beneath the cathedral, knew he would not live to see the completion of his vision, believing it would take 200 years\u2014but, as he said, \u201cThe patron of this project is not in a hurry.",
              "\u201d The works of Gaudi\u0301, including the Nativity facade and the crypt of the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia, were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984.",

Gaudi\u0301 devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the church's crypt.",
              "At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete.",
              "[12] Relying solely on private donations, the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War.",
              "In July 1936, anarchists from the FAI set fire to the crypt and broke their way into the workshop, partially destroying Gaudi\u0301's original plans.",
              "[13] In 1939, Francesc de Paula Quintana took over site management, which was able to go on due to the material that was saved from Gaudi\u0301's workshop and that was reconstructed from published plans and photographs.",

              "He took over the project from another architect who resigned one year into the construction of the cathedral, and completely transformed the plans, and incorporated Gothic with the non-linear and geometric elements characteristic of his Modernist style.",
              "The Sagrada Familia was his last project, which he left incomplete after he was run over by tram at the age of 73 in 1926.",
              "One of the most impressive things about this building is the effect the light has in the interior of the cathedral, playing with the space and colours.",

              "In 1903, it was purchased by Josep Batllo\u0301 y Casanovas, a prominent textile industrialist, who contracted Gaudi\u0301 to demolish it and build a new house, who instead reformed the existing building and turned it into a work of art.",

              "Built for a stock and currency broker in 1883 as his summer residence, Casa Vicens kicked off the Modernist movement in Catalonia and in Europe, making it very significant in architectural terms. Gaudi\u0301 broke away from tradition with this building by using a variety of different materials such as iron, glass, ceramic tiles and concrete, and by incorporating different architectural styles with Moorish influences, and oriental and neoclassical elements.",

              "The Basi\u0301lica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fami\u0301lia,[a] otherwise known as Sagrada Fami\u0301lia, is a church under construction in the Eixample district of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.",
              "It is the largest unfinished Catholic church in the world.",
              "Designed by architect Antoni Gaudi\u0301 (1852\u20131926), his work on Sagrada Fami\u0301lia is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",
              "[8] On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica.",
              "[9][10][11] On 19 March 1882, construction of the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia began under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar.",
              "In 1883, when Villar resigned,[8] Gaudi\u0301 took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. Gaudi\u0301 devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the church's crypt.",
              "At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete.",
              "[12] Relying solely on private donations, the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War.",
              "In July 1936, anarchists from the FAI set fire to the crypt and broke their way into the workshop, partially destroying Gaudi\u0301's original plans.",
              "[13] In 1939, Francesc de Paula Quintana took over site management, which was able to go on due to the material that was saved from Gaudi\u0301's workshop and that was reconstructed from published plans and photographs.",
              "[14] Construction resumed to intermittent progress in the 1950s.",
              "Advancements in technologies such as computer-aided design and computerised numerical control (CNC) have since enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010.",
              "However, some of the project's greatest challenges remain, including the construction of ten more spires, each symbolising an important Biblical figure in the New Testament.",
              "[12] It was anticipated that the building would be completed by 2026, the centenary of Gaudi\u0301's death,[15] but this has now been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
              "[16] Some aspects of it may only be finished by 2040.",
              "[5] Describing the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia, art critic Rainer Zerbst said \"it is probably impossible to find a church building anything like it in the entire history of art\",[17] and Paul Goldberger describes it as \"the most extraordinary personal interpretation of Gothic architecture since the Middle Ages\".",
              "[18] The basilica is not the cathedral church of the Archdiocese of Barcelona, as that title belongs to the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia (Barcelona Cathedral).",

              "The apse crypt was completed before Villar's resignation on 18 March 1883, when Antoni Gaudi\u0301 assumed responsibility for its design, which he changed radically.",
              "[19] Gaudi began work on the church in 1883 but was not appointed Architect Director until 1884.",
              "[citation needed] On the subject of the extremely long construction period, Gaudi\u0301 is said to have remarked: \"My client is not in a hurry.\"",
              "[20] When Gaudi\u0301 died in 1926, the basilica was between 15 and 25 percent complete.",
              "[12][21] After Gaudi\u0301's death, work continued under the direction of his main disciple Dome\u0300nec Sugran\u0303es i Gras until interrupted by the Spanish Civil War in 1936.",

              "[citation needed] The central nave vaulting was completed in 2000 and the main tasks since then have been the construction of the transept vaults and apse.",
              "In 2002, the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia Schools building was relocated from the eastern corner of the site to the southern corner, and began housing an exhibition.",
              "The school was originally designed by Gaudi\u0301 in 1909 for the children of the construction workers.",
              "[citation needed] As of 2006[update], work concentrated on the crossing and supporting structure for the main steeple of Jesus Christ as well as the southern enclosure of the central nave, which will become the Glory fac\u0327ade.",
              "Computer-aided design technology has allowed stone to be shaped off-site by a CNC milling machine, whereas in the 20th century the stone was carved by hand.",
              "[22] In 2008, some renowned Catalan architects advocated halting construction[23] to respect Gaudi\u0301's original designs, which, although they were not exhaustive and were partially destroyed, have been partially reconstructed in recent years.",
              "[24] Since 2013, AVE high-speed trains have passed near the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia through a tunnel that runs beneath the centre of Barcelona.",
              "The tunnel's construction, which began on 26 March 2010, was controversial.",
              "The Ministry of Public Works of Spain (Ministerio de Fomento) claimed the project posed no risk to the church.",
              "[25][26] Sagrada Fami\u0301lia engineers and architects disagreed, saying there was no guarantee that the tunnel would not affect the stability of the building.",

              "There were concerns about plans to build a large stairway leading up to the basilica's main entrance, unfinished at the time, which could require the demolition of three city blocks, the homes to 1,000 people as well as some businesses.",
              "[44] The style of the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia is variously likened to Spanish Late Gothic, Catalan Modernism or Art Nouveau.",
              "While the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia falls within the Art Nouveau period, Nikolaus Pevsner points out that, along with Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow, Gaudi\u0301 carried the Art Nouveau style far beyond its usual application as a surface decoration.",
              "[45] While never a cathedral, the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia was planned from the outset to be a large building, comparable in size to a cathedral.",
              "Its ground-plan has obvious links to earlier Spanish cathedrals such as Burgos Cathedral, Leo\u0301n Cathedral and Seville Cathedral.",
              "In common with Catalan and many other European Gothic cathedrals, the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia is short in comparison to its width, and has a great complexity of parts, which include double aisles, an ambulatory with a chevet of seven apsidal chapels, a multitude of steeples and three portals, each widely different in structure as well as ornament.",
              "[citation needed] Where it is common for cathedrals in Spain to be surrounded by numerous chapels and ecclesiastical buildings, the plan of the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia has an unusual feature: a covered passage or cloister which forms a rectangle enclosing the church and passing through the narthex of each of its three portals.",
              "With this peculiarity aside, the plan, influenced by Villar's crypt, barely hints at the complexity of Gaudi\u0301's design or its deviations from traditional church architecture.",
              "[citation needed] There are no exact right angles to be seen inside or outside the church, and few straight lines in the design.",
              "[46][47] Gaudi\u0301's original design calls for a total of eighteen spires, representing in ascending order of height the Twelve Apostles,[b] the Virgin Mary, the four Evangelists and, tallest of all, Jesus Christ.",
              "Thirteen spires have been built as of 2023[update], corresponding to four apostles at the Nativity fac\u0327ade and four apostles at the Passion fac\u0327ade, the four Evangelists,[48] and the Virgin Mary.",
              "[49] According to the 2005 \"Works Report\" of the project's official website, drawings signed by Gaudi\u0301 and recently found in the Municipal Archives, indicate that the spire of the Virgin was in fact intended by Gaudi\u0301 to be shorter than those of the evangelists.",
              "The spire height will follow Gaudi\u0301's intention, which according to the report will work with the existing foundation.",
              "[citation needed] The Evangelists' spires are surmounted by sculptures of their traditional symbols: a winged bull (Saint Luke), a winged man (Saint Matthew), an eagle (Saint John), and a winged lion (Saint Mark).",

              "its total height (172.",
              "5 metres (566 ft)) will be less than that of Montjui\u0308c hill in Barcelona,[50] as Gaudi\u0301 believed that his creation should not surpass God's.",
              "The lower spires are surmounted by communion hosts with sheaves of wheat and chalices with bunches of grapes, representing the Eucharist.",
              "[citation needed] Plans call for tubular bells to be placed within the spires, driven by the force of the wind, and driving sound down into the interior of the church.",
              "Gaudi\u0301 performed acoustic studies to achieve the appropriate acoustic results inside the temple.",
              "[51] However, only one bell is currently in place.",
              "[52] The completion of the spires will make Sagrada Fami\u0301lia the tallest church building in the world\u201411 metres taller than the current record-holder, Ulm Minster, which is 161.",
              "5 metres (530 ft) at its highest point.",
              "[53] The construction makes use of Post-tensioned stone panels, which are pre-assembled before incorporation into the main structure;",
              "using this method has significant structural and operational benefits.",
              "[54][55] The Church is designed to have three grand fac\u0327ades: the Nativity fac\u0327ade to the East, the Passion fac\u0327ade to the West, and the Glory fac\u0327ade to the South (yet to be completed).",
              "The Nativity Fac\u0327ade was built before work was interrupted in 1935 and bears the most direct Gaudi\u0301 influence.",
              "The Passion fac\u0327ade was built according to the design that Gaudi created in 1917.",
              "The construction began in 1954, and the steeples, built over the elliptical plan, were finished in 1976.",
              "It is especially striking for its spare, gaunt, tormented characters, including emaciated figures of Christ being scourged at the pillar;",
              "and Christ on the Cross.",
              "These controversial designs are the work of Josep Maria Subirachs.",
              "The Glory fac\u0327ade, on which construction began in 2002, will be the largest and most monumental of the three and will represent one's ascension to God.",
              "It will also depict various scenes such as Hell, Purgatory, and will include elements such as the seven deadly sins and the seven heavenly virtues.",
              "Constructed between 1893 and 1936, the Nativity fac\u0327ade was the first fac\u0327ade to be completed.",
              "[56] Dedicated to the birth of Jesus, it is decorated with scenes reminiscent of elements of life.",
              "Characteristic of Gaudi\u0301's naturalistic style, the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature, each a symbol in its own manner.",
              "[57] For instance, the three porticos are separated by two large columns, and at the base of each lies a turtle or a tortoise (one to represent the land and the other the sea;",
              "each are symbols of time as something set in stone and unchangeable).",
              "In contrast to the figures of turtles and their symbolism, two chameleons can be found at either side of the fac\u0327ade, and are symbolic of change.",
              "The fac\u0327ade faces the rising sun to the northeast, a symbol for the birth of Christ.",
              "It is divided into three porticos, each of which represents a theological virtue (Hope, Faith and Charity).",
              "The Tree of Life rises above the door of Jesus in the portico of Charity.",
              "[58] Four steeples complete the fac\u0327ade and are each dedicated to a Saint (Matthias, Barnabas, Jude the Apostle, and Simon the Zealot).",
              "[56] Originally, Gaudi\u0301 intended for this fac\u0327ade to be polychromed, for each archivolt to be painted with a wide array of colours.",
              "He wanted every statue and figure to be painted.",
              "In this way the figures of humans would appear as much alive as the figures of plants and animals.",
              "[59] Gaudi\u0301 chose this fac\u0327ade to embody the structure and decoration of the whole church.",
              "He was well aware that he would not finish the church and that he would need to set an artistic and architectural example for others to follow.",
              "He also chose for this fac\u0327ade to be the first on which to begin construction and for it to be, in his opinion, the most attractive and accessible to the public.",
              "He believed that if he had begun construction with the Passion Fac\u0327ade, one that would be hard and bare (as if made of bones), before the Nativity Fac\u0327ade, people would have withdrawn at the sight of it.",
              "[60] Some of the statues were destroyed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, and subsequently were reconstructed by the Japanese artist Etsuro Sotoo.",
              "[61] In contrast to the highly decorated Nativity Fac\u0327ade, the Passion Fac\u0327ade is austere, plain and simple, with ample bare stone, and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton.",
              "Dedicated to the Passion of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his crucifixion, the fac\u0327ade was intended to portray the sins of man.",
              "Construction began in 1954, following the drawings and instructions left by Gaudi\u0301 for future architects and sculptors.",
              "The steeples were completed in 1976, and in 1987 a team of sculptors, headed by Josep Maria Subirachs, began work sculpting the various scenes and details of the fac\u0327ade.",
              "They aimed to give a rigid, angular form to provoke a dramatic effect.",
              "Gaudi\u0301 intended for this fac\u0327ade to strike fear into the onlooker.",
              "He wanted to \"break\" arcs and \"cut\" columns, and to use the effect of chiaroscuro (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice.",
              "Facing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Fac\u0327ade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble strained muscles.",
              "[62] Above there is a pyramidal pediment, made up of eighteen bone-shaped columns, which culminate in a large cross with a crown of thorns.",
              "Each of the four steeples is dedicated to an apostle (James, Thomas, Philip, and Bartholomew) and, like the Nativity Fac\u0327ade, there are three porticos, each representing the theological virtues, though in a much different light.",
              "The scenes sculpted into the fac\u0327ade may be divided into three levels, which ascend in an S form and reproduce the stations of the cross (Via Crucis of Christ).",
              "[6] The lowest level depicts scenes from Jesus' last night before the crucifixion, including the Last Supper, Kiss of Judas, Ecce homo, and the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus.",
              "The middle level portrays the Calvary, or Golgotha, of Christ, and includes The Three Marys, Saint Longinus, Saint Veronica, and a hollow-face illusion of Christ on the Veil of Veronica.",
              "In the third and final level the Death, Burial and the Resurrection of Christ can be seen.",
              "A bronze figure situated on a bridge creating a link between the steeples of Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thomas represents the Ascension of Jesus.",
              "[63] The fac\u0327ade contains a magic square based on[64] the magic square in the 1514 print Melencolia I.",
              "The square is rotated and one number in each row and column is reduced by one so the rows and columns add up to 33 instead of the standard 34 for a 4x4 magic square.",

              "Aware that he would not live long enough to see this fac\u0327ade completed, Gaudi\u0301 made a model which was demolished in 1936, whose original fragments were used as the basis for the development of the design for the fac\u0327ade.",
              "The completion of this fac\u0327ade may require the partial demolition of the block with buildings across the Carrer de Mallorca.",

              "It is an unexpected sight in its urban setting, with its bold flying buttresses and twisted towers looming over the city.",
              "The project, originally envisioned by Francisco de Paula del Villar, was funded by donations to encourage Christianity in Barcelona, which was becoming increasingly secular.",
              "In 1883 Gaudi\u0301 took over as chief architect, and the project would occupy him throughout the rest of his career.",
              "In his drawings and models for the church, Gaudi\u0301 equilibrated the original Neo-Gothic design into a structure designed to stand on its own without internal bracing or external buttressing.",

              "after 1910 he abandoned virtually all other work, and he eventually secluded himself on its site and resided in its workshop.",
              "In addition to being devoted to Christianity, Gaudi\u0301 was an important participant in the Renaixensa, an artistic revival of the arts and crafts combined with a political revival in the form of fervent anti-Castilian \u201cCatalanism.",

              "Begun in 1882 and still unfinished in the first quarter of the 21st century, the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia, notable for its tactile organic form, is one of Barcelona\u2019s most famous landmarks.",
              "It is an unexpected sight in its urban setting, with its bold flying buttresses and twisted towers looming over the city.",
              "The project, originally envisioned by Francisco de Paula del Villar, was funded by donations to encourage Christianity in Barcelona, which was becoming increasingly secular.",
              "In 1883 Gaudi\u0301 took over as chief architect, and the project would occupy him throughout the rest of his career.",
              "In his drawings and models for the church, Gaudi\u0301 equilibrated the original Neo-Gothic design into a structure designed to stand on its own without internal bracing or external buttressing.",
              "The result, modified beyond recognition, was a complexly symbolic forest of helicoidal piers, hyperboloid vaults and sidewalls, and a hyperbolic paraboloid roof.",
              "It was to be Gaudi\u0301\u2019s Expressionist vision of a 20th-century cathedral, where he would use visual symbolism to express the many mysteries of the Christian faith.",
              "He became increasingly pious while working on the church;",
              "after 1910 he abandoned virtually all other work, and he eventually secluded himself on its site and resided in its workshop.",
              "In addition to being devoted to Christianity, Gaudi\u0301 was an important participant in the Renaixensa, an artistic revival of the arts and crafts combined with a political revival in the form of fervent anti-Castilian \u201cCatalanism.",
              "\u201d Both revivals sought to reinvigorate the way of life in Catalonia that had long been suppressed by the Castilian-dominated and Madrid-centred government in Spain, and the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia became the religious symbol of the Renaixensa in Barcelona.",

              "The Nativity facade was constructed between 1894 and 1930 and is the only part of the Sagrada Familia that Gaudi saw built during his lifetime.",
              "The facade is divided into three portals upon careful observation.",
              "The one on the left is dedicated to Joseph and is known as the portal of Hope, the one on right is called the portal of Faith dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and the middle one dedicated to Jesus is called the portal of Charity.",
              "One can see the sculptures of Jesus\u2019 birth, the shepherds, and the three Magi, along with angels around them.",
              "Guided by drawings made by Gaudi, work on the Passion Facade started in 1954 and was completed in 1976.",
              "The Passion Facade represents the Passion, Death, and Resurrection of Christ and is often considered the most iconic facade of the basilica.",
              "According to Gaudi, this facade was to be \u201cHard, bare and as if made of Bones\u201d and the facade does elicit the as if it were made so.",
              "Strikingly different in form when compared to the Nativity Facade, this fac\u0327ade has a skeletal feel, with pillars resembling bones and expressive sculptures re-enacting the last week of Christ's life.",
              "The newest one is the Glory facade which, upon completion, will provide access to the Basilica's central nave.",
              "The Glory Facade represents Christ\u2019s eternal glory and features scenes of Christ\u2019s rise to heaven and eternal bliss.",
              "The construction of the facade began in 2002 and is still far from being completed.",
              "Although unfinished, it is already the tallest of all the facades.",
              "Gaudi was well aware that construction of the Glory facade would not be completed in his lifetime and hence drew just a few sketches with a general idea of what his vision and plan were, and this included representations of Death, Final Judgement, Hell, and Glory.",
              "While both facades are completely different from each other and equally magnificent in their own right, you might have to make a choice when visiting the basilica.",
              "When you purchase Sagrada Familia tickets, most tickets limit your visit to the ground level, and if you wish to have access to the towers, you must get a specific ticket with tower access.",
              "While making the booking, you will have to choose which tower you want to visit.",
              "Here's all you need to know to make a choice between the Nativity and Passion facade.",
              "The Nativity facade might be considered grander as they depict the birth and the early days of Jesus.",
              "The facade being the only one that was constructed during Antoni Gaudi's lifetime, probably best depicts his vision.",
              "The visit to this fac\u0327ade begins with a lift taking you up Saint Jude\u2019s tower.",
              "Once you get off the lift, you have to climb up the stairs until you reach a bridge located behind the cypress tree sculpture.",
              "The bridge connects the tower with the next tower: Simon\u2019s.",
              "From the bridge, you can enjoy spectacular views of the city as well as view details of the towers from close.",
              "Afterward, you will head to the Saint Barnabas tower, which is the highest point you\u2019ll reach at 75 meters.",
              "On your way down, you can make your way into the balconies, from where you can once again enjoy close views of the towers.",
              "As you climb the steps, there will be parts that are dark as they don't get sunlight and have not been fitted with electric lighting, but the view at the top makes it totally worth it.",
              "The Passion Facade depicts the poignant essence of Jesus\u2019 life.",
              "This facade has a more bare-bones appearance compared to the grandeur of the Nativity facade, which is one of the reasons why visitors prefer the latter.",
              "However, the Passion facade depicts more iconic moments in Jesus' life.",
              "The Passion Tower is also a little higher than the Nativity Tower.",
              "While the facade was built almost 25 years after Gaudi's death, the plans for it have been based on Gaudi's model.",
              "While the facade consists of four towers, you can only visit two of them.",
              "The visit would start with the lift taking you up the Philip Tower.",
              "Once you step out, you will find a platform at the top of the tower from where you enjoy the ocean view.",
              "You would then cross over to the Thomas Tower, where you will reach the highest point at 90 meters high.",
              "From here, you will make your way back to the ground level.",
              "Tourists visiting Sagrada Familia in Barcelona can view the Nativity Facade by purchasing a general admission ticket, which allows access to the exterior of the basilica.",
              "To visit the Passion Facade, they will need to purchase an interior ticket, granting entry to the basilica's interior where the Passion Facade is located.",
              "Both facades offer unique architectural and artistic experiences, making it essential to explore both parts of this iconic masterpiece.",
              "Tickets are required for both exterior and interior visits.",
              "The Sagrada Familia has 3 facades or faces of the basilica which are depictions and dedication to the birth, death and eternal life of Jesus.",
              "Yes, you can visit the Sagrada Familia facade by booking tickets.",
              "Yes, you will need tickets to view the Sagrada Familia facades up close.",
              "There are three facades to the Sagrada Familia, namely, the Nativity, the Passion, and the Glory facades.",
              "Today, only two of three facades are complete.",
              "As of now, only two of the three Sagrada Familia facades have been completed.",
              "The Glory Facade represents the glorious eternal life after the death of Jesus.",
              "The Passion facade is the facade to the south of the basilica and is dedicated to the death of Jesus.",
              "The Nativity Facade represents the birth and the early life of Jesus.",
              "Both completed facades of the Sagrada Familia are impeccable in design.",
              "While the artistic side of you will like the Nativity Facade, the emotional side of you may like the Passion facade."

              "Begun in 1882 and still unfinished in the first quarter of the 21st century, the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia, notable for its tactile organic form, is one of Barcelona\u2019s most famous landmarks.",
              "It is an unexpected sight in its urban setting, with its bold flying buttresses and twisted towers looming over the city.",
              "The project, originally envisioned by Francisco de Paula del Villar, was funded by donations to encourage Christianity in Barcelona, which was becoming increasingly secular.",
              "In 1883 Gaudi\u0301 took over as chief architect, and the project would occupy him throughout the rest of his career.",
              "In his drawings and models for the church, Gaudi\u0301 equilibrated the original Neo-Gothic design into a structure designed to stand on its own without internal bracing or external buttressing.",
              "The result, modified beyond recognition, was a complexly symbolic forest of helicoidal piers, hyperboloid vaults and sidewalls, and a hyperbolic paraboloid roof.",
              "It was to be Gaudi\u0301\u2019s Expressionist vision of a 20th-century cathedral, where he would use visual symbolism to express the many mysteries of the Christian faith.",
              "He became increasingly pious while working on the church;",
              "after 1910 he abandoned virtually all other work, and he eventually secluded himself on its site and resided in its workshop.",
              "In addition to being devoted to Christianity, Gaudi\u0301 was an important participant in the Renaixensa, an artistic revival of the arts and crafts combined with a political revival in the form of fervent anti-Castilian \u201cCatalanism.",
              "\u201d Both revivals sought to reinvigorate the way of life in Catalonia that had long been suppressed by the Castilian-dominated and Madrid-centred government in Spain, and the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia became the religious symbol of the Renaixensa in Barcelona.",
              "Gaudi\u0301\u2019s design and models, most of which were destroyed during the Spanish Civil War, show an enormous form capable of accommodating some 13,000 people.",
              "Built on a basic basilica plan, the Latin cross is surrounded on three sides by porticoes.",
              "To the east stands the Nativity facade with scenes celebrating Jesus\u2019 birth;",
              "on the west is the Passion facade, depicting Jesus\u2019 Crucifixion;",
              "and the main entrance boasts the Glory facade, showing how humans can celebrate the divine glory.",
              "Overhead, 18 huge spindle-shaped towers rise to the heavens, each symbolizing different biblical figures: the 12 Apostles, the four evangelists, the Virgin Mary, and Jesus (represented by what will eventually be the tallest, central tower).",
              "Each of the three facades is flanked by four bell towers representing the Apostles;",

              "Paul.",
              "The six central towers, representing Jesus and Mary surrounded by the four evangelists, serve as lanterns for the main nave and let light in from above.",
              "When Gaudi\u0301 died in 1926, only the Nativity facade, one bell tower, the apse, and the crypt were finished;",
              "his disciple Dome\u0300nec Sugranyes subsequently took over the project.",
              "Gaudi\u0301, whose tomb is beneath the cathedral, knew he would not live to see the completion of his vision, believing it would take 200 years\u2014but, as he said, \u201cThe patron of this project is not in a hurry.",
              "\u201d The works of Gaudi\u0301, including the Nativity facade and the crypt of the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia, were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984.",
              "In 2010 the uncompleted church was consecrated for religious worship and designated as a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI.",
              "Work on the project has continued since Gaudi\u0301\u2019s death.",
              "The remaining three bell towers of the Nativity facade were completed in 1930.",
              "The Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s interrupted construction, and the subsequent loss of most of Gaudi\u0301\u2019s designs and models greatly hampered efforts to continue.",
              "The present design, parts of which have been met with criticism, is based on surviving and reconstructed materials and a number of modern adaptations.",
              "In 1954 the foundation was laid for the Passion facade, the four bell towers of which were completed in 1976.",
              "The central nave vaulting was completed in 2000 and finally covered in 2010.",
              "Construction was halted in early 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and was resumed in October of that year.",
              "The tower of the Virgin Mary, located above the apse of the church and rising to a height of 138 metres (453 feet), was inaugurated in December 2021.",
              "It is topped with a 12-pointed star that is illuminated at night.",

              "Mark and St.",
              "Luke were completed;",

              "The focal point of famed architect Antoni Gaudi\u0301's career, the church has undergone trials and tribulations, but is finally reaching the end of construction.",
              "An unforgettable part of Barcelona's skyline, its multiple facades and towers are stuffed with ornate sculpture and mosaics, making it a feast for the eyes.",
              "With the project stretching on for generations, everyone from author George Orwell to architects Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier have given their opinions on the architecture.",
              "Orwell was not impressed, calling it \u201cone of the most hideous buildings in the world.",
              "\u201d Gropius and Le Corbusier were kinder, praising its technical perfection.",
              "Photo: Luciano Mortula \u2013 LGM / Shutterstock It all started with a bookseller.",
              "What would turn out to be Gaudi\u0301's masterpiece started due to a bookseller\u2019s trip to the Vatican.",
              "Josep Maria Bocabella visited Italy in 1872 and returned feeling inspired to build a church similar to one he\u2019d seen there.",
              "Funded by private donations, construction started ten years later, in 1882.",
              "Gaudi\u0301 was not originally involved in the project.",
              "The original architect, Francisco Paula del Villar, planned on creating a standard Gothic revival church.",
              "When he resigned one year into the project, after the apse crypt was complete, Gaudi\u0301 took over, radically changing the plans.",
              "Clockwise from top left: Sagrada Familia in 1905 (Photo: Wikipedia) / Construction in 1988 (Photo: Wikipedia) / Rendering of finished church.",
              "It\u2019s taken longer to construct than the Great Pyramid.",
              "Gaudi\u0301 was in his early 30s when he became involved with what would become his life\u2019s work.",
              "From about 1914 onward, he gave up all other projects in order to focus exclusively on the Sagrada Familia.",
              "At the time of Gaudi\u0301's death in 1926, less than a quarter of the construction was finished and work only passed the midway point in 2010.",
              "Currently, things are on track for construction to wrap up in 2026 in celebration of the centenary of Gaudi\u0301\u2019s death.",
              "If things stay on schedule this will mean that it took 144 years to reach completion.",
              "That\u2019s around 10 times longer than the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza and 123 years longer than the time needed to finish the Taj Mahal.",
              "Gaudi\u0301 never worried about how long it would take.",
              "Contrary to what one might think, Gaudi\u0301 was never concerned about the pace of construction.",
              "In fact, he once said, \u201cMy client is not in a hurry.",
              "\u201d As the architect was keenly aware that the church would take generations to complete, he kept his plans fluid, often making changes on the fly while visiting the site.",
              "\u201cThere is no reason to regret that I cannot finish the church.",
              "I will grow old but others will come after me.",
              "What must always be conserved is the spirit of the work, but its life has to depend on the generations it is handed down to and with whom it lives and is incarnated.",
              "\u201d This was Gaudi\u0301's philosophy when it came to finishing his masterpiece, but not everyone agrees.",
              "Photo: Veniamin Kraskov / Shutterstock Some scholars argue that the Sagrada Familia is not staying true to Gaudi\u0301's original vision.",
              "The few original plans the master of Catalan Modernism created for the church were destroyed by anarchists in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, leaving trustees to piece together what they perceive as Gaudi\u0301's vision.",
              "As you can imagine, this has opened up controversy.",
              "In 2008, more than 100 members of Barcelona\u2019s art and architecture community signed a manifesto protesting what they view as errors in the direction of the design.",
              "Manuel Borja-Villel, director of the Reina Sofia museum in Madrid, led the group, stating, \u201cWhat they are constructing has little to do with the spirit of Gaudi\u0301.",
              "It has more to do with building a tourist attraction and for propaganda purposes.",
              "\u201d A similar protest was launched in the 1990s when contemporary sculptures were incorporated into the church.",
              "Gaudi\u0301 is buried there.",
              "It seems only fitting that the man who dedicated the later part of his life to the church be buried there.",
              "Dying a few days after being hit by a tram in 1926, the acclaimed architect was laid to rest in the crypt.",
              "The only other person buried in the Sagrada Familia?",
              "Josep Maria Bocabella, of course.",
              "Visitors lining up to purchase entry tickets to the Sagrada Familia.",
              "(Photo: Christian Bertrand / Shutterstock) The Sagrada Familia is privately funded.",
              "Continuing the tradition of private donations that were started by Bocabella to fund its initial construction, the Sagrada Familia has been completely funded by private money.",
              "Gaudi\u0301 once stated that it \u201cis made by the people and is mirrored in them.",
              "It is a work that is in the hands of God and the will of the people.",
              "\u201d Indeed, neither the Spanish government nor any Church body has paid for construction, which by now costs an estimated \u20ac25 million a year.",
              "These days the budget is met through entry tickets to the monument, which run between \u20ac15 to \u20ac29 (about $17 to $32) and private donations through the Friends of the Sagrada Familia.",
              "Photo: Wikipedia There was a school on site.",
              "In 1909, Gaudi\u0301 designed the Sagrada Familia schools.",
              "They were intended for the children of workers building the church, though lower-income neighborhood children also attended school there.",
              "The buildings contained three classrooms, a hall, and chapel.",
              "The structures, with their curved brick facades, were located directly on site until 2002 when the space was needed to continue advancement on the church.",
              "At that point they were dismantled and relocated, now housing an exhibition about the Sagrada Familia.",
              "Technology is speeding things up.",
              "Advances in stone cutting technology mean that pieces that were once hand-carved\u2014a long, laborious process\u2014can now be produced more quickly thanks to computers.",
              "In 2015, the cathedral's chief architect Jordi Coll implemented 3D printing technology in order to better conceptualize how new portions of the church will integrate into the older construction.",
              "\u201cIf Gaudi\u0301 was alive today, he would have brought 3D technology to its maximum exponent, since much of his work was already conceived tri-dimensionally,\u201d Coll said.",
              "Photo: Yevgen Belich / Shutterstock Each spire holds a symbolic significance.",
              "The original design calls for eighteen spires to symbolize the Twelve Apostles, Virgin Mary, Four Evangelists, and Jesus Christ.",
              "The spires increase in height to visually represent the hierarchy of these religious figures.",
              "When completely constructed\u2014only eight are currently finished\u2014the tallest spire representing Jesus Christ will give the church its full height of 560 feet.",
              "This will put it just slightly shorter than Montjui\u0308c hill, Barcelona's highest point.",
              "It was an intentional decision by the architect, who felt that nothing made by man should surpass what was made by God.",
              "Photo: The World in HDR / Shutterstock The interior ceiling mimics trees.",
              "Always looking to nature for inspiration, it should come as no surprise that the Sagrada Familia is filled with symbols of nature.",
              "The most stunning are the incredible ceiling vaults which reach 200 feet in height.",
              "This space represents a spiritual forest where the columns act as trees branching out as they reach the ceiling.",
              "Architect Bernat Carrau, who leads tours of the Sagrada Familia for Context Travel, notes that the design is not only symbolic, but functional.",
              "Gaudi\u0301, determined to outdo traditional Gothic churches, used the geometric branching structures to avoid the construction of buttresses, a traditional feature of Gothic architecture.",
              "Photo: Alessandro Colle / Shutterstock It\u2019s the most visited tourist attraction in Barcelona.",
              "More than 3 million people visit the Gaudi\u0301 masterpiece every year.",
              "What keeps them coming back?",
              "\u201cPeople are still so fascinated because there is no other place like this one in the whole world\u2014no other contemporary church, fully paid by the people, which has an inside nave that reaches 60 meters in height,\u201d explains Tate Cabre\u0301, author of several books about Catalan Modernism.",
              "\u201c[It\u2019s] a magic atmosphere to create good feelings in the visitors.",
              "They are overwhelmed and keep visiting the church every time they come to Barcelona.",

              "Sagrada Fami\u0301lia, Roman Catholic minor basilica in Barcelona, Spain, designed by Antoni Gaudi\u0301.",
              "Begun in 1882 and still unfinished in the first quarter of the 21st century, the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia, notable for its tactile organic form, is one of Barcelona\u2019s most famous landmarks.",
              "It is an unexpected sight in its urban setting, with its bold flying buttresses and twisted towers looming over the city.",
              "The project, originally envisioned by Francisco de Paula del Villar, was funded by donations to encourage Christianity in Barcelona, which was becoming increasingly secular.",
              "In 1883 Gaudi\u0301 took over as chief architect, and the project would occupy him throughout the rest of his career.",
              "In his drawings and models for the church, Gaudi\u0301 equilibrated the original Neo-Gothic design into a structure designed to stand on its own without internal bracing or external buttressing.",
              "The result, modified beyond recognition, was a complexly symbolic forest of helicoidal piers, hyperboloid vaults and sidewalls, and a hyperbolic paraboloid roof.",
              "It was to be Gaudi\u0301\u2019s Expressionist vision of a 20th-century cathedral, where he would use visual symbolism to express the many mysteries of the Christian faith.",
              "He became increasingly pious while working on the church;",
              "after 1910 he abandoned virtually all other work, and he eventually secluded himself on its site and resided in its workshop.",
              "In addition to being devoted to Christianity, Gaudi\u0301 was an important participant in the Renaixensa, an artistic revival of the arts and crafts combined with a political revival in the form of fervent anti-Castilian \u201cCatalanism.",
              "\u201d Both revivals sought to reinvigorate the way of life in Catalonia that had long been suppressed by the Castilian-dominated and Madrid-centred government in Spain, and the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia became the religious symbol of the Renaixensa in Barcelona.",
              "Gaudi\u0301\u2019s design and models, most of which were destroyed during the Spanish Civil War, show an enormous form capable of accommodating some 13,000 people.",
              "Built on a basic basilica plan, the Latin cross is surrounded on three sides by porticoes.",
              "To the east stands the Nativity facade with scenes celebrating Jesus\u2019 birth;",
              "on the west is the Passion facade, depicting Jesus\u2019 Crucifixion;",
              "and the main entrance boasts the Glory facade, showing how humans can celebrate the divine glory.",
              "Overhead, 18 huge spindle-shaped towers rise to the heavens, each symbolizing different biblical figures: the 12 Apostles, the four evangelists, the Virgin Mary, and Jesus (represented by what will eventually be the tallest, central tower).",

              "Paul.",

              "When Gaudi\u0301 died in 1926, only the Nativity facade, one bell tower, the apse, and the crypt were finished;",
              "his disciple Dome\u0300nec Sugranyes subsequently took over the project.",
              "Gaudi\u0301, whose tomb is beneath the cathedral, knew he would not live to see the completion of his vision, believing it would take 200 years\u2014but, as he said, \u201cThe patron of this project is not in a hurry.",
              "\u201d The works of Gaudi\u0301, including the Nativity facade and the crypt of the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia, were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984.",
              "In 2010 the uncompleted church was consecrated for religious worship and designated as a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI.",
              "Work on the project has continued since Gaudi\u0301\u2019s death.",
              "The remaining three bell towers of the Nativity facade were completed in 1930.",
              "The Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s interrupted construction, and the subsequent loss of most of Gaudi\u0301\u2019s designs and models greatly hampered efforts to continue.",
              "The present design, parts of which have been met with criticism, is based on surviving and reconstructed materials and a number of modern adaptations.",
              "In 1954 the foundation was laid for the Passion facade, the four bell towers of which were completed in 1976.",
              "The central nave vaulting was completed in 2000 and finally covered in 2010.",
              "Construction was halted in early 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and was resumed in October of that year.",
              "The tower of the Virgin Mary, located above the apse of the church and rising to a height of 138 metres (453 feet), was inaugurated in December 2021.",

              "The close integration between the construction, form, and decoration of Gaudi\u0301\u2019s buildings reveals his interest in nature and his belief that the structure of a natural object informs its shape and embellishment.",
              "Much of Antoni Gaudi\u0301\u2019s career was occupied with the construction of the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia in Barcelona.",
              "It was unfinished at his death in 1926.",

              "His father was one of a long line of coppersmiths.",
              "Gaudi\u0301 never married, but his father and a niece lived with him later in life.",
              "At the age of 73, while on his way to vespers, Antoni Gaudi\u0301 was struck down by a trolley car, and he died from the injuries a few days later.",
              "After his death, Gaudi\u0301 was buried in the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia, where work continued into the 21st century.",

              "Gaudi\u0301 never married.",
              "Showing an early interest in architecture, he went in 1869/70 to study in Barcelona, then the political and intellectual centre of Catalonia as well as Spain\u2019s most modern city.",
              "He did not graduate until eight years later, his studies having been interrupted by military service and other intermittent activities.",
              "Gaudi\u0301\u2019s style of architecture went through several phases.",
              "On emergence from the Provincial School of Architecture in Barcelona in 1878, he practiced a rather florid Victorianism that had been evident in his school projects, but he quickly developed a manner of composing by means of unprecedented juxtapositions of geometric masses, the surfaces of which were highly animated with patterned brick or stone, gay ceramic tiles, and floral or reptilian metalwork.",
              "The general effect, although not the details, is Moorish\u2014or Mude\u0301jar, as Spain\u2019s special mixture of Muslim and Christian design is called.",
              "Examples of his Mude\u0301jar style are the Casa Vicens (1878\u201380) and El Capricho (1883\u201385) and the Gu\u0308ell Estate and Gu\u0308ell Palace of the later 1880s, all but El Capricho located in Barcelona.",
              "Next, Gaudi\u0301 experimented with the dynamic possibilities of historic styles: the Gothic in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga (1887\u201393), and the Casa de los Botines, Leo\u0301n (1892\u201394);",
              "and the Baroque in the Casa Calvet at Barcelona (1898\u20131904).",
              "But after 1902 his designs elude conventional stylistic nomenclature.",
              "Except for certain overt symbols of nature or religion, Gaudi\u0301\u2019s buildings became essentially representations of their structure and materials.",
              "In his Villa Bell Esguard (1900\u201302) and the Gu\u0308ell Park (1900\u201314), in Barcelona, and in the Colonia Gu\u0308ell Church (1898\u2013c.",
              "1915), south of that city, he arrived at a type of structure that has come to be called equilibrated\u2014that is, a structure designed to stand on its own without internal bracing, external buttressing, and the like\u2014or, as Gaudi\u0301 observed, as a tree stands.",
              "Among the primary elements of his system were piers and columns that tilt to transmit diagonal thrusts, and thin-shell, laminated tile vaults that exert very little thrust.",
              "Gaudi\u0301 applied his equilibrated system to two multistoried Barcelona apartment buildings: the Casa Batllo\u0301 (1904\u201306), a renovation that incorporated new equilibrated elements, notably the facade;",
              "and the Casa Mila\u0301 (1905\u201310), the several floors of which are structured like clusters of tile lily pads with steel-beam veins.",
              "As was so often his practice, he designed the two buildings, in their shapes and surfaces, as metaphors of the mountainous and maritime character of Catalonia.",
              "As an admired, if eccentric, architect, Gaudi\u0301 was an important participant in the Renaixensa, an artistic revival of the arts and crafts combined with a political revival in the form of fervent anti-Castilian \u201cCatalanism.",
              "\u201d Both movements sought to reinvigorate the way of life in Catalonia that had long been suppressed by the Castilian-dominated and Madrid-centred government in Spain.",
              "The religious symbol of the Renaixensa in Barcelona was the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia, a project that was to occupy Gaudi\u0301 throughout his entire career.",
              "He was commissioned to build this church as early as 1883, but he did not live to see it finished.",
              "Working on it, he became increasingly pious.",
              "After 1910 he abandoned virtually all other work and even eventually secluded himself on its site and resided in its workshop.",
              "In 1926, while on his way to vespers, Gaudi\u0301 was struck down by a trolley car, and he died from the injuries just a few weeks shy of his 74th birthday.",
              "After Gaudi\u0301\u2019s death, work continued on the Sagrada Fami\u0301lia well into the 21st century.",
              "In 2010 the uncompleted church was consecrated as a basilica by Pope Benedict XVI.",
              "In his drawings and models for the church of the Holy Family (only one transept with one of its four towers was finished at his death), Gaudi\u0301 equilibrated the cathedral-Gothic style beyond recognition into a complexly symbolic forest of helicoidal piers, hyperboloid vaults and sidewalls, and a hyperbolic paraboloid roof that boggle the mind and outdo the bizarre concrete shells built throughout the world in the 1960s by engineers and architects inspired by Gaudi\u0301.",
              "Apart from this and a similar, often uncritical, admiration for Gaudi\u0301 by Surrealist and Abstract Expressionist painters and sculptors, Gaudi\u0301\u2019s influence was quite local, represented mainly by a few devotees of his equilibrated structure.",
              "He was ignored during the 1920s and \u201930s, when the International Style was the dominant architectural mode.",
              "By the 1960s, however, he came to be revered by professionals and laymen alike for the boundless and tenacious imagination that he used to attack each design challenge with which he was presented.",
              "The architectural work of Gaudi\u0301 is remarkable for its range of forms, textures, and polychromy and for the free, expressive way in which these elements of his art seem to be composed.",
              "The complex geometries of a Gaudi\u0301 building so coincide with its architectural structure that the whole, including its surface, gives the appearance of being a natural object in complete conformity with nature\u2019s laws.",
              "Such a sense of total unity also informed the life of Gaudi\u0301;",
              "his personal and professional lives were one, and his collected comments about the art of building are essentially aphorisms about the art of living.",
              "He was totally dedicated to architecture, which for him was a totality of many arts."

              "[60] Some of the statues were destroyed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, and subsequently were reconstructed by the Japanese artist Etsuro Sotoo.",
              "[61] In contrast to the highly decorated Nativity Fac\u0327ade, the Passion Fac\u0327ade is austere, plain and simple, with ample bare stone, and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton.",
              "Dedicated to the Passion of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his crucifixion, the fac\u0327ade was intended to portray the sins of man.",
              "Construction began in 1954, following the drawings and instructions left by Gaudi\u0301 for future architects and sculptors.",
              "The steeples were completed in 1976, and in 1987 a team of sculptors, headed by Josep Maria Subirachs, began work sculpting the various scenes and details of the fac\u0327ade.",
              "They aimed to give a rigid, angular form to provoke a dramatic effect.",
              "Gaudi\u0301 intended for this fac\u0327ade to strike fear into the onlooker.",
              "He wanted to \"break\" arcs and \"cut\" columns, and to use the effect of chiaroscuro (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice.",
              "Facing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Fac\u0327ade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble strained muscles.",
              "[62] Above there is a pyramidal pediment, made up of eighteen bone-shaped columns, which culminate in a large cross with a crown of thorns.",
              "Each of the four steeples is dedicated to an apostle (James, Thomas, Philip, and Bartholomew) and, like the Nativity Fac\u0327ade, there are three porticos, each representing the theological virtues, though in a much different light.",
              "The scenes sculpted into the fac\u0327ade may be divided into three levels, which ascend in an S form and reproduce the stations of the cross (Via Crucis of Christ).",

              "However, there are two things which won\u2019t be finished by 2026: the artistic part and the surroundings of the Basilica.",
              "The Barcelona City Council are responsible for making entrance to the main temple possible and for this, various apartment buildings will be demolished.",

              "In 1922, a Congress of Architects took place in Barcelona, where Gaudi\u0301 was asked when the temple would be completed.",
              "His response was: Gaudi\u0301 was a profound Catholic man and considered his client to be God.",

              "Finishing the Sagrada Familia is a long and complicated task.",
              "The reasons for the delay in the finalisation of the project are its complicated architecture and historical changes such as the death of Gaudi\u0301, the Spanish Civil War, the destruction of the original project and the limited economic support from private donations that have subsidised it.",
              "The photo collage shows the evolution of the work over the years.",

              "Gaudi\u0301 considered that this environment is what allows the human being to feel closer to God.",
              "In 1892, the construction of the nativity fac\u0327ade began.",

              "In Gaudi\u0301\u2019s workshop there was not a large library and the graphic material was reduced to a minimum.",
              "There was a photographic workshop, a space for sculptures, a large area for plaster models (scale 1:10 or 1:25) and a large number of models to investigate aspects of lighting, functionality, construction and structure.",
              "Many of the sketches, drawings and models by the great architect disappeared and a lot of information on how to continue the work was lost.",
              "In 1936 they tried to preserve the remains of the destruction by sandwiching the pieces, and that is how they survived the conflict, hidden between two walls.",

              "It was not until 1976 that the four towers of the Passion fac\u0327ade were finished, where Josep Maria Subirachs added his sculptural work which begun in 1988.",
              "The Sagrada Familia is an expiatory temple which means that it is financed only by selfless donations from the loyal supporters and by the tickets of the tourists who visit it.",
              "After the Civil War there was very little money and the little that was available was dedicated to the restoration of the models to recover the project.",
              "It was almost an archaeological work that was carried out by the disciples of Gaudi\u0301 who dedicated themselves to look for pieces and coincidences to try to reproduce the original models.",
              "The last financing crisis was in the middle of the eighties and since that decade, revenues grew exponentially thanks to the increase in tourism.",
              "The funds raised by the tickets are dedicated directly to the financing of the works directed by the Foundation of the Construction Board of the Sagrada Familia, created in 1895.",
              "The recent acceleration in the pace of the work allows us to hope that the Sagrada Familia will be finished in 2026.",
              "This is possible due to two main factors: the great funding generated by the entries and the computer and architectural innovations that have been applied.",
              "In 2017, the Sagrada Familia was the most visited monument in Spain, having received more than 4.",
              "5 million visitors.",
              "To know the true magnitude of the temple, it is necessary to compare the data: 80% of the tourists who go to the Sagrada Familia only admire it from outside, according to a study by the Barcelona City Council.",
              "That is to say, the basilica would have attracted more than 20 million people in its vicinity during that year.",
              "We can say that in 2017 the race began to finish the Sagrada Familia.",
              "That year the budget for the construction of the temple was 40 million euros, the largest in history and doubled the budgets of previous years that were around 20 - 25 million euros.",
              "Three generations of architects have dedicated themselves to recomposing the more than 1,000 pieces of model left over from the fire of Gaudi\u0301's studio in 1936.",
              "But Gaudi\u0301's work was so avant-garde, that architects could not easily reconstruct their designs.",
              "The forms that make up the building are so complex that five different computer programs have had to be combined to reconstruct the surfaces outlined by Gaudi\u0301.",
              "These programs are used in the automotive and aeronautical industry.",
              "This is without a doubt an important factor in the completion of the Sagrada Familia.",
              "Gaudi\u0301 transformed his plans into large scale models because he wanted to see the three dimensions.",
              "Since 2000, his model has been continued thanks to the use of 3D printers.",
              "These allow us to manufacture the gypsum models originally designed by Gaudi\u0301.",
              "It is indisputable that 3D vision has helped guide decisions about the design and structural behaviour of the project.",
              "Since the end of 2016, the technology offered by virtual reality glasses has been used to carry out three-dimensional simulations.",
              "This technology allows us to reduce the work times in projection.",
              "The Sagrada Familia will have a total of eighteen towers.",
              "In 2018, only eight have been completed and the six central towers are being built: that of Jesus Christ, that of the Virgin Mary and of the four evangelists.",
              "The towers are built with stone panels that serve both as a decorative and structural material.",
              "These panels have been developed with the innovative technique of tensioned stone.",
              "The tensioning technique is based on drilling the pieces of stone with circular holes to be able to introduce metal bars of stainless steel.",
              "In this way a group of about fifteen to twenty pieces are grouped and tensed forming a panel.",
              "This technique greatly accelerates the construction time since the panels: In the following video, discover how towers are being built with these panels.",
              "The completion date for the Sagrada Familia has been postponed several times.",
              "Some people say that they have been more interested in keeping it unfinished until now because of the attractiveness of a slow but constant change.",
              "In March 2017 the journalist Antoni Bassas interviewed the current architect director of the Sagrada Familia (Jordi Fauli\u0301) and asked him if he could assure that the Sagrada Familia would end in 2026.",
              "His answer was: The director does not commit to the completion of the artistic part, although he assures that they are working with a team of theologians.",
              "Think that in 2026 there will surely be sculptures and symbols to be made.",
              "The Construction Board of the Sagrada Familia is an ecclesiastical foundation created in 1895 and whose objective is the administration of the budgets and the fulfillment of the construction project of the Basilica.",
              "This Foundation only has power over the site of its property that in the year 1895 belonged to the old municipality of Sant Marti\u0301 de Provenc\u0327als, which was annexed to Barcelona in 1897.",
              "The site of the Sagrada Familia has functioned as an \"independent republic\" for many years and in 2018 the Temple still has no building license.",
              "It has always been built without the municipal inspectors having reviewed the work.",
              "The work to be done outside the site are the responsibility of the Barcelona City Council, which does not have a clear plan on how to complete access to the main fac\u0327ade.",
              "This access implies the construction of a stairway above Mallorca street, the demolition of several buildings and the relocation of hundreds of people.",
              "The City Council of 2018 says that the urban issue that affects access to the fac\u0327ade of La Gloria is not a priority.",
              "Meanwhile, yes, they have decided to put order to the construction and its construction license.",
              "The municipal consistory is sensitive to the problems of mass tourism in the neighbourhood and consider that it is the Construction Board who must take the initiative and move the piece if it is interested in making the stairway.",
              "The relations between the temple and the different municipal consistories have varied depending on their political colour.",
              "The problem is that the consistories last four years, and when the change takes place, the new government disregards what the previous one decided.",
