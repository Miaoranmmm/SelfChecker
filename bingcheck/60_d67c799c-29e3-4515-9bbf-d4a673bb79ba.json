    "response": "Starry Night is one of Vincent van Gogh's most celebrated works. He painted it in 1889, while he was staying at an asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, France, after suffering a mental breakdown[^2^]. He was inspired by the view from his window, which he described in a letter to his brother Theo: \u201cThis morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big.\u201d[^1^] He also wrote to his sister Willemien that he was fascinated by the night sky and its colors and stars[^3^]. He used his imagination and memory to create a swirling and expressive landscape that contrasts the calm and peaceful village below. Some astronomers have tried to identify the stars and planets that he depicted in his painting, such as Venus, the moon, and the constellation Aries[^4^].",

              "The setting is one that viewers can relate to and van Gogh \u0301s swirling sky directs the viewer \u0301s eye around the painting, with spacing between the stars and the curving contours creating a dot-to-dot effect.",
              "These internal elements ensure fluidity and such contours were important for the artist even though they were becoming less significant for other Impressionists.",
              "Thus Starry Night \u0301s composition was distinct from the Impressionist technique of the 19th century.",
              "The artist was aware that his Starry Night composition was somewhat surreal and stylized and in a letter to his brother he even referred to \"exaggerations in terms of composition.",
              "\" The vivid style chosen by van Gogh was unusual - he chose lines to portray this night scene when silhouettes would have been a more obvious choice.",
              "In Starry Night contoured forms are a means of expression and they are used to convey emotion.",
              "Many feel that van Gogh \u0301s turbulent quest to overcome his illness is reflected in the dimness of the night sky.",
              "The village is painted with dark colors but the brightly lit windows create a sense of comfort.",
              "The village is peaceful in comparison to the dramatic night sky and the silence of the night can almost be felt in Starry Night.",
              "The steeple dominates the village and symbolizes unity in the town.",
              "In terms of composition, the church steeple gives an impression of size and isolation.",
              "In the left foreground is a curvy cypress tree which is typically associated with mourning.",
              "It is painted in the same way as the sky with fluid lines which enhances the flow of the Starry Night painting well as its easiness on the eye.",
              "Starry Night Vincent van Gogh Van Gogh \u0301s choice of color in Starry Night has been much debated, particularly the dominance of yellow in this and other late works.",
              "Some believe van Gogh may have been suffering from lead poisoning or a type of brain disease and that this explains his strange use of color in later paintings.",
              "Van Gogh's use of white and yellow creates a spiral effect and draws attention to the sky.",
              "Vertical lines such as the cypress tree and church tower softly break up the composition without retracting from the powerful night sky depicted in Starry Night.",
              "Vincent van Gogh \u0301s choice of dark blues and greens were complemented with touches of mint green showing the reflection of the moon.",
              "The buildings in the centre of the painting are small blocks of yellows, oranges, and greens with a dash of red to the left of the church.",
              "The dominance of blue in Starry Night is balanced by the orange of the night sky elements.",
              "Van Gogh paints the rich colors of the night and this corresponds with the true character of this Starry Night, whereby colors are used to suggest emotion.",
              "Starry Night Vincent van Gogh Van Gogh \u0301s passion for nighttime is evident in the Starry Night painting, where the powerful sky sits above the quiet town.",
              "It seems that van Gogh is contrasting life and death with luminous stars and a gloomy, peaceful village.",
              "The main light sources are the bright stars and crescent moon.",
              "Starry Night Vincent van Gogh There are various interpretations of Starry Night and one is that this canvas depicts hope.",
              "It seems that van Gogh was showing that even with a dark night such as this it is still possible to see light in the windows of the houses.",
              "Furthermore, with shining stars filling the sky, there is always light to guide you.",
              "It seems that van Gogh was finally being cured of his illness and had essentially found his heaven.",
              "He also knew that in death he would be at peace and further portrays this by using bold colors in the Starry Night painting.",
              "In a letter to his brother, Theo, van Gogh comments: \"I should not be surprised if you liked the Starry Night and the Ploughed Fields, there is a greater quiet about them than in the other canvases.",
              "\" Later in the letter he makes reference to Leo Tolstoys book My Religion and its lack of belief in resurrection.",
              "Such fleeting mentions of religion echoed van Goghs feelings towards the subject at this time;",
              "he could neither forget it nor totally accept it.",
              "Despite this, his use of the word 'quiet' and reference to Tolstoys book indicates that the night sky made him feel calm and brought to mind eternity.",
              "Starry Night shows the vast power of nature and the church spire and cypress tree - representing man and nature - both point to the heavens.",
              "Starry Night Vincent van Gogh In Starry Night van Gogh \u0301s unique, thick brush strokes are very much obvious and it \u0301s possible that his severe attacks further dramatized his brush work.",

              "[10][11] Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived,[12] allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.",
              "[13] During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum in Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",

              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",

              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",

              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",

              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",
              "Amid all this animation, a structured village sits in the distance on the lower right of the canvas.",
              "Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills.",
              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",
              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",
              "The painting was one of van Gogh\u2019s late works, as he committed suicide the following year.",
              "His artistic career was brief, comprising only 10 years, but it was very productive.",
              "He left more than 800 paintings and 700 to 850 drawings to his brother.",
              "When the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City purchased The Starry Night from a private collector in 1941, it was not well known, but it has since become one of van Gogh\u2019s most famous, if not one of the most recognized, works in the art history canon."

              "[10][11] Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived,[12] allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.",
              "[13] During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum in Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.",

              "Two days later, Vincent wrote to Theo stating that he had painted \"a starry sky\".",
              "[21][L 1] The Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window.",
              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",

              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",

              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",

              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",

              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",

              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",

              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",
              "These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.",
              "[63] Harvard astronomer Charles A.",
              "Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of The Starry Night contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.",
              "C.",
              "L.",
              "A.)",
              ".",
              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",
              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",
              "Theo's widow Jo became the caretaker of Van Gogh's legacy.",
              "In Paris in 1900 she sold the painting to poet Julien Leclercq.",
              "In 1901 Leclercq sold it to Gauguin's old friend E\u0301mile Schuffenecker.",
              "Jo bought the painting back from Schuffenecker and in 1906 sold it to the Oldenzeel Gallery in Rotterdam.",
              "From 1906 to 1938 it was owned by Georgette P.",
              "van Stolk, of Rotterdam, who sold it to Paul Rosenberg, of Paris and New York.",
              "It was through Rosenberg that the Museum of Modern Art acquired the painting in 1941.",
              "[83] The painting was investigated by the scientists at the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.",
              "[84] The pigment analysis has shown that the sky was painted with ultramarine and cobalt blue, and for the stars and the moon, Van Gogh employed the rare pigment indian yellow together with zinc yellow.",

              "Starry Night:10 Secrets of Vincent van Gogh Night Stars Painting",
              "Widely hailed as Van Gogh's magnum opus, this Vincent van Gogh night stars painting depicts the view outside his sanatorium room window at night, although it was painted from memory during the day.",
              "Starry Night depicts a dreamy interpretation of the artist's asylum room's sweeping view of Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence.",
              "Though Van Gogh revisited this scene in his work on several occasions, \"Starry Night\" is the only nocturnal study of the view.",
              "Thus, in addition to descriptions evident in the myriad of letters he wrote to his brother, Theo, it offers a rare nighttime glimpse into what the artist saw while in isolation.",
              "\"Through the iron-barred window I can make out a square of wheat in an enclosure,\" he wrote in May of 1889, \"above which in the morning I see the sunrise in its glory.\"",
              "An end-of-the-world cataclysm invades Van Gogh's Starry Night, one of apocalypse filled with melting aerolites and comets adrift.",
              "One has the impression that the artist has expelled his inner conflict onto a canvas.",
              "Everything here is brewed in a huge cosmic fusion.",
              "The sole exception is the village in the foreground with its architectural elements.",
              "Several months after painting Starry Night, in Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo, he wrote: Why, I say to myself, should the spots of light in the firmament be less accessible to us than the black spots on the map of France?",
              ".",
              ".",
              ".",
              "Just as we take the train to go to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to go to a star.\"",
              "The artist is looking down on a village from an imaginary viewpoint.",
              "It is framed by his newly-discovered motifs: at left a cypress towers skywards, at right a group of olive trees cluster into the cloud, and against the horizon run the undulating waves of the Alpilles.",
              "Van Gogh's treatment of his motifs prompts associations with fire, mist and the sea,and the elemental power of the natural scene combines with the intangible cosmic drama of the stars.",
              "The eternal natural universe cradles the human settlement idyllically, yet also surrounds it menacingly.",
              "The village itself might be anywhere, Saint-Remy or Nuenen recalled in a nocturnal mood.",
              "The church spire seems to be stretching up into the elements, at once an antenna and a lightning conductor, like some kind of provincial Eiffel Tower (the fascination of which was never far from van Gogh's nocturnes).",
              "Van Gogh's mountains and trees (particularly the cypresses) had hardly been discovered but they seemed to crackle with an electric charge.",
              "Confident that he had grasped their natural appearance, van Gogh set out to remake their image in the service of the symbolic.",
              "Together with the firmament, these landscape features are singing the praises of Creation in this painting.",
              "Van Gogh described this night stars painting in his letter to his brother Theo: I have done another landscape with olive trees, and a new study of the 'starry sky'.",
              "Although I have not seen the new pictures by Gauguin and Bernard, I am fairly certain that these two studies are similarly conceived.",
              "When you see them some time [.",
              ".",
              ".]",
              "I shall be able to give you a better idea of the things Gauguin, Bernard and I often used to talk about and occupy ourselves with than I can do in words;",
              "it is not a return to Romanticism or to religious ideas, no.",
              "But via Delacroixone can express more of Nature and the country, by means of colour and an individual drawing style, than might appear.\"",
              "Van Gogh is making various points here.",
              "First, his synthesis of motifs was his first echo of work with Gauguin since his breakdown.",
              "The night stars scene (this is something that had only just become important to Van Gogh) offers the visual imagination its most distinctive, unique field of activity, since the lack of light requires the compensatory use of visual memory.",
              "Van Gogh used the memory method in his nocturnal scene;",
              "his discovery of the luminous power of darkness was a personal aesthetic discovery and needed no Gauguin as catalyst.",
              "Second, Van Gogh was drawing upon his long-lost model Euge\u0300ne Delacroix again, and the principle of contrast;",
              "once he paused to reflect on what he had achieved in recent weeks he found his attention drawn back to the colourist techniques which he himself had developed so far.",
              "Third, he was searching for the essence of the landscape, its very being - a way of registering its symbolic power, its vitality, its flux and constancy, all in one.",
              "Interpretations of this Van Gogh night stars painting are legion.",
              "Some claim it is a perfectly realistic account of the position of the stars in June 1889.",
              "This, needless to say, is perfectly possible.",
              "But the twisting, spiraling lines have nothing to do with the Northern Lights or the Milky Way or some spiral nebula or other.",
              "Others say that van Gogh was expressing a personal Gethsemane;",
              "they back this up by referring to the discussion of Christ on the Mount of Olives that he was currently engaged in, in his correspondence with Gauguin and Bernard.",
              "This too may be so;",
              "it is possible that premonitions of sufferings to come are articulated in the picture.",
              "But Biblical allegory is present throughout van Gogh's oeuvre, and he had no need of a special motif, least of all a starry sky, with all its associations of Arles and Utopian visions.",
              "Rather, van Gogh was trying to summarize;",
              "and his resume juxtaposed natural, scientific, philosophical and personal elements.",
              "Starry Night is an attempt to express a state of shock, and the cypresses, olive trees and mountains had acted as van Gogh's catalyst.",
              "More intensely, perhaps, than ever before, Van Gogh was interested in the material actuality of his motifs as much as in their symbolic dimensions.",
              "There had been hills in Arles too, of course.",
              "But they entered his panoramic scenes as idyllic touches.",
              "His landscapes included the harvest, passing trains, isolated farmsteads and distant towns;",
              "and the hills were simply one more detail.",
              "In Arles, Van Gogh's dream had been of the harmony of things and of the spatial dimensions in which that harmony could be felt.",
              "None of that remained.",
              "The hills rose up steep and abruptly now, menacing, threatening to drag the lonesome soul down into vertiginous depths.",
              "The Starry Night has risen to the peak of artistic achievements.",
              "Although Van Gogh sold only one painting in his whole life, \"Starry Night\" is an icon of modern art, the Mona Lisa for our time.",
              "As Leonardo da Vinci evoked a Renaissance ideal of serenity and self-control, Van Gogh defined how we see our own age - wracked with solitude and uncertainty.",
              "Since 1941 Starry Night has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.",
              "1) Vincent Van Gogh painted \"Starry Night\" in 1889 from a room in the mental asylum at Saint-Remy where was recovering from mental illness and his ear amputation.",
              "2) Van Gogh painted the view from his east-facing window in the asylum 21 times.",
              "Although the series depicts various times of day and night and different weather conditions, all the works include the line of rolling hills in the distance.",
              "None show the bars on the window of his room.",
              "3) The artist considered \"The Starry Night,\" which one day would rank among his most famous works, to be a failure, according to what he wrote to his brother.",
              "4) Physicist Jose Luis Aragon compared the turbulent play of light and dark in such works as \"Starry Night\" to the mathematical expression of turbulence in such natural occurrences as as whirlpools and air streams. He found they matched very closely.",
              "Two other Van Gogh paintings from 1890, WheatField with Crows and Road with Cypress and Star also feature this mathematical parallel.",
              "Aragon suggests that since the artist created these particular artworks during periods of extreme mental agitation, Van Gogh was uniquely able to accurately communication that agitation using precise gradations of luminescence.",
              "5) Analysts of \"Starry Night\" emphasize the symbolism of the stylized cypress tree in the foreground, linking it to death and Van Gogh's eventual suicide.",
              "However, the cypress also represents immortality.",
              "In the painting, the tree reaches into the sky, serving as a direct connection between the earth and the heavens.",
              "The artist may have been making more of a hopeful statement than many credit him with.",
              "This positive interpretation of the cypress symbolism hearkens back to a letter to his brother in which the artist likened death to a train that travels to the stars.",
              "6) In his 2015 book, \"Cosmographics,\" Michael Benson contends that the inspiration behind the distinctive swirls in the sky of Van Gogh's \"Starry Night\" is an 1845 drawing by astronomer William Parsons, Earl of Rosse, of the Whirlpool Galaxy.",
              "7) Research has confirmed that the dominant morning star in the painting is actually Venus, which was in a similar position at the time Van Gogh was working on \"Starry Night,\" and it would have shone brightly, just as Van Gogh painted it.",

              "a\u0302\u0080\u009d Art historians have determined that Van Gogh took some liberties with the view from his second-story bedroom window, a theory supported by the fact that the studio in which he painted was on the buildinga\u0302\u0080\u0099s first floor.",
              "He also left out the windowa\u0302\u0080\u0099s less-than-welcoming bars, a detail he included in another letter to Theo.",
              "In May 1889, he wrote, a\u0302\u0080\u009cthrough the iron-barred window I can see an enclosed square of wheat, a prospect like a Van Goyen, above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory.",

              "But the year before, Van Gogh created his original Starry Night, sometimes known as Starry Night Over The Rhone.",
              "After his arrival in Arles, France, in 1888, Van Gogh became a bit obsessed with capturing the lights of the night sky.",
              "He dabbled in its depiction with CafA\u0303\u00a9 Terrace on the Place du Forum, before daring to make his first Starry Night draft with the view of the Rhone River.",
              "Surveying the works that would become known as his Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Remy series, the artist wrote to Theo, a\u0302\u0080\u009cAll in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me.",
              "a\u0302\u0080\u009d In 1985, UCLA art historian Albert Boime compared Starry Night to a planetarium recreation of how the night sky would have appeared on June 19, 1889.",

              "Following Van Gogha\u0302\u0080\u0099s death in 1890, Theo inherited all of his brothera\u0302\u0080\u0099s works.",
              "But when he died in the fall of 1891, his wife Johanna GezinaA\u0302 van Gogh-Bonger became the owner of The Starry Night and scads of other paintings.",
              "It was Van Gogh-Bonger who collected and edited the brothersa\u0302\u0080\u0099 correspondence for publication, and she is credited with building Van Gogha\u0302\u0080\u0099s posthumous fame, thanks to her tireless promotions of his work and exhibitions.",

              "My Dear Theo, I am writing to you rather reluctantly because, for a good many reasons, I have kept silent for such a long time.",
              "To some extent you have become a stranger to me, and I to you perhaps more than you think.",
              "It is probably better for us not to go on like that.",
              "It is probable that I would not have written to you even now, were it not that I feel obliged, compelled, to do so - because, be it noted, you yourself have compelled me to.",
              "I heard in Etten that you had sent 50 francs for me.",
              "Well, I have accepted them.",
              "With reluctance, of course, with a feeling of some despondency, of course, but I have reached a sort of impasse, am in trouble, what else can I do?",
              "And so I am writing to thank you.",
              "As you may know, I am back in the Borinage.",
              "Father said he would prefer me to stay somewhere near Etten, but I refused and I believe I was right to do so.",
              "To the family, I have, willy-nilly, become a more or less objectionable and shady sort of character, at any rate a bad lot.",
              "How then could I then be of any use to anyone?",
              "And so I am inclined to think the best and most sensible solution all round would be for me to go away and to keep my distance, to cease to be, as it were.",
              "What the moulting season is for birds - the time when they lose their feathers - setbacks, misfortune and hard times are for us human beings.",
              "You can cling on to the moulting season, you can also emerge from it reborn, but it must not be done in public.",
              "The thing is far from amusing, not very exhilarating, and so one should take care to keep out of the way.",
              "Well, so be it.",
              "Now, though it is a fairly hopeless task to regain the trust of an entire family, one which has perhaps never been wholly weaned from prejudice and other equally honourable and respectable qualities, I am not entirely without hope that, bit by bit, slowly but surely, the good relationship between one and all may be restored.",
              "In the first place I should be glad to see this good relationship - to put it no more strongly than that - restored at least between Father and me, and further, I set great store by seeing it restored between the two of us.",
              "A good relationship is infinitely preferable to a misunderstanding.",
              "Now I must trouble you with certain abstract matters, hoping that you will listen to them patiently.",
              "I am a man of passions, capable of and given to doing more or less outrageous things for which I sometimes feel a little sorry.",
              "Every so often I say or do something too hastily, when it would have been better to have shown a little more patience.",
              "Other people also act rashly at times, I think.",
              "This being the case, what can be done about it?",
              "Should I consider myself a dangerous person, unfit for anything?",
              "I think not.",
              "Rather, every means should be tried to put these very passions to good effect.",
              "To mention just one by way of an example, I have a more or less irresistible passion for books and the constant need to improve my mind, to study if you like, just as I have a need to eat bread.",
              "You will understand that.",
              "When I lived in other surroundings, surroundings full of pictures and works of art, I conceived a violent, almost fanatical passion for those surroundings, as you know.",
              "And I do not regret that, and even now, far from home, I often feel homesick for the land of pictures You may remember that I knew very well (and it may be that I know it still) what Rembrandt was or what Millet was or Jules Dupre\u0301 or Delacroix or Millais or Matthijs Maris.",
              "Well, today I am no longer in those surroundings, yet they say that what is known as the soul never dies but lives on for ever, continuing to seek for ever and again.",
              "So instead of succumbing to my homesickness I told myself: your land, your fatherland, is all around.",
              "So instead of giving in to despair I chose active melancholy, in so far as I was capable of activity, in other words I chose the kind of melancholy that hopes, that strives and that seeks, in preference to the melancholy that despairs numbly and in distress.",
              "I accordingly made a more or less serious study of the books within my reach, such as the Bible and Michelet's La re\u0301volution Franc\u0327aise, and then last winter Shakespeare and a little Victor Hugo and Dickens and Beecher Stowe and recently \u00c6schylus and then various less classical writers, a few great minor masters.",
              "You know, don't you, that Fabritius and Bida are counted among the minor masters?",
              "Now anyone who becomes absorbed in all this is sometimes considered outrageous, `shocking,' sinning more or less unwillingly against certain forms and customs and proprieties.",
              "It is a pity that people take that amiss.",
              "You know, for example, that I have often neglected my appearance.",
              "I admit it, and I also admit that it is `shocking.'",
              "But look here, lack of money and poverty have something to do with it too, as well as a profound disillusionment, and besides, it is sometimes a good way of ensuring the solitude you need, of concentrating more or less on whatever study you are immersed in.",
              "One essential study is that of medicine.",
              "There is scarcely anybody who does not try to acquire some knowledge of it, who does not at least try to grasp what it is about (and you see, I still know absolutely nothing about it).",
              "And all these things absorb you, preoccupy you, set you dreaming, musing and thinking.",
              "Now for the past five years or so, I don't know how long exactly, I have been more or less without permanent employment, wandering from pillar to post.",
              "You will say, ever since such and such a time you have been going downhill, you have been feeble, you have done nothing.",
              "Is that entirely true?",
              "What is true is that I have at times earned my own crust of bread, and at other times a friend has given it to me out of the goodness of his heart.",
              "I have lived whatever way I could, for better or for worse, taking things just as they came.",
              "It is true that I have forfeited the trust of various people, it is true that my financial affairs are in a sorry state, it is true that the future looks rather bleak, it is true that I might have done better, it is true that I have wasted time when it comes to earning a living, it is true that my studies are in a fairly lamentable and appalling state, and that my needs are greater, infinitely greater than my resources.",
              "But does that mean going downhill and doing nothing?",
              "You might say, but why didn't you go through with university, continue as they wanted you to?",
              "To that I can only reply that it was too expensive, and besides, the future then looked no better than it does now, along the path I am now taking.",
              "And I must continue to follow the path I take now.",
              "If I do nothing, if I study nothing, if I cease searching, then, woe is me, I am lost.",
              "That is how I look at it - keep going, keep going come what may.",
              "But what is your final goal, you may ask.",
              "That goal will become clearer, will emerge slowly but surely, much as the rough draught turns into a sketch, and the sketch into a painting through the serious work done on it, through the elaboration of the original vague idea and through the consolidation of the first fleeting and passing thought.",
              "You should know that it is the same with evangelists as it is with artists.",
              "There is an old academic school, often odious and tyrannical, the `abomination of desolation', in short, men who dress, as it were, in a suit of steel armour, a cuirass, of prejudice and convention.",
              "When they are in charge, it is they who hand out the jobs and try, with much red tape, to keep them for their proteges and to exclude the man with an open mind.",
              "Their God is like the God of Shakespeare's drunken Falstaff, \u201cthe inside of a church.",
              "\u201d Indeed, by a strange coincidence, some evangelical (?",
              "?",
              "?)",
              "gentlemen have the same view of matters spiritual as that drunkard (which might surprise them somewhat were they capable of human emotion).",
              "But there is little fear that their blindness will ever turn into insight.",
              "This is a bad state of affairs for anyone who differs from them and protests with heart and soul and all the indignation he can muster.",
              "For my part, I hold those academicians who are not like these academicians in high esteem, but the decent ones are thinner on the ground than you might think.",
              "Now, one of the reasons why I have no regular job, and why I have not had a regular job for years, is quite simply that my ideas differ from those of the gentlemen who hand out the jobs to individuals who think as they do.",
              "It is not just a question of my appearance, which is what they have sanctimoniously reproached me with.",
              "It goes deeper, I do assure you.",
              "I am telling you all this not to complain, not to make excuses for matters in which I may perhaps have been somewhat at fault, but simply to tell you the following: during your final visit last summer when we were walking together near that abandoned mineshaft which they call \u201cLa Sorcie\u0300re,\u201d you reminded me of another walk we once took at another time near the old canal and the mill at Rijswijk, and, you said, we used to agree about many things, but, you added, \u201cYou have changed since then, you are no longer the same.",
              "\u201d Well, that is not entirely true.",
              "What has changed is that my life then was less difficult and my future seemingly less gloomy, but as far as my inner self, my way of looking at things and of thinking is concerned, that has not changed.",
              "But if there has indeed been a change, then it is that I think, believe and love more seriously now what I thought, believed and loved even then.",
              "So you would be mistaken should you continue to think that I have become less keen on, say, Rembrandt, Millet, or Delacroix or whoever or whatever, for the reverse is the case, but there are many different things worth believing and loving, you see - there is something of Rembrandt in Shakespeare, something of Correggio or of Sarto in Michelet and something of Delacroix in Victor Hugo, and there is also something of Rembrandt in the Gospel or, if you prefer, something of the Gospel in Rembrandt, it comes to much the same thing, provided you understand it properly, do not try to distort it and bear in mind that the elements of the comparisons are not intended to detract in any way from the merits of the original individuals.",
              "And in Bunyan there is something of M.",
              "Maris or of Millet, a reality that, in a manner of speaking, is more real than reality itself, something hitherto unknown that, if only you can read it, will tell you untold things.",
              "And in Beecher Stowe there is something of Ary Scheffer.",
              "Now, if you can forgive someone for immersing himself in pictures, perhaps you will also grant that the love of books is as sacred as that of Rembrandt, indeed, I believe that the two complement each other.",
              "I very much admire the portrait of a man by Fabritius that we stood looking at for a long time in the gallery in Haarlem one day when we took another walk together.",
              "Admittedly, I am as fond of Dickens's `Richard Cartone' [Sydney Carton] in his Paris & Londres in 1793 [A Tale of Two Cities], and I could point to other particularly gripping characters in other books with a more or less striking resemblance.",
              "And I think that Kent, a character in Shakespeare's \u201cKing Lear,\u201d is as noble and distinguished a man as that figure by Th.",
              "de Keyser, though Kent and King Lear are reputed to have lived much earlier.",
              "Let me stop there, but my God, how beautiful Shakespeare is, who else is as mysterious as he is;",
              "his language and method are like a brush trembling with excitement and ecstasy.",
              "But one must learn to read, just as one must learn to see and learn to live.",
              "So please don't think that I am renouncing anything, I am reasonably faithful in my unfaithfulness and though I have changed, I am the same, and what preys on my mind is simply this one question: what am I good for, could I not be of service or use in some way, how can I become more knowledgeable and study some subject or other in depth?",
              "That is what keeps preying on my mind, you see, and then one feels imprisoned by poverty, barred from taking part in this or that project and all sorts of necessities are out of one's reach.",
              "As a result one cannot rid oneself of melancholy, one feels emptiness where there might have been friendship and sublime and genuine affection, and one feels dreadful disappointment gnawing at one's spiritual energy, fate seems to stand in the way of affection or one feels a wave of disgust welling up inside.",
              "And then one says \u201cHow long, my God!",
              "\u201d Well, that's how it is, can you tell what goes on within by looking at what happens without?",
              "There may be a great fire in our soul, but no one ever comes to warm himself by it, all that passers-by can see is a little smoke coming out of the chimney, and they walk on.",
              "All right, then, what is to be done, should one tend that inward fire, turn to oneself for strength, wait patiently - yet with how much impatience!",
              "- wait, I say, for the moment when someone who wants to comes and sits down beside one's fire and perhaps stays on?",
              "Let him who believes in God await the moment that will sooner or later arrive.",
              "Well, right now it seems that things are going very badly for me, have been doing so for some considerable time, and may continue to do so well into the future.",
              "But it is possible that everything will get better after it has all seemed to go wrong.",
              "I am not counting on it, it may never happen, but if there should be a change for the better I should regard that as a gain, I should rejoice, I should say, at last!",
              "So there was something after all!",
              "But, you will say, what a dreadful person you are, with your impossible religious notions and idiotic scruples.",
              "If my ideas are impossible or idiotic then I would like nothing better than to be rid of them.",
              "But this is roughly the way I see things.",
              "In Le Philosophe sous les Toits by Souvestre you can read what a man of the people, a simple craftsman, pitiful if you will, thinks of his country: \u201cTu n'as peut-e\u0302tre jamais pense\u0301 a\u0300 ce que c'est la patrie, reprit-il, en me posant une main sur l'e\u0301paule;",
              "c'est tout ce qui t'entoure, tout ce qui t'a e\u0301leve\u0301 et nourri, tout ce que tu as aime\u0301.",
              "Cette campagne que tu vois, ces maisons, ces arbres, ces jeunes filles qui passent la\u0300 en riant, c'est la patrie!",
              "Les lois qui te prote\u0300gent, le pain qui paye ton travail, les paroles que tu e\u0301changes, la joie et la tristesse qui te viennent des hommes et des choses parmi lesquels tu vis, c'est la patrie!",
              "La petite chambre ou\u0300 tu as autrefois vu ta me\u0300re, les souvenirs qu'elle t'a laisse\u0301s, la terre ou\u0300 elle repose, c'est la patrie!",
              "Tu la vois, tu la respires partout!",
              "Figure toi, tes affections et tes besoins, tes souvenirs et ta reconnaissance, re\u0301unis tout c\u0327a sous un seul nom et ce nom sera la patrie.",
              "\u201d [You may never have thought what your country really is, he continued, placing his hand on my shoulder;",
              "it is everything around you, everything that has raised and nourished you, everything that you have loved.",
              "This countryside that you see;",
              "these houses, these trees, these young girls laughing as they pass, that is your country!",
              "The laws that protect you, the bread that rewards your labour, the words you speak, the joy and sorrow that come from the people and things in whose midst you live, that is your country!",
              "The little room where you used in days gone by to see your mother, the memories she left you, the earth in which she rests, that is your country!",
              "You see it, you breathe it, everywhere!",
              "Imagine your rights and your duties, your affections and your needs, your memories and your gratitude, gather all that together under a single name, and that name will be your country.]",
              "In the same way I think that everything that is really good and beautiful, the inner, moral, spiritual and sublime beauty in men and their works, comes from God, and everything that is bad and evil in the works of men and in men is not from God, and God does not approve of it.",
              "But I cannot help thinking that the best way of knowing God is to love many things.",
              "Love this friend, this person, this thing, whatever you like, and you will be on the right road to understanding Him better, that is what I keep telling myself.",
              "But you must love with a sublime, genuine, profound sympathy, with devotion, with intelligence, and you must try all the time to understand Him more, better and yet more.",
              "That will lead to God, that will lead to an unshakeable faith.",
              "To take an example: one man will love Rembrandt, genuinely, and that man will surely know that there is a God, he will really believe it.",
              "Another will make a thorough study of the French Revolution - he will not be an unbeliever, he will see that there is a supreme authority that manifests itself in great affairs.",
              "Yet another has recently attended a free course of lectures at the great university of sorrow and has heeded the things he saw with his eyes and heard with his ears, and has reflected upon them.",
              "He too will come to believe in the end and will perhaps have learned more than he can tell.",
              "Try to grasp the essence of what the great artists, the serious masters, say in their masterpieces, and you will again find God in them.",
              "One man has written or said it in a book, another in a painting.",
              "Just read the Bible and the Gospel, that will start you thinking, thinking about many things, thinking about everything, well then, think about many things, think about everything, that will lift your thoughts above the humdrum despite yourself.",
              "We know how to read, so let us read!",
              "Now then, you may well have bouts of being a little absent-minded, a little dreamy, indeed there are some who become too absent-minded, a little too dreamy.",
              "That may indeed have happened with me, but all in all that is my own fault, maybe there as a reason for it, perhaps I was lost in thought for one reason or another, anxious, worried, but one gets over that in the end.",
              "The dreamer sometimes falls into the doldrums, but is said to emerge from them again.",
              "And the absent-minded person also makes up for it with bouts of perspicacity.",
              "Sometimes he is a person whose right to exist has a justification that is not always immediately obvious to you, or more usually, you may absent-mindedly allow it to slip from your mind.",
              "Someone who has been wandering about for a long time, tossed to and fro on a stormy sea, will in the end reach his destination.",
              "Someone who has seemed to be good for nothing, unable to fill any job, any appointment, will find one in the end and, energetic and capable, will prove himself quite different from what he seemed at first.",
              "I am writing somewhat at random, writing whatever flows from my pen.",
              "I should be very happy if you could see in me something more than a kind of faine\u0301ant [idler].",
              "For there is a great difference between one idler and another idler.",
              "There is someone who is an idler out of laziness and lack of character, owing to the baseness of his nature.",
              "If you like, you may take me for one of those.",
              "Then there is the other kind of idler, the idler despite himself, who is inwardly consumed by a great longing for action who does nothing because his hands are tied, because he is, so to speak, imprisoned somewhere, because he lacks what he needs to be productive, because disastrous circumstances have brought him forcibly to this end.",
              "Such a one does not always know what he can do, but he nevertheless instinctively feels, I am good for something!",
              "My existence is not without reason!",
              "I know that I could be a quite a different person!",
              "How can I be of use, how can I be of service?",
              "There is something inside me, but what can it be?",
              "He is quite another idler.",
              "If you like you may take me for one of those.",
              "A caged bird in spring knows perfectly well that there is some way in which he should be able to serve.",
              "He is well aware that there is something to be done, but he is unable to do it.",
              "What is it?",
              "He cannot quite remember, but then he gets a vague inkling and he says to himself, \u201cThe others are building their nests and hatching their young and bringing them up,\u201d and then he bangs his head against the bars of the cage.",
              "But the cage does not give way and the bird is maddened by pain.",
              "\u201cWhat a idler,\u201d says another bird passing by - what an idler.",
              "Yet the prisoner lives and does not die.",
              "There are no outward signs of what is going on inside him;",
              "he is doing well, he is quite cheerful in the sunshine.",
              "But then the season of the great migration arrives, an attack of melancholy.",
              "He has everything he needs, say the children who tend him in his cage - but he looks out, at the heavy thundery sky, and in his heart of hearts he rebels against his fate.",
              "I am caged, I am caged and you say I need nothing, you idiots!",
              "I have everything I need, indeed!",
              "Oh!",
              "please give me the freedom to be a bird like other birds!",
              "A kind of idler of a person resembles that kind of idler of a bird.",
              "And people are often unable to do anything, imprisoned as they are in I don't know what kind of terrible, terrible, oh such terrible cage.",
              "I do know that there is a release, the belated release.",
              "A justly or unjustly ruined reputation, poverty, disastrous circumstances, misfortune, they all turn you into a prisoner.",
              "You cannot always tell what keeps you confined, what immures you, what seems to bury you, and yet you can feel those elusive bars, railings, walls.",
              "Is all this illusion, imagination?",
              "I don't think so.",
              "And then one asks: My God!",
              "will it be for long, will it be for ever, will it be for eternity?",
              "Do you know what makes the prison disappear?",
              "Every deep, genuine affection.",
              "Being friends, being brothers, loving, that is what opens the prison, with supreme power, by some magic force.",
              "Without these one stays dead.",
              "But whenever affection is revived, there life revives.",
              "Moreover, the prison is sometimes called prejudice, misunderstanding, fatal ignorance of one thing or another, suspicion, false modesty.",
              "But to change the subject - if I have come down in the world, you have in a different way come up in it.",
              "And if I have forfeited sympathy, you have gained it.",
              "I am glad of that, I say that it in all sincerity, and it will always give me pleasure.",
              "If you lacked seriousness or consideration, I would be fearful that it might not last, but since I think that you are very serious and very considerate, I tend to believe it will!",
              "But if you could see me as something other than a idler of the bad sort, I should be very happy.",
              "For the rest, if I can ever do anything for you, be of some use to you, know that I am at your disposal.",
              "Now that I have accepted what you have given me, you are, should I be able to render you some service, in a position to ask me.",
              "It would make me happy, and I should take it a sign of trust.",
              "We have moved rather far apart and may in certain respects have perhaps different views, but some time, some day, one of us may be of service to the other.",
              "For now I shake your hand, thanking you once again for having been so good to me.",
              "If, one of these days, you feel like writing, my address is, chez Ch.",
              "Decrucq, Rue du Pavillon 8, Cuesmes, near Mons, and know that it will do me good to hear from you.",
              "Yours, Vincent My Dear Theo, I am writing to you rather reluctantly because, for a good many reasons, I have kept silent for such a long time.",
              "To some extent you have become a stranger to me, and I to you perhaps more than you think.",
              "It is probably better for us not to go on like that.",
              "It is probable that I would not have written to you even now, were it not that I feel obliged, compelled, to do so - because, be it noted, you yourself have compelled me to.",
              "I heard in Etten that you had sent 50 francs for me.",
              "Well, I have accepted them.",
              "With reluctance, of course, with a feeling of some despondency, of course, but I have reached a sort of impasse, am in trouble, what else can I do?",
              "And so I am writing to thank you.",
              "As you may know, I am back in the Borinage.",
              "Father said he would prefer me to stay somewhere near Etten, but I refused and I believe I was right to do so.",
              "To the family, I have, willy-nilly, become a more or less objectionable and shady sort of character, at any rate a bad lot.",
              "How then could I then be of any use to anyone?",
              "And so I am inclined to think the best and most sensible solution all round would be for me to go away and to keep my distance, to cease to be, as it were.",

              "You can cling on to the moulting season, you can also emerge from it reborn, but it must not be done in public.",
              "The thing is far from amusing, not very exhilarating, and so one should take care to keep out of the way.",
              "Well, so be it.",
              "Now, though it is a fairly hopeless task to regain the trust of an entire family, one which has perhaps never been wholly weaned from prejudice and other equally honourable and respectable qualities, I am not entirely without hope that, bit by bit, slowly but surely, the good relationship between one and all may be restored.",
              "In the first place I should be glad to see this good relationship - to put it no more strongly than that - restored at least between Father and me, and further, I set great store by seeing it restored between the two of us.",
              "A good relationship is infinitely preferable to a misunderstanding.",
              "Now I must trouble you with certain abstract matters, hoping that you will listen to them patiently.",

              "Every so often I say or do something too hastily, when it would have been better to have shown a little more patience.",
              "Other people also act rashly at times, I think.",
              "This being the case, what can be done about it?",
              "Should I consider myself a dangerous person, unfit for anything?",
              "I think not.",
              "Rather, every means should be tried to put these very passions to good effect.",
              "To mention just one by way of an example, I have a more or less irresistible passion for books and the constant need to improve my mind, to study if you like, just as I have a need to eat bread.",
              "You will understand that.",
              "When I lived in other surroundings, surroundings full of pictures and works of art, I conceived a violent, almost fanatical passion for those surroundings, as you know.",
              "And I do not regret that, and even now, far from home, I often feel homesick for the land of pictures You may remember that I knew very well (and it may be that I know it still) what Rembrandt was or what Millet was or Jules Dupre\u0301 or Delacroix or Millais or Matthijs Maris.",
              "Well, today I am no longer in those surroundings, yet they say that what is known as the soul never dies but lives on for ever, continuing to seek for ever and again.",
              "So instead of succumbing to my homesickness I told myself: your land, your fatherland, is all around.",
              "So instead of giving in to despair I chose active melancholy, in so far as I was capable of activity, in other words I chose the kind of melancholy that hopes, that strives and that seeks, in preference to the melancholy that despairs numbly and in distress.",
              "I accordingly made a more or less serious study of the books within my reach, such as the Bible and Michelet's La re\u0301volution Franc\u0327aise, and then last winter Shakespeare and a little Victor Hugo and Dickens and Beecher Stowe and recently \u00c6schylus and then various less classical writers, a few great minor masters.",
              "You know, don't you, that Fabritius and Bida are counted among the minor masters?",
              "Now anyone who becomes absorbed in all this is sometimes considered outrageous, `shocking,' sinning more or less unwillingly against certain forms and customs and proprieties.",
              "It is a pity that people take that amiss.",
              "You know, for example, that I have often neglected my appearance.",
              "I admit it, and I also admit that it is `shocking.'",
              "But look here, lack of money and poverty have something to do with it too, as well as a profound disillusionment, and besides, it is sometimes a good way of ensuring the solitude you need, of concentrating more or less on whatever study you are immersed in.",
              "One essential study is that of medicine.",
              "There is scarcely anybody who does not try to acquire some knowledge of it, who does not at least try to grasp what it is about (and you see, I still know absolutely nothing about it).",
              "And all these things absorb you, preoccupy you, set you dreaming, musing and thinking.",
              "Now for the past five years or so, I don't know how long exactly, I have been more or less without permanent employment, wandering from pillar to post.",

              "Is that entirely true?",
              "What is true is that I have at times earned my own crust of bread, and at other times a friend has given it to me out of the goodness of his heart.",
              "I have lived whatever way I could, for better or for worse, taking things just as they came.",
              "It is true that I have forfeited the trust of various people, it is true that my financial affairs are in a sorry state, it is true that the future looks rather bleak, it is true that I might have done better, it is true that I have wasted time when it comes to earning a living, it is true that my studies are in a fairly lamentable and appalling state, and that my needs are greater, infinitely greater than my resources.",
              "But does that mean going downhill and doing nothing?",
              "You might say, but why didn't you go through with university, continue as they wanted you to?",
              "To that I can only reply that it was too expensive, and besides, the future then looked no better than it does now, along the path I am now taking.",
              "And I must continue to follow the path I take now.",
              "If I do nothing, if I study nothing, if I cease searching, then, woe is me, I am lost.",

              "But what is your final goal, you may ask.",
              "That goal will become clearer, will emerge slowly but surely, much as the rough draught turns into a sketch, and the sketch into a painting through the serious work done on it, through the elaboration of the original vague idea and through the consolidation of the first fleeting and passing thought.",
              "You should know that it is the same with evangelists as it is with artists.",
              "There is an old academic school, often odious and tyrannical, the `abomination of desolation', in short, men who dress, as it were, in a suit of steel armour, a cuirass, of prejudice and convention.",

              "For my part, I hold those academicians who are not like these academicians in high esteem, but the decent ones are thinner on the ground than you might think.",
              "Now, one of the reasons why I have no regular job, and why I have not had a regular job for years, is quite simply that my ideas differ from those of the gentlemen who hand out the jobs to individuals who think as they do.",

              "\u201d Well, that is not entirely true.",

              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",

              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",

              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",
              "The painting was one of van Gogh\u2019s late works, as he committed suicide the following year.",
              "His artistic career was brief, comprising only 10 years, but it was very productive.",

              "When the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City purchased The Starry Night from a private collector in 1941, it was not well known, but it has since become one of van Gogh\u2019s most famous, if not one of the most recognized, works in the art history canon."

              "It is framed by his newly-discovered motifs: at left a cypress towers skywards, at right a group of olive trees cluster into the cloud, and against the horizon run the undulating waves of the Alpilles.",
              "Van Gogh's treatment of his motifs prompts associations with fire, mist and the sea,and the elemental power of the natural scene combines with the intangible cosmic drama of the stars.",
              "The eternal natural universe cradles the human settlement idyllically, yet also surrounds it menacingly.",

              "Together with the firmament, these landscape features are singing the praises of Creation in this painting.",

              "Van Gogh is making various points here.",
              "First, his synthesis of motifs was his first echo of work with Gauguin since his breakdown.",
              "The night stars scene (this is something that had only just become important to Van Gogh) offers the visual imagination its most distinctive, unique field of activity, since the lack of light requires the compensatory use of visual memory.",
              "Van Gogh used the memory method in his nocturnal scene;",
              "his discovery of the luminous power of darkness was a personal aesthetic discovery and needed no Gauguin as catalyst.",
              "Second, Van Gogh was drawing upon his long-lost model Euge\u0300ne Delacroix again, and the principle of contrast;",
              "once he paused to reflect on what he had achieved in recent weeks he found his attention drawn back to the colourist techniques which he himself had developed so far.",
              "Third, he was searching for the essence of the landscape, its very being - a way of registering its symbolic power, its vitality, its flux and constancy, all in one.",
              "Interpretations of this Van Gogh night stars painting are legion.",
              "Some claim it is a perfectly realistic account of the position of the stars in June 1889.",
              "This, needless to say, is perfectly possible.",
              "But the twisting, spiraling lines have nothing to do with the Northern Lights or the Milky Way or some spiral nebula or other.",
              "Others say that van Gogh was expressing a personal Gethsemane;",
              "they back this up by referring to the discussion of Christ on the Mount of Olives that he was currently engaged in, in his correspondence with Gauguin and Bernard.",
              "This too may be so;",
              "it is possible that premonitions of sufferings to come are articulated in the picture.",
              "But Biblical allegory is present throughout van Gogh's oeuvre, and he had no need of a special motif, least of all a starry sky, with all its associations of Arles and Utopian visions.",
              "Rather, van Gogh was trying to summarize;",
              "and his resume juxtaposed natural, scientific, philosophical and personal elements.",
              "Starry Night is an attempt to express a state of shock, and the cypresses, olive trees and mountains had acted as van Gogh's catalyst.",
              "More intensely, perhaps, than ever before, Van Gogh was interested in the material actuality of his motifs as much as in their symbolic dimensions.",
              "There had been hills in Arles too, of course.",
              "But they entered his panoramic scenes as idyllic touches.",
              "His landscapes included the harvest, passing trains, isolated farmsteads and distant towns;",
              "and the hills were simply one more detail.",
              "In Arles, Van Gogh's dream had been of the harmony of things and of the spatial dimensions in which that harmony could be felt.",
              "None of that remained.",
              "The hills rose up steep and abruptly now, menacing, threatening to drag the lonesome soul down into vertiginous depths.",
              "The Starry Night has risen to the peak of artistic achievements.",
              "Although Van Gogh sold only one painting in his whole life, \"Starry Night\" is an icon of modern art, the Mona Lisa for our time.",
              "As Leonardo da Vinci evoked a Renaissance ideal of serenity and self-control, Van Gogh defined how we see our own age - wracked with solitude and uncertainty.",
              "Since 1941 Starry Night has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.",
              "1) Vincent Van Gogh painted \"Starry Night\" in 1889 from a room in the mental asylum at Saint-Remy where was recovering from mental illness and his ear amputation.",
              "2) Van Gogh painted the view from his east-facing window in the asylum 21 times.",
              "Although the series depicts various times of day and night and different weather conditions, all the works include the line of rolling hills in the distance.",
              "None show the bars on the window of his room.",
              "3) The artist considered \"The Starry Night,\" which one day would rank among his most famous works, to be a failure, according to what he wrote to his brother.",
              "4) Physicist Jose Luis Aragon compared the turbulent play of light and dark in such works as \"Starry Night\" to the mathematical expression of turbulence in such natural occurrences as as whirlpools and air streams. He found they matched very closely.",
              "Two other Van Gogh paintings from 1890, WheatField with Crows and Road with Cypress and Star also feature this mathematical parallel.",
              "Aragon suggests that since the artist created these particular artworks during periods of extreme mental agitation, Van Gogh was uniquely able to accurately communication that agitation using precise gradations of luminescence.",
              "5) Analysts of \"Starry Night\" emphasize the symbolism of the stylized cypress tree in the foreground, linking it to death and Van Gogh's eventual suicide.",
              "However, the cypress also represents immortality.",
              "In the painting, the tree reaches into the sky, serving as a direct connection between the earth and the heavens.",
              "The artist may have been making more of a hopeful statement than many credit him with.",
              "This positive interpretation of the cypress symbolism hearkens back to a letter to his brother in which the artist likened death to a train that travels to the stars.",
              "6) In his 2015 book, \"Cosmographics,\" Michael Benson contends that the inspiration behind the distinctive swirls in the sky of Van Gogh's \"Starry Night\" is an 1845 drawing by astronomer William Parsons, Earl of Rosse, of the Whirlpool Galaxy.",
              "7) Research has confirmed that the dominant morning star in the painting is actually Venus, which was in a similar position at the time Van Gogh was working on \"Starry Night,\" and it would have shone brightly, just as Van Gogh painted it.",
              "8) The moon in the painting would not have been in the crescent phase as shown at the time Van Gogh painted \"Starry Night.\"",
              "In reality, it would have been gibbous, or about three-quarters full.",
              "9) Pathologist Paul Wolf postulated in 2001 that the artist's fondness for yellow in paintings like \"Starry Night\" resulted from taking too much digitalis, a treatment in his day for epilepsy.",
              "10) Where is Vincent van Gogh Starry Night painting?",

              "The Starry Night, a moderately abstract landscape painting (1889) of an expressive night sky over a small hillside village, one of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh\u2019s most celebrated works.",
              "The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.",
              "One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.",
              "Amid all this animation, a structured village sits in the distance on the lower right of the canvas.",
              "Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills.",
              "The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting\u2019s turbulence.",
              "Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.",
              "While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.",
              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",
              "The painting was one of van Gogh\u2019s late works, as he committed suicide the following year.",
              "His artistic career was brief, comprising only 10 years, but it was very productive.",
              "He left more than 800 paintings and 700 to 850 drawings to his brother.",
              "When the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City purchased The Starry Night from a private collector in 1941, it was not well known, but it has since become one of van Gogh\u2019s most famous, if not one of the most recognized, works in the art history canon."

              "The Starry Night (Dutch: De sterrennacht) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh.",
              "Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.",
              "[1][2][3] It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P.",
              "Bliss Bequest.",
              "Widely regarded as Van Gogh's magnum opus,[4][5] The Starry Night is one of the most recognizable paintings in Western art.",
              "[6][7] In the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear,[8][9] Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889.",
              "[10][11] Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived,[12] allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.",
              "[13] During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum in Saint-Re\u0301my-de-Provence, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.",
              "[14] During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J.",
              "Paul Getty Museum, and the blue self-portrait from September 1889, in the Muse\u0301e d'Orsay.",
              "The Starry Night was painted mid-June by around 18 June, the date he wrote to his brother Theo to say he had a new study of a starry sky.",
              "[1][15][16][L 1] Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory.",
              "The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east,[1][2][17][18] a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times,[citation needed] including The Starry Night.",
              "\"Through the iron-barred window,\" he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, \"I can see an enclosed square of wheat .",
              ".",
              ".",
              "above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory.\"",
              "[2][L 2] Van Gogh depicted the view at different times of the day and under various weather conditions, such as the sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain.",
              "While the hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, he was able there to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper;",
              "eventually, he would base newer variations on previous versions.",
              "The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains.",
              "In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field.",
              "Van Gogh exaggerated their size in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.",
              "One of the first paintings of the view was F611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Re\u0301my, now in Copenhagen.",
              "Van Gogh made a number of sketches for the painting, of which F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm is typical.",
              "It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside.",
              "In his 9 June letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days.",
              "[19][20][L 3][15] Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889.",
              "[19][L 4] This is F719 Green Wheat Field with Cypress, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he definitely painted en plein air.",
              "[19] F1548 Wheatfield, Saint-Re\u0301my de Provence, now in New York, is a study for it.",
              "Two days later, Vincent wrote to Theo stating that he had painted \"a starry sky\".",
              "[21][L 1] The Starry Night is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window.",
              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",
              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",
              "[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse (F1541r) was also a study for the painting.",
              "[23] F1548 Wheatfield, Saint-Re\u0301my de Provence, Morgan Library & Museum F719 Green Wheat Field with Cypress, National Gallery Prague F1547 The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm, Van Gogh Museum F611 Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Re\u0301my, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek F1541v Bird's-Eye View of the Village, Van Gogh Museum F1541r Landscape with Cypresses, Van Gogh Museum Despite the large number of letters Van Gogh wrote, he said very little about The Starry Night.",
              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",
              "When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he did not send.",
              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",
              ".",
              ".",
              ".",
              "But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big\u2014another failure\u2014and I have had my fill of that.\"",
              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",
              "These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.",
              "[63] Harvard astronomer Charles A.",
              "Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of The Starry Night contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.",
              "C.",
              "L.",
              "A.)",
              ".",
              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",
              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",
