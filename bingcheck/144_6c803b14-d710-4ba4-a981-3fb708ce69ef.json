    "response": "That's a great question. Designing a spacecraft that can successfully land on a planet with vastly different atmospheric and surface conditions than Earth is a very challenging task that requires careful planning, testing and innovation. Some of the factors that engineers and scientists have to consider are:\n\n- The distance and duration of the mission, which affect the communication, power and reliability of the spacecraft.\n- The gravity and terrain of the planet, which affect the landing speed, accuracy and stability of the spacecraft.\n- The atmosphere and weather of the planet, which affect the aerodynamics, heating and parachuting of the spacecraft.\n- The scientific objectives and instruments of the mission, which affect the size, weight and complexity of the spacecraft.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, engineers and scientists have approached this problem in various ways, such as:\n\n- Using advanced propulsion systems, such as ion engines or nuclear thermal rockets, to reduce the travel time and fuel consumption of the spacecraft.\n- Using adaptive guidance and control systems, such as thrusters or retro-rockets, to adjust the trajectory and attitude of the spacecraft during descent and landing.\n- Using innovative landing systems, such as airbags, skycranes or inflatable heat shields, to protect the spacecraft from impact and deliver it safely to the surface.\n- Using robotic lander prototypes, such as NASA's Mighty Eagle or Morpheus[^3^], to test and demonstrate new technologies and capabilities for landing on other planets.\n\nAs you can see, landing on other planets is not an easy feat, but it is possible with human ingenuity and perseverance.\ud83d\ude80",

              "Both distance and duration demand that spacecraft must have systems that can reliably operate far from home, be capable of keeping astronauts alive in case of emergencies and still be light enough that a rocket can launch it.",
              "Artemis Missions near the Moon will start when NASA\u2019s Orion spacecraft leaves Earth atop the world\u2019s most powerful rocket, NASA\u2019s Space Launch System.",
              "After launch from the agency\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Orion will travel beyond the Moon to a distance more than 1,000 times farther than where the International Space Station flies in low-Earth orbit, and farther than any spacecraft built for humans has ever ventured.",
              "To accomplish this feat, Orion has built-in technologies that enable the crew and spacecraft to explore far into the solar system.",
              "Systems to Live and Breathe As humans travel farther from Earth for longer missions, the systems that keep them alive must be highly reliable while taking up minimal mass and volume.",
              "Orion will be equipped with advanced environmental control and life support systems designed for the demands of a deep space mission.",
              "A high-tech system already being tested aboard the space station will remove carbon dioxide (CO2) and humidity from inside Orion.",
              "Removal of CO2 and humidity is important to ensure air remains safe for the crew breathing.",
              "And water condensation on the vehicle hardware is controlled to prevent water intrusion into sensitive equipment or corrosion on the primary pressure structure.",
              "The system also saves volume inside the spacecraft.",
              "Without such technology, Orion would have to carry many chemical canisters that would otherwise take up the space of 127 basketballs (or 32 cubic feet) inside the spacecraft\u2014about 10 percent of crew livable area.",
              "Orion will also have a new compact toilet, smaller than the one on the space station.",
              "Long duration missions far from Earth drive engineers to design compact systems not only to maximize available space for crew comfort, but also to accommodate the volume needed to carry consumables like enough food and water for the entirety of a mission lasting days or weeks.",
              "Highly reliable systems are critically important when distant crew will not have the benefit of frequent resupply shipments to bring spare parts from Earth, like those to the space station.",
              "Even small systems have to function reliably to support life in space, from a working toilet to an automated fire suppression system or exercise equipment that helps astronauts stay in shape to counteract the zero-gravity environment in space that can cause muscle and bone atrophy.",
              "Distance from home also demands that Orion have spacesuits capable of keeping astronaut alive for six days in the event of cabin depressurization to support a long trip home.",
              "Proper Propulsion The farther into space a vehicle ventures, the more capable its propulsion systems need to be to maintain its course on the journey with precision and ensure its crew can get home.",
              "Orion has a highly capable service module that serves as the powerhouse for the spacecraft, providing propulsion capabilities that enable Orion to go around the Moon and back on its exploration missions.",
              "The service module has 33 engines of various sizes.",
              "The main engine will provide major in-space maneuvering capabilities throughout the mission, including inserting Orion into lunar orbit and also firing powerfully enough to get out of the Moon\u2019s orbit to return to Earth.",
              "The other 32 engines are used to steer and control Orion on orbit.",
              "In part due to its propulsion capabilities, including tanks that can hold nearly 2,000 gallons of propellant and a back up for the main engine in the event of a failure, Orion\u2019s service module is equipped to handle the rigors of travel for missions that are both far and long, and has the ability to bring the crew home in a variety of emergency situations.",
              "The Ability to Hold Off the Heat Going to the Moon is no easy task, and it\u2019s only half the journey.",
              "The farther a spacecraft travels in space, the more heat it will generate as it returns to Earth.",
              "Getting back safely requires technologies that can help a spacecraft endure speeds 30 times the speed of sound and heat twice as hot as molten lava or half as hot as the sun.",
              "When Orion returns from the Moon, it will be traveling nearly 25,000 mph, a speed that could cover the distance from Los Angeles to New York City in six minutes.",
              "Its advanced heat shield, made with a material called AVCOAT, is designed to wear away as it heats up.",
              "Orion\u2019s heat shield is the largest of its kind ever built and will help the spacecraft withstand temperatures around 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit during reentry though Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
              "Before reentry, Orion also will endure a 700-degree temperature range from about minus 150 to 550 degrees Fahrenheit.",
              "Orion\u2019s highly capable thermal protection system, paired with thermal controls, will protect Orion during periods of direct sunlight and pitch black darkness while its crews will comfortably enjoy a safe and stable interior temperature of about 77 degrees Fahrenheit.",
              "Radiation Protection As a spacecraft travels on missions beyond the protection of Earth\u2019s magnetic field, it will be exposed to a harsher radiation environment than in low-Earth orbit with greater amounts of radiation from charged particles and solar storms that can cause disruptions to critical computers, avionics and other equipment.",
              "Humans exposed to large amounts of radiation can experience both acute and chronic health problems ranging from near-term radiation sickness to the potential of developing cancer in the long-term.",
              "Orion was designed from the start with built in system-level features to ensure reliability of essential elements of the spacecraft during potential radiation events.",
              "For example, Orion is equipped with four identical computers that each are self-checking, plus an entirely different backup computer, to ensure Orion can still send commands in the event of a disruption.",
              "Engineers have tested parts and systems to a high standard to ensure that all critical systems remain operable even under extreme circumstances.",
              "Orion also has a makeshift storm shelter below the main deck of the crew module.",
              "In the event of a solar radiation event, NASA has developed plans for crew on board to create a temporary shelter inside using materials on board.",
              "A variety of radiation sensors will also be on the spacecraft to help scientists better understand the radiation environment far away from Earth.",
              "One investigation called AstroRad, will fly on Artemis I and test an experimental vest that has the potential to help shield vital organs and decrease exposure from solar particle events.",
              "Constant Communication and Navigation Spacecraft venturing far from home go beyond the Global Positioning System (GPS) in space and above communication satellites in Earth orbit.",
              "To talk with mission control in Houston, Orion will use all three of NASA\u2019s space communications networks.",
              "As it rises from the launch pad and into cislunar space, Orion will switch from the Near Earth Network to the Space Network, made possible by the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites, and finally to the Deep Space Network that provides communications for some of NASA\u2019s most distant spacecraft.",
              "Orion is also equipped with backup communication and navigation systems to help the spacecraft stay in contact with the ground and orient itself if it\u2019s primary systems fail.",
              "The backup navigation system, a relatively new technology called optical navigation, uses a camera to take pictures of the Earth, Moon and stars and autonomously triangulate Orion\u2019s position from the photos.",
              "Its backup emergency communications system doesn\u2019t use the primary system or antennae for high-rate data transfer.",
              "NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery."

              "6 min read After a nearly seven-month journey to Mars, NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover is slated to land at the Red Planet\u2019s Jezero Crater Feb.",
              "18, 2021, a rugged expanse chosen for its scientific research and sample collection possibilities.",
              "But the very features that make the site fascinating to scientists also make it a relatively dangerous place to land \u2013 a challenge that has motivated rigorous testing here on Earth for the lander vision system (LVS) that the rover will count on to safely touch down.",
              "\u201cJezero is 28 miles wide, but within that expanse there are a lot of potential hazards the rover could encounter: hills, rock fields, dunes, the walls of the crater itself, to name just a few,\u201d said Andrew Johnson, principal robotics systems engineer at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.",
              "\u201cSo, if you land on one of those hazards, it could be catastrophic to the whole mission.",
              "\u201d Enter Terrain-Relative Navigation (TRN), the mission-critical technology at the heart of the LVS that captures photos of the Mars terrain in real time and compares them with onboard maps of the landing area, autonomously directing the rover to divert around known hazards and obstacles as needed.",
              "\u201cFor Mars 2020, LVS will use the position information to figure out where the rover is relative to safe spots between those hazards.",
              "And in one of those safe spots is where the rover will touch down,\u201d explained Johnson.",
              "If Johnson sounds confident that LVS will work to land Perseverance safely, that\u2019s because it allows the rover to determine its position relative to the ground with an accuracy of about 200 feet or less.",
              "That low margin of error and high degree of assurance are by design, and the result of extensive testing both in the lab and in the field.",
              "\u201cWe have what we call the trifecta of testing,\u201d explained JPL\u2019s Swati Mohan, guidance, navigation, and control operations lead for Mars 2020.",
              "Mohan said that the first two testing areas \u2013 hardware and simulation \u2013 were done in a lab.",
              "\u201cThat\u2019s where we test every condition and variable we can.",
              "Vacuum, vibration, temperature, electrical compatibility \u2013 we put the hardware through its paces,\u201d said Mohan.",
              "\u201cThen with simulation, we model various scenarios that the software algorithms may encounter on Mars \u2013 a too-sunny day, very dark day, windy day \u2013 and we make sure the system behaves as expected regardless of those conditions.",
              "\u201d But the third piece of the trifecta \u2013 the field tests \u2013 require actual flights to put the lab results through further rigor and provide a high level of technical readiness for NASA missions.",
              "For LVS\u2019s early flight tests, Johnson and team mounted the LVS to a helicopter and used it to estimate the vehicle\u2019s position automatically as it was flying.",
              "\u201cThat got us to a certain level of technical readiness because the system could monitor a wide range of terrain, but it didn\u2019t have the same kind of descent that Perseverance will have,\u201d said Johnson.",
              "\u201cThere was also a need to demonstrate LVS on a rocket.",
              "\u201d That need was met by NASA\u2019s Flight Opportunities program, which facilitated two 2014 flights in the Mojave Desert on Masten Space Systems\u2019 Xombie \u2013 a vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL) system that functions similarly to a lander.",
              "The flight tests demonstrated LVS\u2019s ability to direct Xombie to autonomously change course and avoid hazards on descent by adopting a newly calculated path to a safe landing site.",
              "Earlier flights on Masten\u2019s VTVL system also helped validate algorithms and software used to calculate fuel-optimal trajectories for planetary landings.",
              "\u201cTesting on the rocket laid pretty much all remaining doubts to rest and answered a critical question for the LVS operation affirmatively,\u201d said JPL\u2019s Nikolas Trawny, a payload and pointing control systems engineer who worked closely with Masten on the 2014 field tests.",
              "\u201cIt was then that we knew LVS would work during the high-speed vertical descent typical of Mars landings.",
              "\u201d Johnson added that the suborbital testing in fact increased the technology readiness level to get the final green light of acceptance into the Mars 2020 mission.",
              "\u201cThe testing that Flight Opportunities is set up to provide was really unprecedented within NASA at the time,\u201d said Johnson.",
              "\u201cBut it\u2019s proven so valuable that it\u2019s now becoming expected to do these types of flight tests.",

              "Generally it has been used in solar orbit, to increase a spacecraft's velocity and propel it outward in the solar system, much farther away from the Sun than its launch vehicle would have been capable of doing.",
              "Since a flyby can also decrease a spacecraft's orbital momentum, the Galileo spacecraft decreased its energy, relative to Jupiter, with a gravity assist flyby in front of the Jovian moon Io.",

              "Disturbances in a gas generally propagate at the speed of sound.",

              "In air, the speed of sound is about 343 metres per second at average sea-level conditions.",

              "1, or 10% the speed of sound.",

              "3, we can pretend the fluid is incompressible and still get fairly accurate calculations, simplifying the mathematical models used.",
              "However, in rocket engines and high-speed aerodynamics, the flow is so violent that gas compressibility can no longer be ignored.",
              "Unfortunately, this also means that the flows become much more difficult to model.",
              "When a vehicle moves through air at high Mach numbers, the air has less time to get out of the object\u2019s way.",
              "This means that it gets compressed by the vehicle\u2019s motion more strongly.",
              "When the object starts moving faster than the speed of sound (at supersonic speed), the real fun begins.",
              "Because the disturbances caused by the vehicle\u2019s motion cannot keep up with the vehicle, the soundwaves \u2018pile up\u2019 in front of it and form a shock.",
              "Shocks are less than one micron thick.",
              "Immediately in front of the shock, the air is undisturbed, blissfully unaware of the vehicle\u2019s approach.",
              "The shock forms because the oncoming air suddenly encounters the vehicle\u2019s surface without warning and does not have time to get out of the way.",
              "The air gets violently compressed as it passes through the shock, causing its pressure, density, and temperature to jump almost instantaneously.",

              "Shocks can come in many different shapes shapes depending on the flow and the vehicle\u2019s geometry, but here are some common examples: Understanding shock physics and geometry is crucial to aircraft and rocket design.",
              "At the speeds rockets fly through the atmosphere, shocks can cause parts of the rocket to overheat from the high temperatures or to suffer structural failure from the increased pressures.",
              "They also increase the drag generated by the vehicle, meaning that the engines have to work harder to push the rocket through the atmosphere.",
              "Rocket nozzles themselves rely on the formation of a \u2018normal shock\u2019 inside them to accelerate the exhaust to supersonic speeds.",

              "When flying through an atmosphere, different design considerations are required depending on airspeed.",
              "To understand these varying considerations, NASA divides atmospheric flight into six speed regimes.",

              "Transonic speeds are around Mach 1.",
              "In this regime, some parts of the airflow are supersonic, while others are still subsonic.",
              "The reason for this is that the shape of the vehicle\u2019s body may accelerate subsonic airflows to supersonic speeds, while other parts may decelerate supersonic airflows to subsonic speeds.",
              "Most commercial airliners fly at these speeds.",
              "Transonic effects are most commonly seen on the wings of the aircraft.",
              "The curvature accelerates the airflow to supersonic speeds, then a shock forms when the air loses enough energy to become subsonic again: Because the properties of the airflow change so drastically when it passes through a shock, shock formation can cause serious problems. In the transonic regime, the sudden jump in air pressure and density can cause control instabilities, increase drag, and reduce lift.",
              "Here, the normal laws of aerodynamics begin to break down.",
              "These issues are what made the sound barrier so difficult to break.",
              "Nevertheless, it was broken in 1947 by Chuck Yeager.",

              "Today, advancements in aerodynamics and engineering allow aircraft to fly at and faster than the transonic regime.",
              "Supersonic speeds occur between Mach 1 and 3.",
              "In this regime, the airflow is faster than sound everywhere on the vehicle\u2019s body.",
              "Because of this, vehicles are generally easier to control in the supersonic regime than in the transonic one.",
              "However, special considerations are still required in designing the airframe \u2013 for example, sharp noses and very thin wings become optimal, which is opposite to what is best for the subsonic regime.",

              "However, launch vehicles the Space Shuttle or Falcon 9 still use lightweight aluminum-lithium alloy despite travelling much faster than the SR-71 in the atmosphere.",
              "Why?",
              "Aircraft need to fly (relatively) low in the atmosphere to supply their engines with oxygen, requiring them to fly through denser air for long periods of time.",

              "On the other hand, launch vehicles, powered by rocket engines, don\u2019t need the atmosphere.",
              "In fact, they try to get out of the atmosphere as quickly as possible to minimize drag losses.",
              "As a result, by the time they reach high supersonic speeds during ascent, their altitude is so high that aerothermal heating is relatively mild.",
              "Hypersonic speeds occur between Mach 5 and 10.",
              "This is where things start to get interesting.",

              "Blunt noses become optimal again.",

              "Aircraft flying at this speed may need to use special cooling systems for their airframes.",
              "This introduces several new engineering headaches.",
              "To understand what goes on at hypersonic speeds, we need to understand what it means for a gas to be hot.",

              "Normally, this isn\u2019t much of a concern.",
              "However, at the temperatures encountered in hypersonic flight, the various different ways the molecule\u2019s bonds can vibrate start to strongly affect the gas\u2019s ability to absorb heat (or its heat capacity.)",
              "Because thermodynamics becomes so important at these speeds, both to keep the vehicle from overheating and to predict the gas\u2019s fluid properties, designers must account for this.",
              "At higher speeds and temperatures, the heat can begin breaking molecules apart.",
              "Diatomic nitrogen and oxygen begin breaking up into single atoms: a phenomenon known as dissociation.",

              "Plasma is found in many places in nature, from the Sun to lightning bolts to the insides of neon lights.",
              "Because it conducts electricity3, the ionization of gas around a hypersonic vehicle can interfere with radio communications.",
              "This is why spacecraft often experience communications blackouts during their return to Earth.",
              "The coup de gra\u0302ce of these design and modelling headaches is that even the fundamental mechanisms by which heat is transferred within the gas changes.",
              "In everyday life and in normal flight, a gas disperses heat through convection (by molecules moving in bulk) and conduction (by molecules transmitting their vibrations to each other.)",
              "At hypersonic speeds, the air is so hot that it begins to become incandescent, transferring heat by radiation.",
              "This radiation is the reason that spacecraft and meteors trail brilliantly glowing plasma when they reenter the atmosphere.",
              "All in all, the hypersonic regime is an extremely difficult regime to fly in;",
              "not just because most air-breathing engines become useless or because the thrust required to maintain these speeds is so enormous, but also because the air itself begins to break down (along with the conventional laws of aerodynamics).",
              "Sustained powered hypersonic flight is rare;",
              "ascending rockets are usually in the near-vacuum upper regions of the atmosphere by the time they reach these speeds.",

              "At such extreme speeds, the vehicle\u2019s design is at the mercy of shock heating due to the extreme temperatures reached.",
              "Temperatures easily reach thousands of degrees Celsius, weakening and melting most conventional aircraft materials.",
              "Notice that spacecraft designed to survive re-entry feature non-aerodynamic, blunt designs, which generate a lot of drag: Alternatively, spaceplanes like the Space Shuttle are designed to enter the atmosphere at a steep angle, which also cause a large amount of drag: While generating drag is needed to slow down from orbital velocities, the bluntness of the spacecraft\u2019s aerodynamic profile also helps reduce heating.",
              "Recall how the shapes of the shocks in front of the vehicle vary according to its geometry: Notice that the arrow-shaped body on the top-left has a shock that is attached to it.",
              "Because the shock is where the air is heated, an attached shock could overheat the vehicle at hypersonic and re-entry speeds.",
              "On the other hand, all the other blunt-shaped bodies have detached shocks, which are separated from them by a small distance.",
              "This reduces the amount of heat transferred to them, although it drastically increases the drag generated.",
              "Hence, spacecraft tend to enter the atmosphere with their blunt ends forward, reducing the heat the spacecraft must withstand and improving braking.",
              "Despite these aerodynamic tricks, the hull of the spacecraft may still reach thousands of degrees Celsius.",
              "The Space Shuttle\u2019s hull reached 1,650 \u00b0C while reentering from low-Earth orbit, for example, which would melt titanium.",
              "It is not sufficient for a material to simply remain solid at these temperatures \u2013 it must also maintain its structural strength, which means that the real maximum temperature has to be well below its melting point.",
              "So, to withstand these temperatures, the Space Shuttle\u2019s hull was made from special TPS (Thermal Protection System) tiles.",
              "The underside of the hull, which hit the atmosphere first, was made from ceramic tiles containing low-density silica fiber with a black borosilicate outer shell: Silica fibers can withstand high temperatures, and their low density makes them excellent insulators.",
              "These properties allowed the TPS tiles to absorb enormous amounts of heat while insulating the shuttle\u2019s aluminum frame, keeping it from reaching high temperatures.",
              "After re-entry, the black coating helped to dissipate heat by radiation.",

              "Traditional spacecraft are very expensive, and to reduce risk, the avionics may employ redundancy such that if one element fails, the entire architecture is able to continue, but SmallSat avionics designs are more centralized, whereby if one element fails, the system fails.",

              "Some of the more pertinent issues and concerns that all small spacecraft missions must address include: In addition to CDH and FSW, state-of-the-art SSA systems should consider the following subsystem/payload specific electronic systems: Flight payload and subsystems avionics elements include: Modular avionics architectures for small spacecraft can be characterized as either federated or integrated.",
              "In a federated avionics architecture, each subsystem of the spacecraft is considered an independent, dedicated autonomous element, with the avionic components performing all functions independently and exchanging data over standardized communications protocols and interfaces.",

              "The increased need for synchronization, intersatellite communications, controlled positioning for integrated CDH functionality, coordination and conduct, operation of ConOps, and autonomous operations impose new constraints on the avionics system.",
              "This is true not only for single satellites, but now also for multi-satellite configurations, whereby overall mission performance is dependent on all the platform elements acting in a co-dependent fashion.",
              "Current trends in small spacecraft CDH generally appear to be following those of previous, larger scale CDH subsystems. The current generation of microprocessors can easily handle the processing requirements of most CDH subsystems and will likely be sufficient for use in spacecraft bus designs for the foreseeable future.",
              "Cost and availability are likely primary factors for selecting a CDH subsystem design from a given manufacturer, but many groups develop their own custom platforms. The ability to spread nonrecurring engineering costs over multiple missions and reduce software development through reuse are both desirable factors in a competitive market.",

              "These distinguishing features, spaceflight heritage and radiation tolerance, are the primary differentiators in the parts selection process for long-term missions, verses those which rely heavily on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) parts.",
              "Experimental missions typically focus on low-cost, easy-to-develop systems that take advantage of open-source software and hardware to provide an easy entry into space systems development, especially for hobbyists or those who lack specific spacecraft expertise.",
              "Small spacecraft CDH technologies and capabilities have been continuously evolving, enabling new opportunities for developing and deploying next-generation SSA.",

              "As spacecraft manufacturers begin to use more space-qualified parts, they find that those devices can often lag their COTS counterparts by several generations in performance but may be the only means to meet the radiation requirements placed on the system.",
              "Presently, there are several commercial vendors who offer highly integrated systems that contain the onboard computer, memory, electrical power system (EPS), and the ability to support a variety of Input & Output (I/O) for the CubeSat class of small spacecraft.",
              "A variety of CDH developments for CubeSats have occurred due to in-house development, the rise of new companies that specialize in CubeSat avionics, and the use of parts from established companies who provide spacecraft avionics for the space industry in general.",
              "While parallel developments are impacting the growth of CubeSats, vendors with ties to the more traditional spacecraft bus market are increasing CDH processing capabilities within their product lines.",
              "In-house designs for CDH units are being developed by some spacecraft bus vendors to better accommodate small vehicle concepts.",
              "While these items generally exceed CubeSat form factors in size, they can achieve similar environmental performance and may be useful in small satellite systems that replicate more traditional spacecraft subsystem distribution.",
              "The CompactPCI and PC/104 form factors continue generally to be the industry standard for CubeSat CDH bus systems, with multiple vendors offering components that can be readily integrated into space-rated systems. Overall, form factors should fit within the standard CubeSat dimension of less than 10 \u00d7 10 cm2.",
              "Spacecraft avionics components are performance-driven and not necessarily dependent on spacecraft platform sizes, but some noncontainerized spacecraft platforms may need to consider using higher TRL avionics products and whether or not these products are available.",
              "The PC/104 form factor was the original inspiration to define standard architecture and interface configurations for CubeSat processors, but with space at a premium, many vendors have been using all available space exceeding the formal PC/104 board size.",
              "Although the PC/104 board dimension continues to inspire CubeSat configurations, some vendors have made modifications to stackable interface connectors to address reliability and throughput concerns.",
              "Many vendors have adopted the use of stackable \u201cdaughter\u201d or \u201cmezzanine\u201d boards to simplify connections between subsystem elements and payloads, and to accommodate advances in technologies that maintain compatibility with existing designs.",

              "FPGAs and software-defined architectures also give designers a level of flexibility to integrate uploadable software modifications to adapt to new requirements and interfaces.",
              "Table 8-1 summarizes the current state-of-the-art for some of these components.",
              "Since traditional CubeSat designs are based primarily on COTS parts, spacecraft vendors often try to use parts that have radiation tolerance or have been radiation-hardened, as noted in the pedigree column in table 8-1.",

              "Some larger, more sophisticated computing systems have significantly more processing capability than what is traditionally used in SmallSat CDH systems, however the increase in processing power may be a useful tradeoff if payload processing and CDH functions can be combined (note that overall throughput should be analyzed to assure proper functionality under the most stressful operating conditions).",

              "Some landers, such as Philae and the Apollo Lunar Module, land entirely by using their fuel supply, however many landers (and landings of spacecraft on Earth) use aerobraking, especially for more distant destinations.",
              "This involves the spacecraft using a fuel burn to change its trajectory so it will pass through a planet (or a moon's) atmosphere.",
              "Drag caused by the spacecraft hitting the atmosphere enables it to slow down without using fuel, however this generates very high temperatures and so adds a requirement for a heat shield of some sort.",

              "After 30 years in service from 1981 to 2011 and 135 flights, the shuttle was retired from service due to the cost of maintaining the shuttles, and the 3 remaining orbiters (the other two were destroyed in accidents) were prepared to be displayed in museums. Some spacecraft do not fit particularly well into any of the general spacecraft categories.",

              "It consists of two stages: the Super Heavy booster and a spacecraft known as Starship.",
              "The rocket is 121 metres tall (397 feet) when both stages are stacked together, and is 9 metres (30 ft) wide, excluding the four side flaps of the Starship second stage.",

              "They both land using an engine burn, which makes them the only reusable orbital rockets or rocket stages (all orbital rockets have been multistage rockets as of 2023) to do so other than the first stage of SpaceX's own Falcon 9 and the side boosters of its Falcon Heavy rocket.",
              "Starship is designed to be capable of lifting 150 tonnes (330,000 lb) to orbit in reusable configuration and 250 tonnes (550,000 lb) if expended.",
              "What makes this more impressive is the fact that the Super Heavy booster will return to its launch site, meaning it must have enough fuel to send the Starship on a suborbital trajectory then reverse its direction of travel.",
              "[21] The Falcon 9 and Heavy boosters have the option to land on drone ships away from the launch pad, then be transported back to the launch pad to reduce the fuel spent on returning to the landing pad and increase payload.",

              "Despite its massive size, the launch system is unable to carry any payload on an escape trajectory alone.",
              "Doing so requires either the use of separate stages contained in the large cargo bay or refueling the Starship in orbit using specialised tanker Starships, however the latter is, as of September 2023, unproven technology.",
              "Because it is fully reusable, it is hoped that it will drastically reduce the cost of space exploration, with its Raptor engines designed to be used many times without maintenance.",
              "This could be especially beneficial for science missions, which often have to compete with others for funding, and end up being cancelled or scaled back because of budget limitations.",
              "The low launch cost and the payload capacity of Starship could also allow probes to use more common and cheaper materials rather than light, expensive ones, such as glass, instead of beryllium for large telescope mirrors.",
              "However, according to Eurospace's director of research, Pierre Lionnet, low launch cost might not reduce the overall cost of a science mission significantly: of the Rosetta space probe and Philae lander's mission cost of $1.",
              "7 billion, the cost of launch (by the expendable Ariane 5) only made up ten percent.",
              "[24] The spacecraft is 50 metres (164 ft) long and has three sea level optimised Rapor engines used for landing and three Raptor Vacuum engines with a larger nozzle for greater efficiency in space, which give it a total of 1500 tonnes (3.",
              "3 million pounds) of thrust.",
              "[21] When returning from space, the Starship spacecraft will reenter the atmosphere using its four side flaps to control its orientation and increase drag, turn about 90 degrees to a vertical position and land using an engine burn.",

              "More notably, the guidance employed by SpaceX for the Falcon 9 landing also utilizes this type of strategy [5].",
              "Landing guidance strategy This type of online strategy is necessary for the landing phase due to its challenging nature, since a feasible trajectory must be computed from an initial condition which has accumulated considerable dispersions from previous phases, to a precise final position with an accuracy of a few meters.",
              "Moreover, several operational constraints exist that condition the feasibility of the generated reference trajectory, such as the available propellant, the thrust capabilities of the vehicle, namely, throttling, and attitude constraints, including the maximum angle of attack and a near-vertical final orientation, which more traditional trajectory planning methods do not allow to implicitly satisfy.",
              "The resulting trajectory is then tracked by a low-level and high-frequency attitude controller in the control sub-function, utilizing the available actuators, i.",
              "e., TVC, RCS and ACS.",
              "Furthermore, the guidance is also complemented with an outer control loop that closes the loop between optimizations.",
              "The largest limitation of the selected strategy is the relatively high computational load necessary for solving the optimization problem, which must be sufficiently complex to capture the fast dynamics and constraints of the guidance problem.",
              "The dynamic modelling is the most critical step in the design of this algorithm: the model may be arbitrarily realistic and complex, which improves the fidelity of the guidance output, but also increases the computational effort required to obtain it.",
              "The most important modelling decisions are identified in Table 2.",
              "Therefore, the formulation of the optimal control problem is a trade-off between the fidelity and complexity of the problem, and the computational effort required to solve it.",
              "While a simple 3-DoF model can be linear, introducing attitude dynamics makes the problem highly nonlinear and non-convex.",
              "Furthermore, the modelling of drag forces introduces a quadratic non-linearity, which may be possible to linearize with sufficient accuracy, and modelling lift forces introduces even more significant non-linearities.",
              "Finally, while modelling the change of vehicle mass introduces a non-convexity in the dynamic model and thrust constraints, a lossless convexification technique is available [6], which makes the problem linear without loss of generality or optimality.",
              "Another important design decision in the formulation of the optimal control problem is the online optimization of the landing burn duration.",
              "The engine ignition and shutdown time instants may be variables of the optimization, in which case the guidance selects the optimal values that minimize the propellant mass, or these values may be fixed a priori.",
              "As can be expected, free final-time and free initial-time optimal control problems make the problem non-convex and, therefore, harder to optimize than fixed-time problems. This guidance strategy also allows for the implicit satisfaction of operational constraints: the optimal control approach generates a trajectory and attitude that, apart from perturbations, lead the vehicle to the landing site while simultaneously satisfying those constraints.",
              "Examples of relevant constraints are reported in Table 3.",
              "Similarly to the dynamic modelling, these constraints have different complexities and may possibly render the problem non-convex.",
              "For example, while the terminal state constraint is a simple linear and convex constraint, the angle of attack constraint is highly non-convex.",
              "The thrust magnitude constraint is also non-convex in the case that the variable mass model is utilized, along with the previously mentioned change of variable, although a lossless convexification of this constraint is possible [6].",
              "The final step in the design of the optimal control problem is the choice of objective function, for which the suitable option is a linear cost function proportional to the propellant expended, which results in the generated trajectory being fuel optimal.",
              "Two possibilities include the maximization of the final mass, or the minimization of the integral of the thrust magnitude.",
              "The selection of the guidance optimization formulation is, therefore, a trade-off between the computational complexity and robustness of solving the OCP in real time, and the fidelity of the resulting trajectory and control profile.",
              "Two main approaches within this framework are identified and discussed next, differing mainly on the dynamic modelling, and consequently also on the method of optimization.",
              "The first and simplest approach relies on employing a simple linear model of the vehicle dynamics (e.",
              "g., 3-DoF, no/linearized aerodynamics, fixed final time, etc.)",
              "and linear or second-order state and control constraints.",
              "This approach yields a convex OCP, therefore, allowing it to be solved with convex programming techniques, namely, second-order cone programming (SOCP) [6].",
              "This is desirable for a real-time application, since there are robust convex programming algorithms with convergence guarantees in polynomial time readily available [12].",
              "To compensate for the low-fidelity dynamic model utilized in the guidance, which results in a trajectory that is increasingly infeasible to track with time, the problem is re-solved periodically with an updated state estimate, thus closing the guidance loop, similar to a model predictive control (MPC) approach.",
              "On the other hand, as previously mentioned, there is a limitation on the guidance re-solve rate, which must be significantly lower than the control frequency to decouple the frequency response of the two sub-functions, which otherwise may interfere in the control closed-loop performance and stability (about 1\u20132 orders of magnitude, see Sect.",
              "5).",
              "The second and more complex approach includes nonlinear dynamic models (e.",
              "g., 6-DoF dynamics, aerodynamics, free final time, etc.)",
              ", which result in a solution with a higher fidelity reference trajectory and control profile, but also in a non-convex optimization problem.",
              "Solving this requires non-linear programming (NLP) algorithms, which are undesirable to use in real-time applications, since they are highly dependent on the initial guess and offer few bounds on the computational effort required to convergence, if any.",
              "On the other hand, convexification techniques represent significant advancements in guidance optimization problems. Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) and successive convexification techniques offer a framework for solving more general non-convex optimal control problems, and do not make use of second-order information as in Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) methodologies.",
              "The work presented here aims at exploiting the benefits of successive convexification techniques: good convergence properties and low computation effort [8].",
              "The basic idea is to successively linearize the dynamic model and constraints around the previous solution, and solve a sequence of SOCP optimizations that iteratively converge to a solution of the original non-linear OCP.",
              "The linearization method exploits the benefits of convexity, but it also introduces two undesired effects, namely, artificial infeasibility and artificial unboundedness [13].",
              "Even if the original non-convex problem is feasible, the convexification through linearization approach could engender infeasibilities in any iteration that will obstruct the algorithm and prevent convergence.",
              "This phenomenon is known as artificial infeasibility.",
              "To prevent this artificial infeasibility, additional control input, typically called virtual control, is introduced to the linear dynamic equations.",
              "The virtual control is unconstrained and makes any state to be reachable in finite time.",
              "Since their magnitude should be as small as possible, it is heavily penalized via an additional term in the objective function.",
              "Another possible strategy to avoid artificial infeasibility consists in relaxing terminal constraints and adding largely penalized optimization variables to the cost function.",
              "Artificial unboundedness comes into sight due to the fact that the iterative linearization approach is a valid approximation of the non-linear function only in the neighborhood of the previous solution.",
              "Therefore, to ensure the validity of linearization, the search space must be bounded via a so-called trust region.",
              "Thus, the states and/or controls are limited to a fixed (hard trust region constraint) or a variable (soft trust region constraint) radius.",
              "In the case of a soft trust region, a penalized weight is added to the objective function and its value is a trade-off between time duration and linearization validity.",
              "Due to the nature of the non-convex problem, the time complexity of this algorithm is naturally higher than performing a single convex optimization, and depends on the degree of nonlinearity of the dynamic model and constraints.",

Preliminary data helped the team determine if the aeroshell was effective at slowing down and surviving the steep dive from low-Earth orbit to the ocean.",
              "The result: \u201ca pretty resounding yes,\u201d said Trudy Kortes, director of technology demonstrations at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate.",

              "On Mars, where the atmosphere is less than 1% the density of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, extra help is needed to create the drag necessary to slow and safely land a spacecraft.",
              "That\u2019s why NASA engineers think a large deployable aeroshell like LOFTID, which inflates and is protected by a flexible heat shield, could put on the brakes while traveling down through the Martian atmosphere.",
              "The aeroshell is designed to create more drag in the upper atmosphere to help the spacecraft slow down sooner, which also prevents some of the superintense heating.",
              "Currently, NASA can land 1 metric ton (2,205 pounds) on the Martian surface, like the car-size Perseverance rover.",

              "In fact, the inflatable structure is in such good condition, it looks like it could be reused and flown again, DiNonno said, but it needs rigorous testing before making such a determination.",
              "There is still a tremendous amount of data to process, including specific temperatures LOFTID faced at different points in its flight.",
              "After the full study is complete, scientists could use the findings to work on the next, larger generation of LOFTID.",

              "Before shipping to Langley, the integrated components were painstakingly packed \u2013 an intensive process in which the aeroshell is gathered in a particular way, turned upside down, gathered again, cinched by hand, flipped again, and then put into a hydraulic ram.",
