    "query": "What was the inspiration behind the famous painting \"The Starry Night\" by Vincent van Gogh, and what techniques did he use to create its unique style?",
    "response": "The Starry Night is one of Vincent van Gogh's most famous paintings. It depicts the view from his window at the **Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum** in Saint-R\u00e9my, in southern France, where he spent twelve months in 1889\u201390 seeking reprieve from his mental illnesses[^5^] [^4^]. He painted it in mid-June 1889, just before sunrise, with the addition of an **imaginary village**[^5^].\n\nThe inspiration for The Starry Night came from a **morning star** that he saw from his window. He wrote to his brother Theo, \u201cThis morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big.\u201d[^1^] [^2^]\n\nThe techniques that he used to create its unique style include **thick brushstrokes**, **swirling patterns**, and **contrasting colors**. He applied the paint with a palette knife and a brush, creating a textured surface that suggests movement and energy. He used blue and yellow as complementary colors to create a vibrant contrast between the sky and the stars, the moon, and the village lights. He also used green and orange to contrast the cypress tree and the wheat field in the foreground. He created swirling patterns in the sky to evoke a sense of turbulence and dynamism, as well as to express his emotions and visions. He also distorted some of the elements of the landscape, such as the church spire and the mountains, to create a more expressive and symbolic composition.",

              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",

              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",

              "In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, \"This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big\".",
              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",
              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",
              "[1] Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse (F1541r) was also a study for the painting.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",
              "When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch in order to save money on postage, The Starry Night was one of the paintings he did not send.",
              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",
              ".",
              ".",
              ".",
              "But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall.",
              ".",
              ".",
              "And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big\u2014another failure\u2014and I have had my fill of that.\"",
              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",
              "These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.",
              "[63] Harvard astronomer Charles A.",
              "Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of The Starry Night contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.",
              "C.",
              "L.",
              "A.)",
              ".",
              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",
              "[15] He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.",
              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",
              "[67] Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.",
              "[22] The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,[1][68] or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",
              "Theo's widow Jo became the caretaker of Van Gogh's legacy.",
              "In Paris in 1900 she sold the painting to poet Julien Leclercq.",

              "In this post, I will be taking a closer look at \u201cThe Starry Night\u201d by Vincent van Gogh, which he painted in 1889.",
              "With swirling lines and dramatic colors, this dreamy depiction is one of van Gogh\u2019s most iconic works.",
              "\u201cI don\u2019t know anything with certainty, but seeing the stars makes me dream.",
              "\u201d Vincent van Gogh When I think of \u201cThe Starry Night\u201d, the first thing which comes to mind is the swirling brushwork which creates a sense of movement and turbulence, especially in the sky.",
              "In fact, a physicist by the name of Jose Luis Aragon suggested that the swirling brushwork in paintings like \u201cThe Starry Night\u201d have an uncanny resemblance to the mathematical expression of real turbulence shown in natural occurrences like whirlpools and air streams. You can read more on this here.",
              "Van Gogh used a loaded brush to build up a thick, impasto texture which you can see in the close-ups below.",
              "This impasto texture is a key feature in many of van Gogh\u2019s works.",
              "In a letter to his brother Theo, van Gogh wrote that the \u201cstarry night is more alive and more richly colored than the day\u201d.",
              "This may explain his exaggerated use of of color.",
              "Van Gogh used rich blues and yellows to paint the night sky, with light greens scattered throughout.",
              "His lack of blending creates a broken color effect, which seems to reiterate the sense of movement and turbulence in the painting.",
              "The colors appear to vibrate as your eyes bounce between all the distinct colors.",
              "He painted the light of the stars, moon and houses by contrasting vivid yellows and oranges against the blues and greens in the rest of the painting.",
              "If you look closely, you will see that in most cases he used a saturated yellow or orange in the centre, then used lighter but less saturated colors around the outside.",
              "He used a light green almost as an interim color to transition from the bright yellows and oranges to the deep blues.",
              "Green being what you get when you mix yellow and blue together.",
              "By doing that, there appears to be some kind of color gradation even though he did not use any blending.",
              "To me, this painting marks an interesting area somewhere between realism and complete abstraction.",
              "Van Gogh pushed the colors and style in order to depict his unique interpretation of the world, but not so much as to lose all qualities of realism and representation.",
              "You know exactly what the subject is, but it is far from what you would see in life.",
              "I enjoy this area in painting as I think it allows for some personal expression, without departing too far from representational art standards.",
              "But of course, this is all just personal commentary which does not really matter.",
              "There is no right answer with this kind of stuff.",
              "Some admire van Gogh for his unique interpretations, whilst others criticise him for stepping too far away from the boundaries of reality.",

              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",

              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",

              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",
              "[59] He criticizes Schapiro's and Loevgren's biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun.",
              "He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"",
              "[60] It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of The Starry Night that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting.",
              "As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.",
              "[17] He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.",
              "[22] He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.",
              "[61] And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.",
              "Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters,[62] he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes.",
              "Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in The Starry Night to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.",
              "[22] He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky.",

              "[64] While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,[65] he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.",

              "[66] Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.",
              "[18] (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting The Starry Night.)",

              "[3][22] In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.",
              "Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in The Starry Night is the subject of an open debate.",
              "In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"[69] though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\"",
              "One week after painting The Starry Night, he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts.",
              "I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"",
              "[70] In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"",
              "[71] These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.",
              "Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"",
              "[44] Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"",
              "[62] Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"",
              "[72] (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.)",
              "Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" The Starry Night \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"",
              "[73] Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.",
              "[1] Boime asserts that the cypresses were visible in the east,[17] as does Jirat-Wasiutyn\u0301ski.",
              "[74] Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,[21] and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star.",
              "Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.",
              "Soth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that The Starry Night is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"",
              "[75] However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\"",
              "Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was The Starry Night, when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\"",
              "The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects.",
              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",
              "As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"",
              "[76] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.)",
              "And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished.",
              "Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something\u2014must one say the word\u2014something artificial\u2014something affected.\"",
              "[77][78] While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss The Starry Night in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.",
              "[79] \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a mental epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"",
              "[80] Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"",
              "[31] Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.",
              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
              "[31] After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent The Starry Night to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.",
              "[25][73] Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891.",
              "Theo's widow Jo became the caretaker of Van Gogh's legacy.",

              "In 1901 Leclercq sold it to Gauguin's old friend E\u0301mile Schuffenecker.",
              "Jo bought the painting back from Schuffenecker and in 1906 sold it to the Oldenzeel Gallery in Rotterdam.",

              "and his resume juxtaposed natural, scientific, philosophical and personal elements.",

              "4) Physicist Jose Luis Aragon compared the turbulent play of light and dark in such works as \"Starry Night\" to the mathematical expression of turbulence in such natural occurrences as as whirlpools and air streams. He found they matched very closely.",
              "Two other Van Gogh paintings from 1890, WheatField with Crows and Road with Cypress and Star also feature this mathematical parallel.",

              "This positive interpretation of the cypress symbolism hearkens back to a letter to his brother in which the artist likened death to a train that travels to the stars.",
              "6) In his 2015 book, \"Cosmographics,\" Michael Benson contends that the inspiration behind the distinctive swirls in the sky of Van Gogh's \"Starry Night\" is an 1845 drawing by astronomer William Parsons, Earl of Rosse, of the Whirlpool Galaxy.",
              "7) Research has confirmed that the dominant morning star in the painting is actually Venus, which was in a similar position at the time Van Gogh was working on \"Starry Night,\" and it would have shone brightly, just as Van Gogh painted it.",

              "As an artist who preferred working from observation, van Gogh was limited to the subjects that surrounded him\u2014his own likeness, views outside his studio window, and the surrounding countryside that he could visit with a chaperone.",
              "Although van Gogh\u2019s subjects were restricted, his style was not.",
              "He experimented with the depiction of various weather conditions and changing light, often painting the wheat fields nearby under a bright summer sun or dark storm clouds.",
              "Van Gogh was also particularly preoccupied by the challenges of painting a night landscape and wrote about it not only to his brother, Theo, but to a fellow painter, E\u0301mile Bernard, and to his sister, Willemien.",
              "In a letter addressed to the latter, he alleged that night was more colourful than day and that stars were more than simple white dots on black, instead appearing yellow, pink, or green.",
              "By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Re\u0301my, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rho\u0302ne) (1888).",
              "In that work, stars appear in bursts of yellow against a blue-black sky and compete with both the glowing gas lamps below and their reflection in the Rho\u0302ne River.",
              "At the asylum, van Gogh observed the night sky from his barred bedroom window and wrote a letter to Theo describing a magnificent view of the morning star very early one morning in the summer of 1889.",
              "Because he was not allowed to paint in his bedroom, he painted the scene from memory or possibly drawings and used his imagination for the small village that did not actually exist.",
              "Employing the expressive style he had developed during his stay in Paris in 1886\u201388, he applied the paint directly from the tube onto the canvas, creating thick impasto and intense hues.",
              "Ambivalent about working from his imagination, van Gogh eventually regarded the finished Starry Night as a failure, and Theo frankly indicated that the painting favoured style over substance.",
              "The painting was one of van Gogh\u2019s late works, as he committed suicide the following year.",
              "His artistic career was brief, comprising only 10 years, but it was very productive.",
              "He left more than 800 paintings and 700 to 850 drawings to his brother.",
              "When the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City purchased The Starry Night from a private collector in 1941, it was not well known, but it has since become one of van Gogh\u2019s most famous, if not one of the most recognized, works in the art history canon."

              "[L 5] Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the \"morning star\") was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible.",
              "So the brightest \"star\" in the painting, just to the viewer's right of the cypress tree, is actually Venus.",
              "[15][17] The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it actually was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture,[15] and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh's Moon would not have been astronomically correct.",
              "(For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.)",
              "The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,[22] which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "[3] Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provenc\u0327al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his \"reminisces of the North\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.",

              "[1] After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"",
              "[24] Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\";",
              "\"the rest\" would include The Starry Night.",

              "[25] Finally, in a letter to painter E\u0301mile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a \"failure.\"",
              "[26] Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred,[27] or paint what Gauguin called \"abstractions\":[28] paintings conceived in the imagination, or de te\u0302te.",
              "[29] In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him for nine weeks in the autumn and winter[clarification needed] of 1888: \"When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know.",

              "[30] Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of The Starry Night.",
              "[31] Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: \"I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [The Starry Night] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.\"",
              "[26] Vincent responded in early November, \"Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing.",
              "If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it.",
              "But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\"",
              "And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"",
              "[32] But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them[33] and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.",
              "[34] Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series.",
              "He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Re\u0301my.",
              "The Starry Night belongs to this latter series,[35] as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.",
              "The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.",
              "e., at night.",
              "[36] The first painting in the series was Cafe\u0301 Terrace at Night, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by Starry Night (Over the Rho\u0302ne) later that same month.",
              "Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and The Starry Night in particular.",
              "Soon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat;",
              "there are some really beautiful nights here.\"",
              "That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"",
              "[37] He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"",
              "[38] Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,[39][40] he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife.",
              "He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted Starry Night Over the Rho\u0302ne, confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"",
              "[41] He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky.",
              "\"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"",
              "[42] \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"",
              "[37] And he stated flatly that The Starry Night was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"",
              "[43] Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of The Starry Night, saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"",
              "[44] Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"[44] of the work makes reference to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"",
              "[45] (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in Landscape with Olive Trees,[46] painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to The Starry Night.)",
              "[47] Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling The Starry Night a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"",
              "[48] He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.",
              "[49] Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of Walt Whitman.",
              "[50] He calls The Starry Night \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"",
              "[51] Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision[52] and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis.",
              "[53] Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of The Starry Night \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"",
              "[54] Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in The Starry Night, saying that the painting is a \"traditional religious subject in disguise\"[57] and a \"sublimated image of [Van Gogh's] deepest religious feelings.\"",
              "[58] Citing Van Gogh's avowed admiration for the paintings of Euge\u0300ne Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter's use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in The Starry Night.",

              "What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in The Starry Night.",
              "On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term.",
              "In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens.",

              "[67] Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted The Starry Night, that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"",
              "[81] On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,[82] Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"",
