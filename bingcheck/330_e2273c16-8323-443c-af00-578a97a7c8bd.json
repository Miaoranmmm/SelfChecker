    "query": "What is the origin and cultural significance behind the traditional African instrument known as the kora, and how has it evolved over time to become a symbol of West African music and identity?",
    "response": "The kora is a **West African harp** with **21 strings** and a large **calabash gourd** body[^1^] [^2^]. According to Eric Charry, a historian of West African music, the instrument originated in the late 18th century, during the era of the **Gabu empire**, which encompassed present-day Guinea Bissau, southern Senegal and the Gambia[^1^]. The kora is traditionally associated with **royalty**, the **ruling classes**, or **religious practices**[^2^] and is used by male musicians mainly to accompany **narrations**, **recitations**, and **songs** in honour of a patron[^2^]. The kora is also one of the instruments used within **Jali families** of the Mande people in West Africa, who are traditional **historians**, **genealogists** and **storytellers** who pass their skills on to their descendants[^3^] [^5^].\n\nThe kora has evolved over time to become a symbol of West African music and identity, as it has been adapted to various musical genres and styles, such as jazz, blues, pop, classical, and world music. Some of the most famous kora players in the world include Toumani Diabat\u00e9, Jaliba Kuyateh, Ballak\u00e9 Sissoko, Sona Jobarteh, Foday Musa Suso, Seckou Keita, Toubab Krewe, Jacques Burtin, Alhaji Bai Konte and sons Dembo and Sherrifo, Mory Kante, Sidiki Jobarteh, Alahji Malamini Jobarteh father of Tatadinding, Pabobo Dembo, Landing Jobarteh, Lalo keba Drameh Jobarteh, Moussa Kouyate[^3^]. The kora has also been featured in many films, documentaries, and festivals that showcase the rich and diverse culture of West Africa[^6^].",

              "The kora (Manding languages: \u07de\u07d0\u07d9\u07ca k\u0254ra[1]) is a stringed instrument used extensively in West Africa.",
              "[2] A kora typically has 21 strings, which are played by plucking with the fingers.",
              "It combines features of the lute and harp.",
              "The kora is built from gourd, cut in half and covered with cow skin to make a resonator with a long hardwood neck.",
              "The skin is supported by two handles that run underneath it.",
              "It has 21 strings, each of which plays a different note.",
              "These strings are supported by a notched, double free-standing bridge.",
              "[3] The kora doesn't fit into any one category of musical instrument, but rather several, and must be classified as a \"double-bridge-harp-lute.\"",
              "The strings run in two divided ranks, characteristic of a double harp.",
              "They do not end in a soundboard but are instead held in notches on a bridge, classifying it as a bridge harp.",
              "The strings originate from a string arm or neck and cross a bridge directly supported by a resonating chamber, also making it a lute.",
              "The sound of a kora resembles that of a harp, though when played in the traditional style it bears resemblance to a guitar played using the flamenco or Delta blues technique of plucking polyrhythmic patterns with both hands (using the remaining fingers to secure the instrument by holding the hand posts on either side of the strings).",
              "Ostinato riffs (\"kumbengo\") and improvised solo runs (\"birimintingo\") are played at the same time by skilled players.",
              "Kora players have traditionally come from jali families (also from the Mandinka tribes) who are traditional historians, genealogists and storytellers who pass their skills on to their descendants.",
              "Though played in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Senegal, the instrument was first discovered in the Gambia.",
              "While those from neighbouring Guinea were known to carry the lute, Senegalese Griots were known as carriers of a hand drum known as the 'sabar'.",
              "Most West African musicians prefer the term \"jali\" to \"griot,\" which is the French word.",
              "\"Jali\" means something similar to a \"bard\" or oral historian.",
              "Traditional koras feature strings, eleven played by the left hand and ten by the right.",
              "Modern koras made in the Casamance region of southern Senegal sometimes feature additional bass strings, adding up to four strings to the traditional 21.",
              "[4] Strings were traditionally made from thin strips of hide, such as cow or antelope skin.",
              "Today, most strings are made from harp strings or nylon fishing line,[5] sometimes plaited together to create thicker strings.",
              "A vital accessory in the past was the nyenmyemo, a leaf-shaped plate of tin or brass with wire loops threaded around the edge.",
              "Clamped to the bridge,[6][dubious \u2013 discuss] or the top end of the neck[7] it produced sympathetic sounds, serving as an amplifier since the sound carried well into the open air.",
              "In today's environment, players usually prefer or need an electronic pickup.",
              "[6] By moving the konso (a system of leather tuning rings) up and down the neck, a kora player can retune the instrument into one of four seven-note scales.",
              "These scales are close in tuning to western major, minor and Lydian modes.",
              "[8][9] In the 1300s, the traveller Ibn Battuta mentioned that the women who accompanied Dugha to perform were carrying bows that they plucked.",
              "He did not mention the number of strings, but this clearly shows the existence of harp instruments in 14th century Mali and could be the earliest written reference to the kora.",
              "The kora is designed like a bow with a gourd, similarly to Ibn Battuta's description, but Battuta did not go into enough detail about the instruments for them to be identifiable.",
              "The earliest European reference to the kora in Western literature is in Travels in Interior Districts of Africa (1799) by the Scotsman Mungo Park.",
              "The most likely scenario, based on Mandinka oral tradition, suggests that the origins of the kora may ultimately be linked with Jali Mady Fouling Cissoko, some time after the founding of Kaabu in the 16th century.",
              "[citation needed] The kora is mentioned in the Senegalese national anthem \"Pincez Tous vos Koras, Frappez les Balafons.\"",
              "Nowadays, koras are increasingly made with guitar machine heads instead of the traditional konso (leather rings).",
              "The advantage is that they are much easier to tune.",
              "The disadvantage is that this design limits the tuning range of the instrument because string lengths are more fixed and lighter strings are needed to lift it much more than a tone.",
              "Learning to tune a traditional kora is arguably as difficult as learning to play it, and many tourists who are entranced by the sound while in West Africa buy koras and then find themselves unable to keep it in tune once they are home, relegating it to the status of ornament.",
              "[citation needed] Koras can be converted to replace the leather rings with machine heads.",
              "Wooden pegs and harp pegs are also used, but both can still cause tuning problems in damper climates unless made with great skill.",
              "In the late 20th century, a 25-string model of the kora was developed, though it has been adopted by only a few players, primarily in the region of Casamance, in southern Senegal.",
              "Some kora players such as Seckou Keita have double necked koras, allowing them to switch from one tuning to another within seconds, giving them increased flexibility.",
              "The French Benedictine monks of the Keur Moussa Abbey in Senegal (who possibly were the first to introduce guitar machine heads instead of leather rings in the late seventies) conceived a method based on scores to teach the instrument.",
              "Brother Dominique Catta, choirmaster of the Keur Moussa Abbey,[10] was the first Western composer who wrote for the kora (solo pieces as well as duets with Western instruments).",
              "[11] An electric instrument modeled on the kora (but made primarily of metal) called the gravikord was invented in the late 20th century by instrument builder and musician Robert Grawi.",
              "It has 24 strings and is tuned and played differently than the kora.",
              "Another instrument, the gravi-kora, a 21-stringed electro-acoustic instrument, was later developed by Robert Grawi especially for kora players who wanted a modern instrument.",
              "Its playing and tuning are the same as the traditional kora.",
              "[12] The gravi-kora has been adopted by kora players such as Daniel Berkman,[13] Jacques Burtin,[14] and Foday Musa Suso, who featured it in recordings with jazz innovator Herbie Hancock,[15] with his band Mandingo, and on Suso's New World Power album.",

              "Although this instrument has virtually disappeared today, recordings of it from the early 1950s are available thanks to the fieldwork performed by French ethnomusicologist Gilbert Rouget in Guinea in the 1950s.",
              "On these recordings, one can clearly hear the contrapuntal or interlocking playing style engendered in kora technique, although the tuning is radically different than that performed on kora today.",
              "Besides evidence in the oral tradition, the instrument\u2019s size, its number of strings, its relatively complicated construction and its intricate playing style, the reason why the kora is thought of by ethnomusicologists as a much younger instrument compared to others in the region is also due to its relatively limited influence.",
              "In addition to the above harps, lutes (such as the ngoni;",
              "see, for example, accession ## 89.",
              "4.",
              "473 and 89.",
              "4.",

              "4.",
              "492)) can be seen across West Africa in different forms, whereas there is little that resembles the kora outside of the Mande\u0301 region.",
              "The instrument\u2019s lowest note\u2013sometimes referred to as the mara timbango or timbamba\u2013is found at the far left corner of the bridge, which is to say closest to the player when the instrument is pointed in a playing position towards them.",
              "The next three ascending notes\u2013typically jumping an interval of a fifth, followed by two approximate whole steps\u2013are also found lined up after the timbango progressively on the left hand side.",
              "The next note in the scale, typically a half step up, reaching an octave from the mara timbango, is on the far right corner of the bridge.",
              "This note is often referred to simply as the timbango.",
              "Each note then ascends on the opposite side of the bridge for the next two octaves, which is to say that the notes following the timbango in the scale are the fifth string on the left hand side, followed by the second on the right, the sixth on the left, the third on the right, and so on.",
              "At the top of those two octaves is the eighth string on the right side, which is followed on the right side with the two highest notes on the instrument, a whole step between each.",
              "Much of the kora\u2019s repertoire is drawn from an older instrument called the bala, a wooden xylophone.",
              "In the case of the bala, the right hand voices the bass and tenor notes, while the left hand voices the alto and soprano notes on the instrument.",
              "On a kora, the role of the right hand on bala maps onto the thumbs while the role of the left hand on bala maps onto the indexes.",
              "A kora piece often begins with the indexes spelling out the melodic introduction, followed by the thumbs\u2019 articulation of the kumbengo: a rhythmic pattern, similar to a vamp, that characterizes Mande\u0301 instrumental performance.",
              "At the same time as the thumbs play the kumbengo, the indexes perform a series of melodic and rhythmic lines.",
              "While the thumbs and indexes work, respectively, to articulate musical lines step-wise in the scale, the thumb and index fingers on opposite hands work together to voice octaves, while the thumb and index on the same hand will be used to create chords, since most of the intervals between strings on one side of the bridge are thirds.",
              "If this coordination wasn\u2019t intricate enough, some kora players, particularly inheritors of the tradition in the Western parts of the Mande\u0301 region, will also flick the knuckle or nail of their index fingers on the instrument\u2019s handles as a percussive element.",
              "The kora has undergone a number of changes since this particular instrument was built in the nineteenth century.",
              "Materially, the julo\u0301, or strings, on contemporary koras tend to be made from nylon, instead of the traditional animal gut, and are tuned with tuning pegs or guitar machine heads, in lieu of the konso, or braided leather loops.",
              "Musically, the instrument's four principle modes\u2013hardino, tomoraba (or silaba), sauta, and tomora mesengo\u2013have modulated both upwards and to the closest Western diatonic scales on recordings and in performances of kora in recent decades.",
              "The upward modulation, in particular, has been attributed to the ripple effects of the emphasis placed on singers\u2019 virtuosity in performances local to the Mande\u0301 region;",
              "singing higher is frequently associated with a more virtuosic technique, so instruments have modulated upwards in order to meet the demands of singers they accompany, who sing progressively higher over time.",

              "A complete recitation of the Sunjata story can take between six and eight hours.",
              "The telling of the story is therefore a remarkable feat in and of itself\u2014all the more so because its words are maintained entirely in the memories of the storytellers.",
              "The epic is the property of the jali caste, members of which are responsible for passing it from generation to generation.",
              "Founded in 1240, the Mali Empire occupied all or part of half a dozen modern West African countries.",
              "It flourished until 1645, when conflict over accession to the throne resulted in the collapse of the empire.",
              "Although the Mali Empire was large and powerful, its history has largely been told from outside perspectives.",
              "This is because its inhabitants did not cultivate written language, instead maintaining knowledge by means of oral transmission\u2014a process that carries into the present day.",
              "The Mandinka, who currently number about 32 million, are the descendents of the Mali Empire, and they continue to celebrate their common heritage through story and song.",
              "Before we can examine Mandinkan storytelling practices, we need to know something about the people who tell those stories.",
              "Traditionally, Mandinkan society was organized according to a caste system, meaning that social roles were determined by birth and were strictly defined.",
              "Members of the jali caste were musicians and storytellers, and their role was to serve the aristocratic caste.",
              "(You might be familiar with the French term \u201cgriot,\u201d which is more widely used in the West, but members of the community generally prefer the term \u201cjali.",
              "\u201d) Although the caste system is officially defunct today, it still exerts an influence on modern society, and jali continue to pass their knowledge and skills down through family lines.",
              "The jali caste was not high ranking, but its members were considered to have special powers and to occupy a unique place in the community.",
              "They were considered ritually impure, and were prohibited from wearing the clothes of the aristocracy or sitting on their beds.",
              "When they died, they were buried separately from other members of the community.",
              "Jali also could not hold political office.",
              "At the same time, jali served as advisors to aristocrats and could therefore be very powerful.",
              "If a jali was captured in battle, they could not be killed or enslaved, but were expected to serve their captor as they had served their previous master.",
              "The responsibilities of the jali were many.",
              "They were musicians, and as such they provided ceremonial music for naming ceremonies, marriages, and agricul- tural celebrations.",
              "They also entertained at dances and wrestling matches and sang the praises of the aristocrats they served.",
              "However, the primary role of the jali was to maintain and transmit the knowledge and traditions of the commu- nity, including histories, genealogies, proverbs, and laws.",
              "If the jali did not fulfill their function, therefore, society itself would disintegrate.",
              "Apart from these weighty tasks, the jali also served as moralists, counsellors, spokesmen, public announcers, mediators, mes- sengers, buffoons, porters, tax collectors, and hairdressers.",
              "The jali enjoyed dominion over specific musical instruments.",
              "These included the ngoni (a small lute made from wood and covered with goat skin), the balafon (a xylophone in which wood keys are strung over gourd resonators), and the kora.",
              "The last of these is certainly the most remarkable, and has retained the deepest connection with the jali tradition.",
              "The kora is a type of harp lute, the strings of which are suspended above a large resonator made out of a calabash gourd covered with cow skin.",
              "The strings are plucked with the thumb and index finger of each hand.",
              "All three of these instruments are used to play complex melodic patterns constructed out of complementary interlocking parts\u2014 parts that, at least on the balafon and kora, are each played with one of the two hands.",
              "Traditionally, these instruments were only played by men.",
              "Boys would begin to learn from their fathers or uncles, and a jali\u2019s musical education would culminate in the building of his own instrument.",
              "A jali also needed to master the tuning systems, which are different for each instrument and quite unlike anything found in Europe.",
              "A result of this is that West African music can sound out of tune, although in fact each pitch is carefully positioned.",
              "Female jali were musicians too, but they were only trained to sing and play a percussion instrument called the neo.",
              "Today, of course, many women excel as performers on all of these instruments.",
              "The Sunjata story is well known, for it has been frequently published in both novel and verse form over the past century and is often included in world literature courses.",
              "It constitutes a mythologized retelling of how the historical figure Sunjanta unified the Mali Empire and became its first ruler.",
              "According to the epic, Sunjata\u2014 whose glorious conquests had been foretold by a soothsayer\u2014was the son of the Mandinkan king\u2019s second wife.",
              "As a child, however, Sunjata could not walk, and when the king died it was his half brother who ascended to the throne.",
              "Sunjata and his mother were exiled and found a new home in the Mema kingdom, where Sunjata grew strong and gained such widespread support that he was designated heir to the throne.",
              "When the Mandinka kingdom was attacked by a malicious power, Sunjata came to the rescue while his half-brother fled in fear.",
              "Sunjata\u2019s coalition of small kingdoms defeated the aggressor and resulted in the founding of the Mali Empire.",
              "There are not many recordings of the Sunjata story in existence, for it is carefully guarded.",
              "The epic is often related as part of religious ceremonies, and it is believed to bring blessings to all who hear it.",
              "Listeners, however, are prohibited from recording these performances.",
              "The recordings that are available have been made at formal concerts or recording sessions, and therefore lack many of the elements that would characterize a more authentic performance.",
              "These recordings tend to be brief, both because they often omit episodes from the story and because they lack the participatory embellishments that bring the story to life when it is shared in a communal context.",
              "Listeners, for example, might join together in singing hymns at appropriate points, or jali might shout out praise songs dedicated to historical figures as they enter the narrative.",
              "Participants will also interrupt the story to donate money in return for blessings.",
              "In considering our recordings, therefore, we must be aware that they offer only a glimpse of Sunjata epic recitation as a living practice.",
              "Apart from being brief, they are in no way definitive.",
              "There are variations in the words that are used to tell the story and even in the events that are related (sometimes, for example, Sunjata and his mother are exiled from the Mali kingdom, while other times they choose to leave for their own safety).",
              "The epic is also not always sung to the same melody, nor is the accompaniment stable.",
              "The underlying instrumental music might be supplied by kora, balafon, ngoni, or even guitar, and the pattern played by these instruments\u2014known as the kumbengo\u2014can vary in large and small ways.",
              "We will begin with a recording made of a 1987 performance in which jali Djelimady Sissoko recites the epic while Sidiki Diabate\u0301 accompanies him on the kora.",
              "Like all performances, this begins with an instrumental improvisation.",
              "At first there is no pulse, but gradually the player settles in to the kumbengo.",
              "In this case, we hear the most typical kumbengo for a Sunjata epic recitation, that associated with the Sunjata praise song.",
              "The praise song is entirely separate from the epic, but it might be sung during a ritual performance of the epic and the two are closely connected.",
              "The Sunjata Story 12.",
              "Performance: Djelimady Sissoko, accompanied by Sidiki Diabate\u0301 (1987) 13.",
              "The Sunjata praise song is musically related to the recitation of the epic.",
              "The singer enters at the top of his range and then descends down the scale outlined in the accompaniment.",
              "This is the typical melodic shape for epic recitation, and it is influenced by the Mandinka language, which is tonal.",
              "This means that the inflection of vowel sounds changes the meaning of a word.",
              "Because most Mandinka words inflect in a downward direction, setting the words to music naturally produces a descending melody.",
              "The vocal ability of a singer is judged in terms of power and confidence.",
              "However, the most important quality for a singer to possess is truthfulness.",
              "A good singer, therefore, is one whose words are true, regardless of the sound of their voice.",
              "The truthfulness of Djelimady Sissoko\u2019s words is confirmed by Sidiki Diabate\u0301, who fulfills the role of witness by chanting naamu, or \u201cindeed,\u201d at the end of every sentence.",
              "(If the jali makes a mistake in telling the story, which frequently occurs, the witness must correct it.)",
              "The \u201cgroove\u201d is an important characteristic of this performance, as is the rhythmic interaction between the singer and kora player.",
              "However, these elements are not simple to perceive or explain.",
              "While the repetitiveness of the accompaniment makes it obvious that there is a regular pulse, that pulse is constantly shifting.",
              "Try tapping your foot along to the music, and you will soon find that you have lost the beat.",
              "This is the result of a concept of rhythm that is based on patterns, not European-style meter.",
              "West African musicians, for example, do not count beats in the way European musicians do, and they do not recognize a downbeat (the first and strongest pulse in a metrical grouping).",
              "Instead, they transform rhythmic patterns in the way that a kaleidoscope transforms images.",
              "This concept of constant transformation is central to the practice of West African instrumentalists.",
              "In this recording, the kora player never repeats the kumbengo pattern unchanged for long.",
              "Instead, he makes constant alterations to the rhythmic and pitch content, adding syncopations and ornaments of unending variety.",
              "He also interjects virtuosic flourishes in between the phrases of the story.",
              "Periodically, the singer pauses to allow for an extended kora solo.",
              "14 While the basic musical contents of the kumbengo are quite simple, therefore, the work of the kora player is complex and sophisticated.",
              "We will briefly examine a second performance of episodes from the Sunjata story for the sake of comparison.",
              "15 This rendition, recorded in 2014, is accompanied by the balafon.",
              "Although the balafon, which is a percussion instrument, is quite different from the kora in terms of construction, playing technique, and sound, it executes exactly the same function.",
              "Again, the performance opens with an extended solo by the balafon player, Fode\u0301 Lassana Diabate\u0301, who eventually settles into a kumbengo that is very similar to that played on the kora.",
              "Again, the balafon player constantly alters his accompaniment, adding rhythmic and melodic variations.",
              "And again, he occasionally takes the opportunity to improvise extended instrumental solos in between sections of the recited text.",
              "This is one of many kora solos that interrupt the jali\u2019s recitation.",
              "The Sunjata Story.",
              "Performance: Hawa Kasse\u0301 Mady Diabate\u0301, accompanied by Fode\u0301 Lassana Diabate\u0301 (2014) The work of the singer, Hawa Kasse\u0301 Mady Diabate\u0301, can also be compared to the previous recording.",
              "Most of her phrases begin high in her range and descend down the scale.",
              "She regularly enters during different parts of the kumbengo and does not align her phrases with the accompaniment.",
              "And her vocal production is powerful and commanding.",
              "She periodically plays a simple percussion instrument, known as a shekere, that consists of a gourd with a beaded cover.",
              "Although this rendition is excellent, its context\u2014amplified on a stage before a silent audience\u2014is far removed from that in which the Sunjata story has thrived for eight hundred years.",

              "[2] A kora typically has 21 strings, which are played by plucking with the fingers.",
              "It combines features of the lute and harp.",
              "The kora is built from gourd, cut in half and covered with cow skin to make a resonator with a long hardwood neck.",
              "The skin is supported by two handles that run underneath it.",
              "It has 21 strings, each of which plays a different note.",
              "These strings are supported by a notched, double free-standing bridge.",
              "[3] The kora doesn't fit into any one category of musical instrument, but rather several, and must be classified as a \"double-bridge-harp-lute.\"",
              "The strings run in two divided ranks, characteristic of a double harp.",
              "They do not end in a soundboard but are instead held in notches on a bridge, classifying it as a bridge harp.",
              "The strings originate from a string arm or neck and cross a bridge directly supported by a resonating chamber, also making it a lute.",
              "The sound of a kora resembles that of a harp, though when played in the traditional style it bears resemblance to a guitar played using the flamenco or Delta blues technique of plucking polyrhythmic patterns with both hands (using the remaining fingers to secure the instrument by holding the hand posts on either side of the strings).",
              "Ostinato riffs (\"kumbengo\") and improvised solo runs (\"birimintingo\") are played at the same time by skilled players.",
              "Kora players have traditionally come from jali families (also from the Mandinka tribes) who are traditional historians, genealogists and storytellers who pass their skills on to their descendants.",
              "Though played in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Senegal, the instrument was first discovered in the Gambia.",
              "While those from neighbouring Guinea were known to carry the lute, Senegalese Griots were known as carriers of a hand drum known as the 'sabar'.",
              "Most West African musicians prefer the term \"jali\" to \"griot,\" which is the French word.",
              "\"Jali\" means something similar to a \"bard\" or oral historian.",
              "Traditional koras feature strings, eleven played by the left hand and ten by the right.",
              "Modern koras made in the Casamance region of southern Senegal sometimes feature additional bass strings, adding up to four strings to the traditional 21.",
              "[4] Strings were traditionally made from thin strips of hide, such as cow or antelope skin.",
              "Today, most strings are made from harp strings or nylon fishing line,[5] sometimes plaited together to create thicker strings.",
              "A vital accessory in the past was the nyenmyemo, a leaf-shaped plate of tin or brass with wire loops threaded around the edge.",
              "Clamped to the bridge,[6][dubious \u2013 discuss] or the top end of the neck[7] it produced sympathetic sounds, serving as an amplifier since the sound carried well into the open air.",
              "In today's environment, players usually prefer or need an electronic pickup.",
              "[6] By moving the konso (a system of leather tuning rings) up and down the neck, a kora player can retune the instrument into one of four seven-note scales.",
              "These scales are close in tuning to western major, minor and Lydian modes.",
              "[8][9] In the 1300s, the traveller Ibn Battuta mentioned that the women who accompanied Dugha to perform were carrying bows that they plucked.",
              "He did not mention the number of strings, but this clearly shows the existence of harp instruments in 14th century Mali and could be the earliest written reference to the kora.",
              "The kora is designed like a bow with a gourd, similarly to Ibn Battuta's description, but Battuta did not go into enough detail about the instruments for them to be identifiable.",
              "The earliest European reference to the kora in Western literature is in Travels in Interior Districts of Africa (1799) by the Scotsman Mungo Park.",
              "The most likely scenario, based on Mandinka oral tradition, suggests that the origins of the kora may ultimately be linked with Jali Mady Fouling Cissoko, some time after the founding of Kaabu in the 16th century.",
              "[citation needed] The kora is mentioned in the Senegalese national anthem \"Pincez Tous vos Koras, Frappez les Balafons.\"",
              "Nowadays, koras are increasingly made with guitar machine heads instead of the traditional konso (leather rings).",
              "The advantage is that they are much easier to tune.",
              "The disadvantage is that this design limits the tuning range of the instrument because string lengths are more fixed and lighter strings are needed to lift it much more than a tone.",
              "Learning to tune a traditional kora is arguably as difficult as learning to play it, and many tourists who are entranced by the sound while in West Africa buy koras and then find themselves unable to keep it in tune once they are home, relegating it to the status of ornament.",
              "[citation needed] Koras can be converted to replace the leather rings with machine heads.",
              "Wooden pegs and harp pegs are also used, but both can still cause tuning problems in damper climates unless made with great skill.",
              "In the late 20th century, a 25-string model of the kora was developed, though it has been adopted by only a few players, primarily in the region of Casamance, in southern Senegal.",
              "Some kora players such as Seckou Keita have double necked koras, allowing them to switch from one tuning to another within seconds, giving them increased flexibility.",
              "The French Benedictine monks of the Keur Moussa Abbey in Senegal (who possibly were the first to introduce guitar machine heads instead of leather rings in the late seventies) conceived a method based on scores to teach the instrument.",
              "Brother Dominique Catta, choirmaster of the Keur Moussa Abbey,[10] was the first Western composer who wrote for the kora (solo pieces as well as duets with Western instruments).",
              "[11] An electric instrument modeled on the kora (but made primarily of metal) called the gravikord was invented in the late 20th century by instrument builder and musician Robert Grawi.",
              "It has 24 strings and is tuned and played differently than the kora.",
              "Another instrument, the gravi-kora, a 21-stringed electro-acoustic instrument, was later developed by Robert Grawi especially for kora players who wanted a modern instrument.",
              "Its playing and tuning are the same as the traditional kora.",
              "[12] The gravi-kora has been adopted by kora players such as Daniel Berkman,[13] Jacques Burtin,[14] and Foday Musa Suso, who featured it in recordings with jazz innovator Herbie Hancock,[15] with his band Mandingo, and on Suso's New World Power album.",

              "For example, in the Mali Empire of West Africa (which lasted from 1226 to 1670), the griots were highly respected and it was tradition for royal family members to give each other griots who acted as royal advisors.",

              "Ancient tradition singled the griots out as a separate people with their own caste.",

              "[2] A kora typically has 21 strings, which are played by plucking with the fingers.",
              "It combines features of the lute and harp.",
              "The kora is built from gourd, cut in half and covered with cow skin to make a resonator with a long hardwood neck.",
              "The skin is supported by two handles that run underneath it.",
              "It has 21 strings, each of which plays a different note.",
              "These strings are supported by a notched, double free-standing bridge.",
              "[3] The kora doesn't fit into any one category of musical instrument, but rather several, and must be classified as a \"double-bridge-harp-lute.\"",
              "The strings run in two divided ranks, characteristic of a double harp.",
              "They do not end in a soundboard but are instead held in notches on a bridge, classifying it as a bridge harp.",
              "The strings originate from a string arm or neck and cross a bridge directly supported by a resonating chamber, also making it a lute.",
              "The sound of a kora resembles that of a harp, though when played in the traditional style it bears resemblance to a guitar played using the flamenco or Delta blues technique of plucking polyrhythmic patterns with both hands (using the remaining fingers to secure the instrument by holding the hand posts on either side of the strings).",
              "Ostinato riffs (\"kumbengo\") and improvised solo runs (\"birimintingo\") are played at the same time by skilled players.",
              "Kora players have traditionally come from jali families (also from the Mandinka tribes) who are traditional historians, genealogists and storytellers who pass their skills on to their descendants.",
              "Though played in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Senegal, the instrument was first discovered in the Gambia.",
              "While those from neighbouring Guinea were known to carry the lute, Senegalese Griots were known as carriers of a hand drum known as the 'sabar'.",
              "Most West African musicians prefer the term \"jali\" to \"griot,\" which is the French word.",
              "\"Jali\" means something similar to a \"bard\" or oral historian.",
              "Traditional koras feature strings, eleven played by the left hand and ten by the right.",
              "Modern koras made in the Casamance region of southern Senegal sometimes feature additional bass strings, adding up to four strings to the traditional 21.",
              "[4] Strings were traditionally made from thin strips of hide, such as cow or antelope skin.",
              "Today, most strings are made from harp strings or nylon fishing line,[5] sometimes plaited together to create thicker strings.",
              "A vital accessory in the past was the nyenmyemo, a leaf-shaped plate of tin or brass with wire loops threaded around the edge.",
              "Clamped to the bridge,[6][dubious \u2013 discuss] or the top end of the neck[7] it produced sympathetic sounds, serving as an amplifier since the sound carried well into the open air.",
              "In today's environment, players usually prefer or need an electronic pickup.",
              "[6] By moving the konso (a system of leather tuning rings) up and down the neck, a kora player can retune the instrument into one of four seven-note scales.",
              "These scales are close in tuning to western major, minor and Lydian modes.",

              "The advantage is that they are much easier to tune.",

              "Learning to tune a traditional kora is arguably as difficult as learning to play it, and many tourists who are entranced by the sound while in West Africa buy koras and then find themselves unable to keep it in tune once they are home, relegating it to the status of ornament.",
