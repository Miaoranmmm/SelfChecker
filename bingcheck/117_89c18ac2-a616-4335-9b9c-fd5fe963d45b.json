    "query": "What inspired the invention of the first telephone and how has it evolved over time to become the smartphones we use today?",
    "response": "That's a great question. The invention of the first telephone is credited to **Alexander Graham Bell**, who patented his device in 1876[^1^] [^3^]. He was inspired by his interest in sound technology and his work with deaf people, including his wife and mother[^1^]. His first telephone call was to his assistant Thomas Watson, who was in another room[^1^].\n\nThe telephone evolved over time to become more portable, wireless and multifunctional. Some of the milestones in the evolution of the telephone are:\n\n- In 1900, the first wireless telephone communication was made by Reginald Fessenden using a radio transmitter and receiver[^4^].\n- In 1946, the first mobile telephone service was launched by Bell System, allowing users to make calls from their cars using a radio link[^2^].\n- In 1973, Motorola demonstrated the first handheld cellular phone, which weighed 1.1 kg and had a battery life of 20 minutes[^6^].\n- In 1983, Motorola launched the first commercial cellular phone, the DynaTAC 8000X, which cost $3,995 and had a talk time of 30 minutes[^6^].\n- In 1992, IBM introduced the first smartphone, the Simon Personal Communicator, which had a touchscreen and could send emails and faxes[^6^].\n- In 1998, Nokia released the first phone with an internet browser, the Nokia 7110[^6^].\n- In 2007, Apple launched the iPhone, which revolutionized the smartphone industry with its touchscreen interface and app store[^6^].\n- In 2010, Samsung released the Galaxy S, which popularized the Android operating system and challenged the iPhone's dominance[^6^].\n\nToday, smartphones are ubiquitous and can perform a variety of functions such as taking photos, playing games, streaming music and videos, accessing social media and more.

              "When he was just 12, the young Alexander invented a device with rotating paddles and nail brushes that could quickly remove husks from wheat grain to help improve a farming process.",
              "At age 16, Bell began studying the mechanics of speech.",
              "He went on to attend Royal High School and the University of Edinburgh.",

              "He founded the Aerial Experiment Association in 1907.",
              "The first telephone had two parts: a transmitter and a receiver.",
              "The transmitter comprised three parts\u2014a drumlike device (a cylinder with a covered end), a needle, and a battery.",
              "The covered end of the drumlike device was attached to the needle.",
              "The needle was connected by wire to the battery, and the battery was connected by wire to a receiver.",
              "When Bell spoke into the open end of the drumlike device, his voice made the paper and needle vibrate.",
              "The vibrations were then converted into an electric current which traveled along the wire to the receiver.",
              "Alexander Graham Bell, (born March 3, 1847, Edinburgh, Scotland\u2014died August 2, 1922, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada), Scottish-born American inventor, scientist, and teacher of the deaf whose foremost accomplishments were the invention of the telephone (1876) and the refinement of the phonograph (1886).",
              "Alexander (\u201cGraham\u201d was not added until he was 11) was born to Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds.",
              "His mother was almost deaf, and his father taught elocution to the deaf, influencing Alexander\u2019s later career choice as teacher of the deaf.",
              "At age 11 he entered the Royal High School at Edinburgh, but he did not enjoy the compulsory curriculum, and he left school at age 15 without graduating.",
              "In 1865 the family moved to London.",
              "Alexander passed the entrance examinations for University College London in June 1868 and matriculated there in the autumn.",
              "However, he did not complete his studies, because in 1870 the Bell family moved again, this time immigrating to Canada after the deaths of Bell\u2019s younger brother Edward in 1867 and older brother Melville in 1870, both of tuberculosis.",
              "The family settled in Brantford, Ontario, but in April 1871 Alexander moved to Boston, where he taught at the Boston School for Deaf Mutes.",
              "He also taught at the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts, and at the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut.",
              "One of Bell\u2019s students was Mabel Hubbard, daughter of Gardiner Greene Hubbard, a founder of the Clarke School.",
              "Mabel had become deaf at age five as a result of a near-fatal bout of scarlet fever.",
              "Bell began working with her in 1873, when she was 15 years old.",
              "Despite a 10-year age difference, they fell in love and were married on July 11, 1877.",
              "They had four children, Elsie (1878\u20131964), Marian (1880\u20131962), and two sons who died in infancy.",
              "While pursuing his teaching profession, Bell also began researching methods to transmit several telegraph messages simultaneously over a single wire\u2014a major focus of telegraph innovation at the time and one that ultimately led to Bell\u2019s invention of the telephone.",
              "In 1868 Joseph Stearns had invented the duplex, a system that transmitted two messages simultaneously over a single wire.",
              "Western Union Telegraph Company, the dominant firm in the industry, acquired the rights to Stearns\u2019s duplex and hired the noted inventor Thomas Edison to devise as many multiple-transmission methods as possible in order to block competitors from using them.",
              "Edison\u2019s work culminated in the quadruplex, a system for sending four simultaneous telegraph messages over a single wire.",
              "Inventors then sought methods that could send more than four;",
              "some, including Bell and his great rival Elisha Gray, developed designs capable of subdividing a telegraph line into 10 or more channels.",
              "These so-called harmonic telegraphs used reeds or tuning forks that responded to specific acoustic frequencies.",
              "They worked well in the laboratory but proved unreliable in service.",
              "A group of investors led by Gardiner Hubbard wanted to establish a federally chartered telegraph company to compete with Western Union by contracting with the Post Office to send low-cost telegrams. Hubbard saw great promise in the harmonic telegraph and backed Bell\u2019s experiments.",
              "Bell, however, was more interested in transmitting the human voice.",
              "Finally, he and Hubbard worked out an agreement that Bell would devote most of his time to the harmonic telegraph but would continue developing his telephone concept.",
              "From harmonic telegraphs transmitting musical tones, it was a short conceptual step for both Bell and Gray to transmit the human voice.",
              "Bell filed a patent describing his method of transmitting sounds on February 14, 1876, just hours before Gray filed a caveat (a statement of concept) on a similar method.",
              "On March 7, 1876, the Patent Office awarded Bell what is said to be one of the most valuable patents in history.",
              "It is most likely that both Bell and Gray independently devised their telephone designs as an outgrowth of their work on harmonic telegraphy.",
              "However, the question of priority of invention between the two has been controversial from the very beginning.",
              "Despite having the patent, Bell did not have a fully functioning instrument.",
              "He first produced intelligible speech on March 10, 1876, when he summoned his laboratory assistant, Thomas A.",
              "Watson, with words that Bell transcribed in his lab notes as \u201cMr.",
              "Watson\u2014come here\u2014I want to see you.",
              "\u201d Over the next few months, Bell continued to refine his instrument to make it suitable for public exhibition.",
              "In June he demonstrated his telephone to the judges of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, a test witnessed by Brazil\u2019s Emperor Pedro II and the celebrated Scottish physicist Sir William Thomson.",
              "In August of that year, he was on the receiving end of the first one-way long-distance call, transmitted from Brantford to nearby Paris, Ontario, over a telegraph wire.",
              "Gardiner Hubbard organized a group that established the Bell Telephone Company in July 1877 to commercialize Bell\u2019s telephone.",
              "Bell was the company\u2019s technical adviser until he lost interest in telephony in the early 1880s.",
              "Although his invention rendered him independently wealthy, he sold off most of his stock holdings in the company early and did not profit as much as he might have had he retained his shares.",
              "Thus, by the mid-1880s his role in the telephone industry was marginal.",
              "By that time, Bell had developed a growing interest in the technology of sound recording and playback.",
              "Although Edison had invented the phonograph in 1877, he soon turned his attention to other technologies, especially electric power and lighting, and his machine, which recorded and reproduced sound on a rotating cylinder wrapped in tinfoil, remained an unreliable and cumbersome device.",
              "In 1880 the French government awarded Bell the Volta Prize, given for achievement in electrical science.",
              "Bell used the prize money to set up his Volta Laboratory, an institution devoted to studying deafness and improving the lives of the deaf, in Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              "There he also devoted himself to improving the phonograph.",
              "By 1885 Bell and his colleagues (his cousin Chichester A.",
              "Bell and the inventor Charles Sumner Tainter) had a design fit for commercial use that featured a removable cardboard cylinder coated with mineral wax.",
              "They called their device the Graphophone and applied for patents, which were granted in 1886.",
              "The group formed the Volta Graphophone Company to produce their invention.",
              "Then in 1887 they sold their patents to the American Graphophone Company, which later evolved into the Columbia Phonograph Company.",
              "Bell used his proceeds from the sale to endow the Volta Laboratory.",
              "Bell undertook two other noteworthy research projects at the Volta Laboratory.",
              "In 1880 he began research on using light as a means to transmit sound.",
              "In 1873 British scientist Willoughby Smith discovered that the element selenium, a semiconductor, varied its electrical resistance with the intensity of incident light.",
              "Bell sought to use this property to develop the photophone, an invention he regarded as at least equal to his telephone.",
              "He was able to demonstrate that the photophone was technologically feasible, but it did not develop into a commercially viable product.",
              "Nevertheless, it contributed to research into the photovoltaic effect that had practical applications later in the 20th century.",
              "Bell\u2019s other major undertaking was the development of an electrical bullet probe, an early version of the metal detector, for surgical use.",
              "The origin of this effort was the shooting of U.",

              "Bell decided that a promising approach was to use an induction balance, a by-product of his research on canceling out electrical interference on telephone wires.",
              "Bell determined that a properly configured induction balance would emit a tone when a metal object was brought into proximity with it.",
              "At the end of July, he began searching for Garfield\u2019s bullet, but to no avail.",
              "Despite Garfield\u2019s death in September, Bell later successfully demonstrated the probe to a group of doctors.",
              "Surgeons adopted it, and it was credited with saving lives during the Boer War (1899\u20131902) and World War I (1914\u201318).",
              "In September 1885 the Bell family vacationed in Nova Scotia, Canada, and immediately fell in love with the climate and landscape.",
              "The following year, Bell bought 50 acres of land near the village of Baddeck on Cape Breton Island and began constructing an estate he called Beinn Bhreagh, Scots Gaelic for \u201cBeautiful Mountain.",

              "Starting in 1891, inspired by the research of American scientist Samuel Pierpont Langley, he experimented with wing shapes and propeller blade designs.",
              "He continued his experiments even after Wilbur and Orville Wright made the first successful powered, controlled flight in 1903.",
              "In 1907 Bell founded the Aerial Experiment Association, which made significant progress in aircraft design and control and contributed to the career of pioneer aviator Glenn Hammond Curtiss.",

              "The pair demonstrated the probe in the autumn of 1881.",
              "Bell later shifted his attention to aerial technology.",
              "He founded the Aerial Experiment Association in 1907.",
              "The first telephone had two parts: a transmitter and a receiver.",
              "The transmitter comprised three parts\u2014a drumlike device (a cylinder with a covered end), a needle, and a battery.",
              "The covered end of the drumlike device was attached to the needle.",
              "The needle was connected by wire to the battery, and the battery was connected by wire to a receiver.",
              "When Bell spoke into the open end of the drumlike device, his voice made the paper and needle vibrate.",
              "The vibrations were then converted into an electric current which traveled along the wire to the receiver.",
              "Alexander Graham Bell, (born March 3, 1847, Edinburgh, Scotland\u2014died August 2, 1922, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada), Scottish-born American inventor, scientist, and teacher of the deaf whose foremost accomplishments were the invention of the telephone (1876) and the refinement of the phonograph (1886).",
              "Alexander (\u201cGraham\u201d was not added until he was 11) was born to Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds.",
              "His mother was almost deaf, and his father taught elocution to the deaf, influencing Alexander\u2019s later career choice as teacher of the deaf.",
              "At age 11 he entered the Royal High School at Edinburgh, but he did not enjoy the compulsory curriculum, and he left school at age 15 without graduating.",
              "In 1865 the family moved to London.",
              "Alexander passed the entrance examinations for University College London in June 1868 and matriculated there in the autumn.",
              "However, he did not complete his studies, because in 1870 the Bell family moved again, this time immigrating to Canada after the deaths of Bell\u2019s younger brother Edward in 1867 and older brother Melville in 1870, both of tuberculosis.",
              "The family settled in Brantford, Ontario, but in April 1871 Alexander moved to Boston, where he taught at the Boston School for Deaf Mutes.",
              "He also taught at the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts, and at the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut.",
              "One of Bell\u2019s students was Mabel Hubbard, daughter of Gardiner Greene Hubbard, a founder of the Clarke School.",
              "Mabel had become deaf at age five as a result of a near-fatal bout of scarlet fever.",
              "Bell began working with her in 1873, when she was 15 years old.",
              "Despite a 10-year age difference, they fell in love and were married on July 11, 1877.",
              "They had four children, Elsie (1878\u20131964), Marian (1880\u20131962), and two sons who died in infancy.",
              "While pursuing his teaching profession, Bell also began researching methods to transmit several telegraph messages simultaneously over a single wire\u2014a major focus of telegraph innovation at the time and one that ultimately led to Bell\u2019s invention of the telephone.",
              "In 1868 Joseph Stearns had invented the duplex, a system that transmitted two messages simultaneously over a single wire.",
              "Western Union Telegraph Company, the dominant firm in the industry, acquired the rights to Stearns\u2019s duplex and hired the noted inventor Thomas Edison to devise as many multiple-transmission methods as possible in order to block competitors from using them.",
              "Edison\u2019s work culminated in the quadruplex, a system for sending four simultaneous telegraph messages over a single wire.",
              "Inventors then sought methods that could send more than four;",
              "some, including Bell and his great rival Elisha Gray, developed designs capable of subdividing a telegraph line into 10 or more channels.",
              "These so-called harmonic telegraphs used reeds or tuning forks that responded to specific acoustic frequencies.",
              "They worked well in the laboratory but proved unreliable in service.",
              "A group of investors led by Gardiner Hubbard wanted to establish a federally chartered telegraph company to compete with Western Union by contracting with the Post Office to send low-cost telegrams. Hubbard saw great promise in the harmonic telegraph and backed Bell\u2019s experiments.",
              "Bell, however, was more interested in transmitting the human voice.",
              "Finally, he and Hubbard worked out an agreement that Bell would devote most of his time to the harmonic telegraph but would continue developing his telephone concept.",
              "From harmonic telegraphs transmitting musical tones, it was a short conceptual step for both Bell and Gray to transmit the human voice.",
              "Bell filed a patent describing his method of transmitting sounds on February 14, 1876, just hours before Gray filed a caveat (a statement of concept) on a similar method.",
              "On March 7, 1876, the Patent Office awarded Bell what is said to be one of the most valuable patents in history.",
              "It is most likely that both Bell and Gray independently devised their telephone designs as an outgrowth of their work on harmonic telegraphy.",
              "However, the question of priority of invention between the two has been controversial from the very beginning.",
              "Despite having the patent, Bell did not have a fully functioning instrument.",
              "He first produced intelligible speech on March 10, 1876, when he summoned his laboratory assistant, Thomas A.",
              "Watson, with words that Bell transcribed in his lab notes as \u201cMr.",
              "Watson\u2014come here\u2014I want to see you.",
              "\u201d Over the next few months, Bell continued to refine his instrument to make it suitable for public exhibition.",
              "In June he demonstrated his telephone to the judges of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, a test witnessed by Brazil\u2019s Emperor Pedro II and the celebrated Scottish physicist Sir William Thomson.",
              "In August of that year, he was on the receiving end of the first one-way long-distance call, transmitted from Brantford to nearby Paris, Ontario, over a telegraph wire.",
              "Gardiner Hubbard organized a group that established the Bell Telephone Company in July 1877 to commercialize Bell\u2019s telephone.",
              "Bell was the company\u2019s technical adviser until he lost interest in telephony in the early 1880s.",
              "Although his invention rendered him independently wealthy, he sold off most of his stock holdings in the company early and did not profit as much as he might have had he retained his shares.",
              "Thus, by the mid-1880s his role in the telephone industry was marginal.",
              "By that time, Bell had developed a growing interest in the technology of sound recording and playback.",
              "Although Edison had invented the phonograph in 1877, he soon turned his attention to other technologies, especially electric power and lighting, and his machine, which recorded and reproduced sound on a rotating cylinder wrapped in tinfoil, remained an unreliable and cumbersome device.",
              "In 1880 the French government awarded Bell the Volta Prize, given for achievement in electrical science.",
              "Bell used the prize money to set up his Volta Laboratory, an institution devoted to studying deafness and improving the lives of the deaf, in Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              "There he also devoted himself to improving the phonograph.",
              "By 1885 Bell and his colleagues (his cousin Chichester A.",
              "Bell and the inventor Charles Sumner Tainter) had a design fit for commercial use that featured a removable cardboard cylinder coated with mineral wax.",
              "They called their device the Graphophone and applied for patents, which were granted in 1886.",
              "The group formed the Volta Graphophone Company to produce their invention.",
              "Then in 1887 they sold their patents to the American Graphophone Company, which later evolved into the Columbia Phonograph Company.",
              "Bell used his proceeds from the sale to endow the Volta Laboratory.",
              "Bell undertook two other noteworthy research projects at the Volta Laboratory.",
              "In 1880 he began research on using light as a means to transmit sound.",
              "In 1873 British scientist Willoughby Smith discovered that the element selenium, a semiconductor, varied its electrical resistance with the intensity of incident light.",
              "Bell sought to use this property to develop the photophone, an invention he regarded as at least equal to his telephone.",
              "He was able to demonstrate that the photophone was technologically feasible, but it did not develop into a commercially viable product.",
              "Nevertheless, it contributed to research into the photovoltaic effect that had practical applications later in the 20th century.",
              "Bell\u2019s other major undertaking was the development of an electrical bullet probe, an early version of the metal detector, for surgical use.",
              "The origin of this effort was the shooting of U.",
              "S.",

              "Garfield in July 1881.",
              "A bullet lodged in the president\u2019s back, and doctors were unable to locate it through physical probing.",
              "Bell decided that a promising approach was to use an induction balance, a by-product of his research on canceling out electrical interference on telephone wires.",
              "Bell determined that a properly configured induction balance would emit a tone when a metal object was brought into proximity with it.",
              "At the end of July, he began searching for Garfield\u2019s bullet, but to no avail.",
              "Despite Garfield\u2019s death in September, Bell later successfully demonstrated the probe to a group of doctors.",
              "Surgeons adopted it, and it was credited with saving lives during the Boer War (1899\u20131902) and World War I (1914\u201318).",
              "In September 1885 the Bell family vacationed in Nova Scotia, Canada, and immediately fell in love with the climate and landscape.",
              "The following year, Bell bought 50 acres of land near the village of Baddeck on Cape Breton Island and began constructing an estate he called Beinn Bhreagh, Scots Gaelic for \u201cBeautiful Mountain.",
              "\u201d The Scottish-born inventor had been an American citizen since 1882, but the Canadian estate became the family\u2019s summer retreat and later permanent home.",
              "During the 1890s Bell shifted his attention to heavier-than-air flight.",
              "Starting in 1891, inspired by the research of American scientist Samuel Pierpont Langley, he experimented with wing shapes and propeller blade designs.",
              "He continued his experiments even after Wilbur and Orville Wright made the first successful powered, controlled flight in 1903.",
              "In 1907 Bell founded the Aerial Experiment Association, which made significant progress in aircraft design and control and contributed to the career of pioneer aviator Glenn Hammond Curtiss.",
              "Throughout his life, Bell sought to foster the advance of scientific knowledge.",
              "He supported the journal Science, which later became the official publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
              "He succeeded his father-in-law, Gardiner Hubbard, as president of the National Geographic Society (1898\u20131903).",
              "In 1903 his son-in-law, Gilbert H.",

              "Bell's mother was deaf/hearing impaired and he would often speak to her by placing his mouth close to her forehead, believing the vibrations from his voice would help her distinguish speech more clearly than using an ear trumpet.",
              "Although he married a deaf woman, a former speech pupil, Mabel Hubbard, Bell strongly opposed intermarriage among congenitally deaf people.",
              "Bell feared \"contamination\" of the human race by the propagation of deaf people even though most deaf people statistically are born to hearing parents.",

              "In this paper, he proposed to reduce the number of the deaf by discouraging deaf-mute to deaf-mute marriages, advocating speech reading and articulation training for an oral-only method of education, removing the use of deaf teachers and sign language from the classroom.",
              "Suggestions were made to enact legislation to prevent the intermarriage of deaf-mute people or forbidding marriage between families that have more than one deaf-mute member.",

              "In a nutshell, VOIP technology allows calls to be placed over internet-connected devices without the use of telephone infrastructure or private PBX (Personal Branch Exchange) systems, although VOIP can be hosted on internal company PBX\u2019s, and originally was exclusive to those systems. The VOIP revolution allowed the development of new types of mobile, desktop, and computer-based calling devices and applications, none of which were beholden to traditional telephone service providers.",

              "Even as a solo entrepreneur, you can have a complete business calling solution which used to require lots of expensive equipment and service, full-time technical support, and physical limitations which kept most small and medium size businesses from accessing the benefits of these systems. VOIP technology is so powerful, you could even run a full call center with hundreds of representatives on a 100% remote basis.",
              "From the simplest of beginnings (\u201cWatson, come here!",
              "\u201d), the telephone was one of the most powerful influences on the explosion of technological and economic development in the late 19th and 20th century.",

              "Reginald Aubrey Fessenden (October 6, 1866 \u2013 July 22, 1932) was a Canadian-born inventor, who did a majority of his work in the United States and also claimed U.",

              "citizenship through his American-born father.",
              "[1] During his life he received hundreds of patents in various fields, most notably ones related to radio and sonar.",
              "Fessenden is best known for his pioneering work developing radio technology, including the foundations of amplitude modulation (AM) radio.",
              "His achievements included the first transmission of speech by radio (1900), and the first two-way radiotelegraphic communication across the Atlantic Ocean (1906).",
              "In 1932 he reported that, in late 1906, he also made the first radio broadcast of entertainment and music, although a lack of verifiable details has led to some doubts about this claim.",
              "Reginald Fessenden was born October 6, 1866, in East Bolton, Canada East, the eldest of the Reverend Elisha Joseph Fessenden and Clementina Trenholme's four children.",
              "Elisha Fessenden was a Church of England in Canada minister, and the family moved to a number of postings throughout the province of Ontario.",
              "[2] While growing up Fessenden attended a number of educational institutions.",
              "At the young age of nine he was enrolled in the DeVeaux Military school for a year.",
              "He next attended Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, from 1877 until the summer of 1879.",
              "He also spent a year working for the Imperial Bank at Woodstock because he had not yet reached the age of 16 needed to enroll in college.",
              "At the age of fourteen, he returned to his hometown in the Eastern Townships and went to the nearby Bishop's College School, which granted him a mathematics mastership (teaching job)[3] and a scholarship for studying in its college division at University of Bishop's College.",
              "Thus, while Fessenden was still a teenager, he taught mathematics to the school's younger students (some older than himself) for four years, while simultaneously studying natural sciences with older students at the college.",
              "[4][5] At the age of eighteen, Fessenden left Bishop's without having been awarded a degree, although he had \"done substantially all the work necessary\", in order to accept a position at the Whitney Institute, near to Flatts Village in Bermuda, where for the next two years he worked as the headmaster and sole teacher.",
              "(This lack of a degree may have hurt Fessenden's employment opportunities.",
              "When McGill University in Montreal established an electrical engineering department, his application to become its chairman was turned down.)",
              "While in Bermuda, he became engaged to Helen May Trott of Smith's Parish.",
              "[6][7] They married on September 21, 1890, in the United States at Manhattan in New York City,[8] and later had a son, Reginald Kennelly Fessenden, born May 7, 1893, in Lafayette, Allen, Indiana.",
              "[9] Fessenden's classical education provided him with only a limited amount of scientific and technical training.",
              "Interested in increasing his skills in the electrical field, he moved to New York City in 1886, with hopes of gaining employment with the famous inventor, Thomas Edison.",
              "However, his initial attempts were rebuffed;",
              "in his first application Fessenden wrote, \"Do not know anything about electricity, but can learn pretty quick,\" to which Edison replied, \"Have enough men now who do not know about electricity.\"",
              "However, Fessenden persevered, and before the end of the year was hired for a semi-skilled position as an assistant tester for the Edison Machine Works, which was laying underground electrical mains in New York City.",
              "He quickly proved his worth, and received a series of promotions, with increasing responsibility for the project.",
              "In late 1886, Fessenden began working directly for Edison at the inventor's new laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, as a junior technician.",
              "[7] He participated in a broad range of projects, which included work in solving problems in chemistry, metallurgy, and electricity.",
              "However, in 1890, facing financial problems, Edison was forced to lay off most of the laboratory employees, including Fessenden.",
              "[10] (Fessenden remained an admirer of Edison his entire life, and in 1925 stated that \"there is only one figure in history which stands in the same rank as him as an inventor, i.",
              "e.",
              "Archimedes\".)",
              "[11] Taking advantage of his recent practical experience, Fessenden was able to find positions with a series of manufacturing companies.",
              "In 1892, he received an appointment as professor for the newly formed Electrical Engineering department at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana;",
              "while there he helped the Westinghouse Corporation install the lighting for the 1893 Chicago World Columbian Exposition.",
              "Later that year, George Westinghouse personally recruited Fessenden for the newly created position of chair of the Electrical Engineering department at the Western University of Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh (now the University of Pittsburgh).",
              "[12][13] In the late 1890s, reports began to appear about the success Guglielmo Marconi was having in developing a practical system of transmitting and receiving radio signals, then commonly known as \"wireless telegraphy\".",
              "Fessenden began limited radio experimentation, and soon came to the conclusion that he could develop a far more efficient system than the spark-gap transmitter and coherer-receiver combination which had been created by Oliver Lodge and Marconi.",
              "By 1899 he was able to send radiotelegraph messages between Pittsburgh and Allegheny City (now an area of Pittsburgh), using a receiver of his own design.",
              "[14] In 1900 Fessenden left Pittsburgh to work for the United States Weather Bureau, with the objective of demonstrating the practicality of using coastal stations to transmit weather information, thereby avoiding the expense of the existing telegraph lines.",
              "The contract called for him to be paid $3,000 per year and provided with work space, assistance, and housing.",
              "[15] Fessenden would retain ownership of any inventions, but the agreement also gave the Weather Bureau royalty-free use of any discoveries made during the term of the contract.",
              "Fessenden quickly made major advances, especially in receiver design, as he worked to develop audio reception of signals.",
              "His initial success came from the invention of a barretter detector.",
              "This was followed by an electrolytic detector, consisting of a fine wire dipped in nitric acid, which for the next few years set the standard for sensitivity in radio reception.",
              "[16] As his work progressed, Fessenden also developed the heterodyne principle, which used two closely spaced radio signals to produce an audible tone that made Morse code transmissions much easier to hear.",
              "However, heterodyne reception would not become practical for a decade after it was invented, because it required a method for producing a stable local signal, which would not become available until the development of the oscillating vacuum-tube.",
              "[17] Fessenden's initial Weather Bureau work took place at Cobb Island, Maryland, located in the Potomac River about 80 kilometers (50 mi) downstream from Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              "As the experimentation expanded, additional stations were built along the Atlantic Coast in North Carolina and Virginia.",
              "However, in the midst of promising advances, Fessenden became embroiled in disputes with his sponsor.",
              "In particular, he charged that Bureau Chief Willis Moore had attempted to gain a half-share of the patents.",
              "Fessenden refused to sign over the rights, and his work for the Weather Bureau ended in August 1902.",
              "[18] In November 1902, two wealthy Pittsburgh businessmen, Hay Walker Jr.",
              "and Thomas H.",
              "Given, financed the formation of the National Electric Signaling Company (NESCO) to support Fessenden's research.",
              "Initially the new company was based in Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              ", where a station was constructed for experimental and demonstration purposes.",
              "Two additional demonstration stations were constructed at Collingswood, New Jersey (near Philadelphia) and Jersey City, New Jersey (near New York City).",
              "[20] In 1904 an attempt was made to link the General Electric plants in Schenectady, New York, and Lynn, Massachusetts, a distance of 185 miles (298 km), however the effort was unsuccessful.",
              "[21] Efforts to sell equipment to the U.",
              "S.",
              "and other governments, as well as private companies, met with little success.",
              "An ongoing area of conflict, especially with the U.",
              "S.",
              "Navy, were the high prices Fessenden tried to charge.",
              "The Navy in particular felt Fessenden's quotes were too far above the device's manufacturing costs to be considered reasonable, and contracted with other companies to build equipment that used Fessenden designs.",
              "This led to bad feelings and a series of patent infringement lawsuits.",
              "An alternate plan to sell the company as a whole was unsuccessful in finding a buyer.",
              "Eventually a radical change in company orientation took place.",
              "In 1904 it was decided to compete with the existing ocean cables, by setting up a transatlantic radiotelegraph link.",
              "The headquarters for company operations was moved to Brant Rock, Massachusetts, which was to be the western terminal for the proposed new service.",
              "[22] The plan was to conduct the transatlantic service using Fessenden-designed rotary spark-gap transmitters.",
              "A 420-foot (128 meter) guyed antenna was constructed at Brant Rock, with a similar tower erected at Machrihanish in western Scotland.",
              "In January 1906, these stations made the first successful two-way transmission across the Atlantic, exchanging Morse code messages.",
              "(Marconi had only achieved one-way transmissions at this time.)",
              "However, the system was unable to reliably bridge this distance when the sun was up, or during the summer months when interference levels were higher, so work was suspended until later in the year.",
              "Then, on December 6, 1906, the Machrihanish radio tower collapsed in a gale,[23] abruptly ending the transatlantic project before it could begin commercial service.",
              "(A detailed review in Engineering magazine blamed the collapse on sub-standard construction, due to \"the way in which the joints were made by the man employed for the purpose by the sub-contractors to whom the work was entrusted by the Brown Hoisting Machinery Company\" and \"The only wonder is that the tower did not fall before.\"",
              ")[24] In a letter published in the January 19, 1907, issue of Scientific American, Fessenden discounted the effect of the tower collapse, stating that \"The working up to the date of the accident was, however, so successful that the directors of the National Electric Signaling Company have decided that it is unnecessary to carry on the experimental developments any further, and specifications are being drawn up for the erection of five stations for doing transatlantic and other cable work, and a commercial permit is being applied for in England.\"",
              "[25] However, the tower collapse did in fact mark the end of NESCO's transatlantic efforts.",
              "[26] Fessenden had a very early interest in the possibility of making audio radio transmissions, in contrast to the early spark-gap transmissions that could only transmit Morse code messages.",
              "As early as 1891, he had investigated sending alternating currents of varying frequencies along telegraph lines, in order to create a multiplex telegraph system.",
              "[27] He would later apply the knowledge gained about tuning and resonance from his alternating current electrical work to the higher frequency currents used in radio, in order to develop the concept of continuous-wave radio signals.",
              "[28] Fessenden's basic approach was disclosed in U.",
              "S.",
              "Patent 706,737, which he applied for on May 29, 1901, and was issued the next year.",
              "It called for the use of a high-speed alternator (referred to as \"an alternating-current dynamo\") that generated \"pure sine waves\" and produced \"a continuous train of radiant waves of substantially uniform strength\", or, in modern terminology, a continuous-wave (CW) transmitter.",
              "[29] The idea of using continuous-wave radio signals was in direct conflict with the current orthodoxy that the abrupt \"whiplash\" effect produced by large electrical sparks was needed in order to create adequately strong signals.",
              "John Ambrose Fleming, a Marconi associate, was particularly dismissive in his book The Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy, a detailed review of the state of the art as he saw it that was published in 1906.",
              "Reviewing Fessenden's patent, he wrote that \"The creation of an electric wave seems to involve a certain suddenness in the beginning of the oscillations, and an alternator giving a simple sine-curve would not be likely to produce the required effect.",
              ".",
              ".\"",
              "[30] (In view of Fessenden's ultimate success, this statement disappeared from the book's 1916 edition.)",
              "Fessenden's next step, taken from standard wire-telephone practice, was to insert a simple carbon microphone into the transmission line, which was used to modulate the carrier wave signal for audio transmissions, or, again using modern terms, used to produce amplitude modulated (AM) radio signals.",
              "[31] Fessenden began his research on audio transmissions while still on Cobb Island.",
              "Because he did not yet have a continuous-wave transmitter, initially he worked with an experimental \"high-frequency spark\" transmitter, taking advantage of the fact that the higher the spark rate, the closer a spark-gap transmission comes to producing continuous waves.",
              "He later reported that, on December 23, 1900, he successfully transmitted speech over a distance of about 1.",
              "6 kilometers (one mile), saying;",
              "\u201cOne, two, three, four.",
              "Is It snowing where you are, Mr.",
              "Thiessen?",
              "If so, telegraph back and let me know\u201d, which appears to have been the first successful audio transmission using radio signals.",
              "[32][33] However, at this time the sound was far too distorted to be commercially practical, although as a test this did show that with further refinements it would become possible to effectively transmit sounds by radio.",
              "[34] Others claim the honor of using radiowaves to transmit their voice goes to the Brazilian priest and inventor Roberto Landell de Moura some months earlier, with reports saying the transmission reached 8 km on June 3, 1900.",
              "[35] For a time Fessenden continued working with more sophisticated high-frequency spark transmitters, including versions that used compressed air, which began to take on some of the characteristics of arc-transmitters patented by Valdemar Poulsen.",
              "[36] Fessenden unsuccessfully attempted to sell this form of radiotelephone, later noting: \"In 1904, with a 20,000 frequency spark and compressed nitrogen gap, such good results were obtained that a demonstration was given to a number of electrical engineers, who signed affidavits that they considered the articulation as commercially good over twenty-five miles, and the sets were advertised for sale.",
              ".",
              ".\"",
              "[37] (In a 1908 review, he conceded that with this approach \"The transmission was, however, still not absolutely perfect.\"",
              ")[38] Fessenden's ultimate plan for an audio-capable transmitter was to take a basic electrical alternator, which normally rotated at speeds that produced alternating current of at most a few hundred cycles-per-second (Hz), and greatly increase its rotational speed, in order to create electrical currents of tens-of-thousands of cycles-per-second (kHz), thus producing a steady continuous-wave transmission when connected to an aerial.",
              "However, it would take many years of expensive development before even a prototype alternator-transmitter would be ready, and a few years beyond that for high-power versions to become available.",
              "One concern was whether at these high speeds the alternator might disintegrate due to the high rotation speed tearing it apart.",
              "Because of this, as a precaution, while the alternator was being initially developed it was \"placed in a pit surrounded by sandbags\".",
              "[39] Fessenden contracted with General Electric (GE) to help design and produce a series of high-frequency alternator-transmitters.",
              "In 1903, Charles Proteus Steinmetz of GE delivered a 10 kHz version which proved of limited use and could not be directly used as a radio transmitter.",
              "Fessenden's request for a faster, more powerful unit was assigned to Ernst F.",
              "W.",
              "Alexanderson, who in August 1906 delivered an improved model which operated at a transmitting frequency of approximately 50 kHz, although with far less power than Fessenden's rotary-spark transmitters.",
              "[40] The alternator-transmitter achieved the goal of transmitting quality audio signals, but the lack of any way to amplify the signals meant they were somewhat weak.",
              "On December 21, 1906, Fessenden made an extensive demonstration of the new alternator-transmitter at Brant Rock, showing its utility for point-to-point wireless telephony, including interconnecting his stations to the wire telephone network.",
              "As part of the demonstration, speech was transmitted 18 kilometers (11 miles) to a listening site at Plymouth, Massachusetts.",
              "A detailed review of this demonstration appeared in The American Telephone Journal[32] and a summary by Fessenden appeared in Scientific American.",
              "[41] A portion of a report produced by Greenleaf W.",
              "Pickard of the Telephone Company's Boston office, which includes additional information on some still existing defects, appeared in Ernst Ruhmer's Wireless Telephony in Theory and Practice.",

              "[43] Until the early 1930s, it was generally accepted that Lee de Forest, who conducted a series of test broadcasts beginning in 1907, and who was widely quoted promoting the potential of organized radio broadcasting, was the first person to transmit music and entertainment by radio.",
              "De Forest's first entertainment broadcast occurred in February 1907, when he transmitted electronic telharmonium music from his laboratory station in New York City.",
              "[44] This was followed by tests that included, in the fall, Eugenia Farrar singing \"I Love You Truly\".",

              "Davis, commenting on entertainment offerings, asserted that \"Reginald Fessenden, probably the first to attempt this, broadcast a program Christmas Eve 1906\",[46] but did not provide any additional details, and his comment was little noticed at the time.",
              "[47] The first widely publicized information about Fessenden's early broadcasts did not appear until 1932, when an article prepared by former Fessenden associate Samuel M.",
              "Kintner, \"Pittsburgh's Contributions to Radio\", appeared in the December 1932 issue of The Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers.",
              "[48] This reviewed information included in a January 29, 1932, letter sent by Fessenden to Kintner.",
              "(Fessenden subsequently died five months before Kintner's article appeared).",
              "In this account, Fessenden reported that on the evening of December 24, 1906 (Christmas Eve), he had made the first of two radio broadcasts of music and entertainment to a general audience, using the alternator-transmitter at Brant Rock.",
              "Fessenden remembered producing a short program that included a phonograph record of Ombra mai fu (Largo) by George Frideric Handel, followed by Fessenden playing Adolphe Adam's carol O Holy Night on the violin and singing Adore and be Still by Gounod, and closing with a biblical passage: \"Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will\" (Luke 2:14).",
              "He also stated that a second short program was broadcast on December 31 (New Year's Eve).",
              "The intended audience for both of these transmissions was primarily shipboard radio operators along the Atlantic seaboard.",
              "Fessenden claimed that the two programs had been widely publicized in advance, and the Christmas Eve broadcast had been heard \"as far down\" as Norfolk, Virginia, while the New Year Eve's broadcast had reached listeners in the West Indies.",
              "[49] Anticipation of the 2006 centennial anniversary of Fessenden's reported broadcasts brought renewed interest, as well as additional questions.",
              "A key issue was why, despite Fessenden's assertion that the two programs had been widely heard, there did not appear to be any independent corroborating evidence for his account.",
              "(Even the Helen Fessenden biography relies exclusively on details contained in the January 29, 1932, letter used by the Kintner article.)",
              "There was general consensus in the centennial discussions that Fessenden had the technical means to make broadcasts, given the widespread reports about the success of the December 21 alternator-transmitter demonstrations.",
              "However, because of the station's very low power, even if the broadcasts had taken place it was questionable if the range could have matched Fessenden's claim of being heard hundreds of kilometers away.",

              "O'Neal conducted extensive research, but did not find any ships' radio log accounts, or any contemporary literature, to confirm the reported holiday broadcasts.",
              "[50] A follow-up article two years later further reported that a similar attempt to verify the details of the broadcasts had taken place in 1956, which had also failed to uncover any confirmation of Fessenden's statements.",
              "One alternate possibility proposed by O'Neal was that perhaps something similar to what Fessenden remembered could have taken place during a series of tests conducted in 1909.",

              "[52] Jack Belrose flatly argued that there was no reason to doubt Fessenden's account, in part because it had not been challenged in the years immediately following publication of the Kintner article.",
              "[53] Although Fessenden's claim for the first radio broadcast in 1906 is recognized as an IEEE Milestone,[54] in view of the contrasting opinions among radio historians, Mike Adams summarized the situation as \"More than 100 years after its possible occurrence, the Fessenden 'first broadcaster' controversy continues.\"",
              "[55] The American Telephone Journal account of the December 21 alternator-transmitter demonstration included the statement that \"It is admirably adapted to the transmission of news, music, etc.",
              "as, owing to the fact that no wires are needed, simultaneous transmission to many subscribers can be effected as easily as to a few\",[32] echoing the words of a handout distributed to the demonstration witnesses, which stated \"[Radio] Telephony is admirably adapted for transmitting news, stock quotations, music, race reports, etc.",
              "simultaneously over a city, on account of the fact that no wires are needed and a single apparatus can distribute to ten thousand subscribers as easily as to a few.",
              "It is proposed to erect stations for this purpose in the large cities here and abroad.\"",
              "[56] However, other than the two reported holiday transmissions, Fessenden does not appear to have conducted any other radio broadcasts, or to have even given additional thought about the potential of a regular broadcast service.",
              "In a 1908 comprehensive review of \"Wireless Telephony\", he included a section titled \"possibilities\" that listed promising radio telephone uses.",
              "Neither the main article, nor this list, makes any reference to broadcasting, instead only noting conventional applications of point-to-point communication, enumerated as \"local exchanges\", \"long-distance lines\", \"transmarine transmission\", \"wireless telephony from ship to ship\", and \"wireless telephone from ship to local exchange\".",
              "[57] The technical achievements made by Fessenden were not matched by financial success.",
              "Walker and Given continued to hope to sell NESCO to a larger company such as the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T).",
              "After the December 21, 1906, demonstrations, AT&T was said to be planning to acquire NESCO, but financial setbacks caused the telephone company to reconsider, and NESCO was unable to find another buyer.",
              "There were growing strains between Fessenden and the company owners, and Fessenden's formation of the Fessenden Wireless Company of Canada in Montreal in 1906 may have led to suspicion that he was trying to freeze Walker and Given out of a potentially lucrative competing transatlantic service.",
              "The final break occurred in January 1911, when Fessenden was formally dismissed from NESCO.",
              "This resulted in his bringing suit against NESCO, for breach of contract.",
              "Fessenden won the initial court trial and was awarded damages;",
              "however, NESCO prevailed on appeal.",
              "To conserve assets, NESCO went into receivership in 1912, and Samuel Kintner was appointed general manager of the company.",
              "The legal stalemate would continue for over 15 years.",
              "In 1917, NESCO finally emerged from receivership, and was soon renamed the International Radio Telegraph Company.",
              "The company limped along for a few years, until it was sold to the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company in 1920, and the next year its assets, including numerous important Fessenden patents, were sold to the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which also inherited the longstanding Fessenden legal proceedings.",
              "Finally, on March 31, 1928, Fessenden settled his outstanding lawsuits with RCA, receiving a significant cash settlement.",
              "[58] After Fessenden left NESCO, Ernst Alexanderson continued to work on alternator-transmitter development at General Electric, mostly for long range radiotelegraph use.",
              "He eventually developed the high-powered Alexanderson alternator, capable of transmitting across the Atlantic, and by 1916 the Fessenden-Alexanderson alternator was more reliable for transoceanic communication than the spark transmitters which were originally used to provide this service.",
              "Also, after 1920 radio broadcasting became widespread, and although the stations used vacuum-tube transmitters rather than alternator-transmitters (which vacuum-tubes made obsolete), they employed the same continuous-wave AM signals that Fessenden had introduced in 1906.",
              "[59] Although Fessenden ceased radio research after his dismissal from NESCO in 1911, he continued to work in other fields.",
              "As early as 1904 he had helped engineer the Niagara Falls power plant for the newly formed Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario.",
              "However, his most extensive work was in marine communication as consulting engineer with the Submarine Signal Company which built a widely used aid to navigation using bells, termed a submarine signal, acting much as an underwater foghorn.",
              "While there, he invented the Fessenden oscillator, an electromechanical transducer.",
              "Though the company immediately began replacing bells and primitive receivers on ships with the new device, it was also the basis for entirely new applications: underwater telegraphy and sonic distance measurement.",
              "The later was the basis for sonar (SOund NAvigation Ranging), echo-sounding and the principle applied to radar (RAdio Detection And Ranging).",
              "The device was soon put to use for submarines to signal each other, as well as a method for locating icebergs, to help avoid another disaster like the one that sank Titanic.",
              "While the company quickly applied his invention to replace the bells of its systems and entered acoustic telegraphy it ignored the echo ranging potential.",
              "[60][61][62] The echo sounding was invented in 1912 by German physicist Alexander Behm.",
              "[63] At the outbreak of World War I, Fessenden volunteered his services to the Canadian government and was sent to London where he developed a device to detect enemy artillery and another to locate enemy submarines.",
              "[64] Other efforts included a version of microfilm, that helped him to keep a compact record of his inventions, projects and patents.",
              "He also patented the basic ideas leading to reflection seismology, a technique important for its use in exploring for petroleum, and received patents for diverse subjects that included tracer bullets, paging, television apparatus, and a turbo electric drive for ships.",
              "[citation needed] An inveterate tinkerer, Fessenden eventually became the holder of more than 500 patents.",
              "He could often be found in a river or lake, floating on his back, a cigar sticking out of his mouth and a hat pulled down over his eyes.",
              "[65] At home he liked to lie on the carpet, a cat on his chest.",
              "In this state of relaxation, Fessenden could imagine, invent and think his way to new ideas.",
              "Fessenden also had a reputation for being temperamental, although in his defense his wife later stated that \"Fessenden was never a difficult man to W O R K with but he was an intensely difficult man to play politics with.\"",
              "[66] However, one of his former assistants, Charles J.",
              "Pannill, recalled that \"He was a great character, of splendid physique, but what a temper!\"",
              ", while a second, Roy Weagant, ruefully noted that \"He could be very nice at times, but only at times.\"",
              "[65] In 1925, Radio News, saluting Fessenden as \"one of the greatest American radio inventors\", began a monthly autobiographical series titled \"The Inventions of Reginald A.",
              "Fessenden\", with the intention of publishing the completed installments as a book.",
              "However, instead of reviewing his radio work, Fessenden immediately went on a series of tangents, including discussions of which races he believed were the most capable of producing inventions, and the proper approach that government institutions should be taking in order to support inventors.",
              "(At the close of the seventh installment, Radio News included a disclaimer that it was \"not responsible for any opinions expressed in Dr.",
              "Fessenden's article\".)",
              "[67] After eleven installments Fessenden had only covered his life up to 1893, having discussed virtually nothing about radio, and the series was quietly terminated at this point.",
              "[68] In 1921, the Institute of Radio Engineers presented Fessenden with its IRE Medal of Honor.",
              "[69] The medallion was gold plated, and somehow Fessenden became convinced that earlier awards had been solid gold, so he angrily returned it.",
              "Only after Greenleaf W.",
              "Pickard investigated the matter and determined that the prior medals were also plated was Fessenden willing to relent.",
              "The next year Philadelphia's Board of Directors of City Trusts awarded Fessenden a John Scott Medal, which included a cash prize of $800, for \"his invention of a reception scheme for continuous wave telegraphy and telephony\",[70] and recognized him as \"One whose labors had been of great benefit.\"",
              "There was suspicion by Fessenden that these two awards had not been made in sincerity but in order to placate him.",
              "In his wife's biography, referring to the IRE medal, she quoted the proverb \"beware of Greeks bearing gifts\".",
              "The Scott Medal came under additional suspicion because it had been awarded at the suggestion of Westinghouse engineers, who were working for a company that had had financial disputes with Fessenden.",
              "In Helen Fessenden's opinion, \"The Medal cost [Westinghouse] nothing and was a good 'sop to Cereberus'\", and overall compared the medals to \"small change for tips in the pockets of Big Business\".",
              "In 1929 Fessenden was awarded Scientific American's Safety at Sea Gold Medal, in recognition of his invention \"of the Fathometer and other safety instruments for safety at sea\".",

              "He met Thomas Edison and in 1887 went to work at the new Edison Laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, where he became chief chemist.",
              "In 1890 he was laid off from the Edison Laboratory and went to work for the Westinghouse Electric Company in Newark, New Jersey.",
              "In 1891 he transferred to the Stanley Company, a small electric company in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.",
              "In 1892 that company folded, and Fessenden turned to an academic career as professor of electrical engineering, first at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, and then at the Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh), where he received funding from the Westinghouse company and worked on the problem of wireless communication.",

              "Fessenden further contributed to the development of radio by demonstrating the heterodyne principle of converting low-frequency sound signals to high-frequency wireless signals that would be more easily controlled and amplified before the original low-frequency signal was recovered by the receiver.",
              "This was the forerunner of the principle of superheterodyne reception, which made easy tuning of radio signals possible and was a critical factor for the later growth of commercial broadcasting.",

              "He directed Ernst Alexanderson of the General Electric Company in building a 50,000-hertz alternator that could be used as a long-distance high-frequency radio transmitter.",
              "In January 1906 Fessenden established transatlantic wireless telegraphic communication between Brant Rock and Machrihanish, though the service was variable and unreliable.",
              "Later that year he received word from Machrihanish that the Scottish station had picked up voices that were being transmitted between the Brant Rock station and another station in nearby Plymouth, Massachusetts.",

              "MTS was the radiotelephone equivalent of land dial phone service.",
              "The Mobile Telephone Service was one of the earliest mobile telephone standards.",
              "It was operator assisted in both directions, meaning that if one were called from a land line the call would be routed to a mobile operator, who would route it to one's phone.",
              "Similarly, to make an outbound call one had to go through the mobile operator, who would ask for the mobile number and the number to be called, and would then place the call.",
              "This service originated with the Bell System, and was first used in St.",
              "Louis, Missouri, United States on June 17, 1946.",
              "The original equipment weighed 80 pounds (36 kg), and there were initially only 3 channels for all the users in the metropolitan area, later more licenses were added bringing the total to 32 channels across 3 bands (see IMTS frequencies).",
              "This service was used at least into the 1980s in large portions of North America.",
              "[1] On October 2, 1946, Motorola communications equipment carried the first calls on Illinois Bell Telephone Company's new car radiotelephone service in Chicago.",
              "[2][3] Due to the small number of radio frequencies available, the service quickly reached capacity.",
              "MTS was replaced by Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS), introduced in 1964.",
              "MTS uses 25 VHF radio channels in the United States and Canada.",
              "The channels are identified by pairs of letters taken from positions on a North American telephone dial that, when changed to digits, form (for 12-channel mobile sets) 55, 57, 95 and 97.",
              "[clarification needed] In the 1960s plan, the VHF high-band allocations provided for 11 channels in the United States: JL, YL, JP, YP, YJ, YK, JS, YS, YR, JK and JR.",
              "In Canada, two additional channels were available: JJ and JW.",
              "These channels are prone to network congestion and interference since a radio closer to the terminal will sometimes take over the channel due to having a more powerful signal.",
              "The service uses technology that has been manufacturer discontinued for more than three decades.",
              "The driver for replacement in most of North America, particularly large cities, was congestion, the inability of the network to carry more than two dozen channels in a geographic area.",
              "Cellular service resolved this congestion problem very effectively, especially since cellular frequencies, typically UHF, do not reach as far as VHF frequencies and can therefore be reused.",
              "The ability of a cellular system to use signal strength to choose channels and split cells into smaller units also helps expand channel capacity.",
              "The driver for replacement in remote areas, however, is not network congestion, but obsolescence.",
              "Because the equipment is no longer manufactured, companies still using the service must struggle to keep their equipment operating, either by cannibalising from retired equipment or improvising solutions.",
              "Due to insufficient traffic, cellular is not a cost-effective replacement.",
              "Currently, the only viable solution is satellite telephony, as the small number of \"base stations\" which orbit the planet serve large geographic regions as they pass over.",
              "Cost, however, has been an issue, and the replacement has become acceptable to VHF mobile customers gradually, as the cost of satellite telephony has been dropping and will continue to drop.",
              "Many MTS frequencies are now used for local paging services.",
              "They are only found in some parts of rural North America, having been replaced in most areas by cellular service in the 1980s or later.",
              "All calls were placed by a suitably equipped telephone operator.",
              "Outgoing calls were placed when the operator connected to a base station (originally using a cord board, but by the 1990s could be done by dialing a code sequence from a TOPS position), then announced the call over the channel (giving the channel's name first), e.",
              "g., The page would usually be repeated twice more after a pause.",
              "The called party had to have their unit on and the volume set at a level that allowed them to notice a call and then listen to the called number.",
              "If the called party heard an incoming call, they would then use the microphone to announce they were receiving the call, and the operator would allow the two parties to speak, monitoring for the end of the call and marking a manual ticket for billing.",

              "B.",

              "AGT in Alberta used seven-character numbers.",
              "Soon enough, customer equipment, \"selective call\", was developed that had a built-in circuit that could be programmed to recognize a five-digit code as its own, in a manner similar to IMTS systems and crude compared to cellular phones.",
              "The phone company would assign the customer a number and the customer would have it programmed into the set by the phone company or by a dealer.",
              "The operator would connect to the base station by cord board and key the five-digit number;",
              "in the 1990s, phone operators at TOPS positions would key the five digits after dialing the code to initiate the call and then identify the base station;",
              "a typical TOPS operator code would consist of a two digit sequence for voice-call or selective call, a three digit sequence for the base station, then the customer number.",
              "The base station would signal the five digit sequence;",
              "any and all radios tuned to that base station would detect the sequence and compare it with their own;",
              "if it matched, the unit would signal its user with a bell or buzzer, and the user could then answer and announce the identity of their unit, similar to how a voice-call user would respond.",
              "Calls from mobile units to a base station were started by signaling the operator by pressing the microphone button.",
              "The operator would plug into the channel (automated TOPS systems routed the incoming call through the normal queue), announce availability and the channel name, and the customer would identify their mobile number.",
              "(Security systems were sometimes adopted later to prevent fraud, by the customer giving a confidential number.",
              "In an automated connection to the operator, other radios on the base station could hear the transmission from the station, not what the radio user was transmitting.)",
              "The customer would then specify the details of their call, either to another mobile or to a landline number, which the operator would then place.",
              "The call was manually ticketed prior to the use of TOPS, and automatically ticketed if the mobile user was automatically connected to the TOPS operator.",
              "Very few companies automated MTS to use TOPS as most were able to discontinue MTS services due to the reasons above: they could not meet the service demand except by switching to cellular.",
              "Northwestel was one company still offering MTS that tied the base stations into TOPS.",
              "A variant of MTS used short-wave frequencies, and was known as High Frequency or High Frequency-Single Sideband, so named for using frequencies between 3 and 30 MHz.",
              "These services required far fewer base stations and were used to reach distant locations over vast territories.",
              "The drawback was that the frequencies were extremely noisy from various interference, and were subject to propagation problems due to time of day, mostly due to the sun's effect on the ionosphere.",
              "Northwestel, which discontinued the service shortly after 2000, could not tie this system into TOPS, and had to aurally monitor the channels using speakers to listen for incoming calls.",
              "For billing purposes, many MTS base stations were identified with a very close-by rate center of an automatic exchange.",
              "However, if there was no nearby rate center, they became an \"Other Place Point\".",
              "Phone companies typically identified these, and single points such as an individual telephone in a rural area, using a six-digit combination of 88T-XXX, where T is a digit from 6 to 9, and X is any digit 0-9.",
              "For example, Fox Lake, Yukon Territory, was 889-949.",
              "This combination would serve the same purpose as the NANP area code and central office code, with its own latitudinal-longitudinal coordinates, to allow a distance to be calculated for rating of a call.",
              "This coding system, which was in its zenith of usage during the 1980s and 1990s, was rendered unusable when the North American Numbering Plan administrator withdrew the 88X codes for future use as toll free (e.",

              "By the end of the 1990s, very few companies still had need of the Other Place Point codes, and other rating arrangements were made.",
              "For example, Northwestel would use the nearest exchange for calls to its mobile points from other phone companies, and would code the locations in its billing software for calls within the company's operating territory.",
              "The rate impact was negligible for calls over longer distances."

              "Ten years after that groundbreaking call, in 1983, Cooper's prototype handset phone commercially hit the market as the DynaTAC 8000x.",
              "In the decade and a half after that influential product launch, Motorola continued to dramatically innovate in the mobile phone space.",
              "With this anniversary in mind, I thought it would be fun to take a look back at a handful of Motorola's most interesting and innovative cell phones from this \"golden age.\"",
              "Motorola released dozens of mobile phone models during its first 15 years in the cell phone business, so this is only a brief overview.",
              "If you have any memories of classic Motorola cell phones, I would love to read them in the comments.",
              "Advertisement Between Cooper's fateful test call in 1973 and the launch of the DynaTAC 8000x (seen here), Motorola used the time to not only streamline the design of the world's first completely handheld mobile phone, but also to build out the necessary infrastructure (cell towers) that made widespread cell service possible in the first place.",
              "Upon its release in 1983, the DynaTAC 8000X became a cultural icon in films and media as a must-have accessory for the 1980s businessman.",
              "Due to its high price ($3,995 at launch) it also became a status symbol for the wealthy.",
              "The analog DynaTAC landed in a big way, despite a talk time of less than an hour, and Motorola kept refining the DynaTAC series for years to come.",

              "At the time of its release, the MicroTAC was the lightest and smallest cell phone on the market.",
              "Improvements in battery technology and circuit miniaturization cut its general size and weight, and the key innovation of making part of the phone fold up while not in use made it almost perfectly pocketable.",

              "(Photo: Motorola) By the early 1990s, Motorola still produced a line of car phones (like the 2900 seen here), which many people called \"bag phones\" at the time.",
              "The bag contained a transceiver and battery, and the user talked into a much lighter corded handset.",
              "One could carry the bag on one's shoulder, but its bulk mostly limited its use to inside cars.",
              "Even in the 1990s, bag phones remained popular because of their longer talk times and transmission range.",
              "Those features proved important in the days when cellular coverage wasn't nearly as widespread as it is today.",
              "(Photos: Motorola) The 1995 Motorola Flare was one of the firm's first lifestyle phones marketed at average consumers\u2014beyond the usual business customer base.",

              "[6] Although the term \"smartphone\" was not coined until 1995, because of Simon's features and capabilities, it has been retrospectively referred to as the first true smartphone.",
              "[1][7][8][9] BellSouth Cellular Corp.",
              "distributed the IBM Simon in the United States between August 1994 and February 1995, selling 50,000 units.",
              "The Simon Personal Communicator was the first personal digital assistant or PDA to include telephony features (make phone calls).",
              "The battery lasted only an hour, and flip phones became increasingly slim which led to its demise.",
              "[10] With advances in MOSFET (metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor) technology enabling smaller integrated circuit chips be powered[11] and the proliferation of wireless mobile networks,[12][13] IBM engineer Frank Canova realised that chip-and-wireless technology was becoming small enough to use in handheld devices.",
              "[14] IBM debuted a prototype device, code named \"Sweetspot\",[15] on November 16, 1992,[16][17] at the COMDEX[18] computer and technology trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.",
              "The Sweetspot prototype combined a mobile phone and PDA into one device, allowing a user to make and receive telephone calls, facsimiles, emails and cellular pages.",
              "Not only did the prototype have many PDA features including a calendar, address book and notepad, but also demonstrated other digital services such as maps, stocks and news before they were widely available.",
              "COMDEX show attendees and the press showed interest in the device.",
              "The day after Sweetspot's debut, USA Today featured a photo on the front page of the Money section showing Frank Canova, IBM's lead architect and inventor of the smartphone,[19][20] holding the Sweetspot prototype.",
              "[1][21][22] After a very successful prototype demonstration at COMDEX, IBM began work on the commercial product, code named \"Angler\".",
              "[15] The IBM device was manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric, which integrated features from its own wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) and cellular radio technologies while building the IBM device.",
              "IBM initially approached Motorola to manufacture the product, but Motorola rejected the offer, concerned that IBM could become a potential rival mobile manufacturer.",
              "IBM then approached Mitsubishi to build the device.",
              "[6] BellSouth executives gave the finished product its final name, \"Simon Personal Communicator\", before its public debut at the Wireless World Conference in November 1993.",
              "[1] BellSouth Cellular had planned to begin selling Simon in May 1994, but due to problems with the device's software, the Simon did not become available to consumers until August 16, 1994.",
              "BellSouth Cellular initially offered the Simon throughout its 15-state service area for US$899 with a two-year service contract or US$1099 without a contract.",
              "Later in the product's life, BellSouth Cellular reduced the price to US$599 with a two-year contract.",
              "[2][23] BellSouth Cellular sold approximately 50,000 units during the product's six months on the market.",
              "[1] In addition to its ability to make and receive cellular phone calls, Simon was also able to send and receive faxes, e-mails and cellular pages.",
              "Simon featured many applications, including an address book, calendar, appointment scheduler, calculator, world time clock, electronic notepad, handwritten annotations, and standard and predictive stylus input screen keyboards.",
              "[24] It features a liquid-crystal display (LCD) and has PC Card support.",
              "[25] Its internal hardware includes the Vadem VG230 (CMOS) system-on-a-chip (SoC) from NEC, MOS random-access memory (RAM) chips from Sony and Hitachi, flash memory (floating-gate MOS) chips from Intel and Hitachi, and Cirrus Logic modem chips.",
              "[5] Each Simon was shipped with a charging base station, a nickel-cadmium battery,[2] and a protective leather cover.",
              "Optional was a PCMCIA pager card designed by Motorola, an RS-232 adapter cable for use with PC-Link to access files from a personal computer,[citation needed] and an RJ11 adapter cable to allow voice and data calls to be made over POTS land-lines.",
              "The RJ11 adapter helped users reduce expensive cellular phone bills or make calls where cellular coverage didn't exist in 1994.",
              "[2] The Simon used the file system from Datalight ROM-DOS along with file compression from Stacker.",
              "IBM created a unique touch-screen user interface for Simon;",

              "It was code-named \u201cAngler\u201d and was unveiled at the fall COMDEX convention in Vegas, but wouldn\u2019t be available to purchase by consumers until August 16, 1994.",
              "In 1995, the great Computer Chronicles TV show led its \u201cYear of the Portable\u201d episode with Simon.",
              "Here\u2019s the brief segment: \u201cI am totally computer-functional!",
              "\u201d The phone had no web browser \u2014 heck, computers were just getting decent browsers back then \u2014 but email access was a big selling point.",
              "It could send faxes, too, which is a technology people haven\u2019t been able to completely kill off yet despite decades of trying.",
              "By today\u2019s standards, of course, Simon was clunky and outrageously priced.",
              "But for a do-it-all gizmo in the mid-\u201990s, its $1,100 price tag should elicit a mere shrug from most of us nowadays.",
              "And if you signed a two-year contract with BellSouth, you could get it for $900;",
              "that subsidized price eventually dropped to $600.",
              "The phone itself measured 8 inches long by 2.",
              "5 inches wide by 1.",
              "5 inches thick, and weighed two ounces north of a pound.",
              "That\u2019d be pretty clunky today, but we\u2019re talking about the \u201990s here.",
              "Everyone was wearing Hammer pants and Zubaz, so pocket space wasn\u2019t much of an issue, right?",
              "As you can see in the above photo \u2014 where it\u2019s placed next to an iPhone 4S \u2014 it\u2019s big but not monstrous.",
              "Touchscreens weren\u2019t exactly nonexistent back in the early \u201990s, but they weren\u2019t super common, either.",
              "Simon is believed to be the first commercially available phone with a touchscreen, though earlier PDA devices had showcased various portable touchscreen technologies.",
              "Simon\u2019s interface could be navigated with an included stylus, and somewhat less easily with a finger.",

              "\u201d That parting jab at Android was uncalled for, fellas.",
              "There was no app store, of course, but the phone came preloaded with several apps.",
              "You can take a look at Simon\u2019s user manual, which is not only chock full of wonderfully nostalgic technobabble from back in the day, but also lists the following apps: These things weren\u2019t called \u201capps\u201d back then.",
              "They were generally referred to as \u201cfeatures\u201d found in the \u201cMobile Office\u201d section of the phone.",
              "Here\u2019s a look at the alarm clock: Email was no picnic to set up, either.",
              "It used Lotus\u2019 cc:Mail offering, which required you to dial in to a computer running cc:Mail software that housed all your messages \u2014 the \u201cpost office,\u201d as it were.",
              "How would you set up this post office?",
              "You wouldn\u2019t: According to Simon\u2019s manual, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about how to set up a post office, because your E-mail administrator or service does that.",
              "\u201d The feature was called the \u201cPredictaKey\u201d keyboard and, according to the user manual, \u201calways shows the six most-likely letters that you need, depending on the characters you\u2019ve just typed.",
              "An early profile of Simon alludes to a BellSouth-Apple partnership for Apple\u2019s Newton PDA wherein BellSouth was \u201cworking with Apple to integrate cellular into the device.",
              "\u201d The piece quoted BellSouth\u2019s then-product-manager Rich Guidotti assuaging concerns that the two devices would compete: BellSouth\u2019s work with Apple is not affected by the new Simon, Guidotti said.",
              "Referring to the Newton as an electronic organizer and the Simon as a personal communicator, Guidotti added: \u201cNo one product fits everyone\u2019s needs.",
              "\u201d A cellular connection for the Newton wouldn\u2019t materialize from the BellSouth-Apple partnership, however.",
              "Built-in cellular features for the Newton were apparently nixed altogether.",
              "The movie, according to Frank Costanza, is \u201ccalled The Net, with that girl from The Bus.",
              "\u201d Though Simon was targeted at deep-pocketed business people, cell service was still spotty and expensive back in the mid-\u201990s.",
              "An optional cable allowed Simon\u2019s owner to plug it into a standard phone jack (remember those?)",
              "to make calls via more reliable and less expensive land-line systems. Despite its features, IBM and BellSouth didn\u2019t exactly have a hit on their hands.",
              "Simon spent a mere six months on the market, with around 50,000 units sold.",
              "Businessweek\u2019s profile of the device cites Simon\u2019s weak battery \u2014 it lasted around an hour \u2014 and the cool factor of svelter and svelter flip phones as contributing to Simon\u2019s demise.",

              "Jobs' fury around Google and its smartphone software is well documented, and the many lawsuits involving Apple and various Android partners showed that Jobs was serious about his allegations of theft.",
              "But the reality is that both Apple and Google have taken inspiration from each other for years and that neither company would be where it is today without the work of the other.",
              "So as Android celebrates its 15th birthday (since the launch of the first Android-based phone, the T-Mobile G1), let's take a look back at the journey the companies have taken to becoming the most dominant forces in the tech world -- and how their competition pushed them to innovate.",
              "The T-Mobile G1, back in 2008.",
              "Smartphones have arguably changed the world more than any other invention in human history, from radically altering how we interact with one another to creating a whole new category of companies that deal in various mobile technologies.",
              "And though Jobs may have been outspokenly vitriolic about Android in the early days, it's clear that ideas and inspiration have echoed back and forth between Apple and Google in the years since.",
              "The last 15 years of competition between the two companies have often felt like siblings bickering at playtime, falling out over who had which toy first or crying to the parents when the other one took something that wasn't theirs.",
              "Most siblings will argue to some extent throughout their lives, but history is also rife with pairings that, through spirited competition, pushed each sibling to succeed.",

              "But though the relationship today between the iPhone maker and the Android purveyor hardly matches the Williams' friendly, familial rivalry, that wasn't always the case.",

              "One, a Blackberry-esque phone that made use of hardware buttons and scroll wheels, had been in the prototype phase for some time.",
              "The more recent prototype was dominated by a large touchscreen and appeared to be much more like the iPhone.",
              "That didn't go down well with Jobs, who threatened the destruction of Android using \"every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank.\"",
              "The first Android phone, the T-Mobile G1, combined elements of both those prototypes, with a touchscreen that slid out to reveal a physical keyboard.",
              "Schmidt left Apple's board of directors in 2009 due to potential conflicts of interest, and so began a series of lawsuits involving Apple and various Google partners over alleged infringement of phone-related patents.",
              "The most notable of the Google partners was Samsung, which Apple accused of infringing a number of patents, including patents related to basic functions like tap to zoom and slide to unlock.",
              "These legal battles raged for years, with Apple claiming that \"it is a fact that Samsung blatantly copied our design\" and Samsung pushing back.",
              "The long dispute finally came to an end in 2018, when both sides agreed to settle out of court.",
              "Despite the competing claims made during those long courtroom struggles, if we look at the development not just of the software but of the phones that run it, it seems clear both sides continued to liberally borrow ideas from each other.",
              "Samsung's Galaxy S, launched in June 2010 Features like picture-in-picture, live voicemail, lock screen customization and live translation were all found on the Android operating system before eventually making their way to iOS.",
              "And though the use of widgets to customize your home screen was long held as a differentiator for Android, that feature too eventually found its way to iOS.",
              "On the other hand, Android's Nearby Share feature is remarkably similar to Apple's AirDrop, and Android phones didn't get features like \"do not disturb\" or the ability to take screenshots until some time after the iPhone had them.",

              "Still, Google itself went on to ditch the headphone jack, with the Pixel 2.",
              "Google's Pixel 2 followed the iPhone's lead in removing the headphone jack.",
              "Sometimes it's difficult, if not impossible, to say whether these companies are copying each other's ideas or simply coming up with the same conclusions after paying attention to consumer trends, rumors in the press and the general evolution of supporting technologies.",
              "Rumors that Apple would remove the physical home button on the iPhone X were circling long before the phone was officially unveiled in September 2017.",
              "Are they the same rumors Samsung responded to when it \"beat Apple to the punch\" and removed the home button from its Galaxy S8 earlier that same year?",
              "Or did both sides simply arrive at such a big design decision independently?",
              "It's impossible to pick a side in this argument -- and somewhat reductive to even try.",
              "And regardless, you wind up with the same thing: Phones and software from different manufacturers that seem to evolve in unison.",

              "4% (according to information from Statista).",
              "But Google's focus has always been on getting the Android operating system onto as many devices as possible, from phones costing less than $50 to those costing over $1,500.",
              "Apple, meanwhile, offers iOS only on its own devices, and those devices come at a hefty premium, so it's fair to expect that iOS won't be as widespread.",
              "Android is found on a huge variety of devices, at all prices.",
              "Google's business model is primarily one of a service provider, though, and not a hardware manufacturer.",
              "It makes its money chiefly from selling advertisements across all its platforms, and so it typically benefits from a mass market approach.",
              "Android itself is free for companies to use -- hence the large number of installs.",
              "But to use Google services (Gmail, YouTube, Chrome and so on, along with access to the Google Play Store) companies must pay license fees to Google.",
              "Still, the free use of Android is why you'll find the operating system on phones from Samsung, Motorola, OnePlus, Oppo, Nothing and a huge variety of other brands -- and yes, on Google's own Pixel phones.",
              "Apple, however, is a closed shop.",
              "Only iPhones can run iOS, and Apple has every intention of keeping it that way.",
              "It has full control over how that software works on its phones (and charges developers accordingly for apps sold in its own App Store) and how it can be best optimized for the hardware.",
              "That's why Apple phones typically perform better than many high-end Android phones, despite the hardware often being less high-spec on paper.",
              "Android by its nature has to take more of a \"one size fits all\" approach, where each new version has to run well on a huge variety of devices, with different screen sizes and under-the-hood components.",
              "Android struggled with the arrival of tablets, as software designed for 4-inch phones suddenly had to stretch to fit screens much larger in size.",
              "Android 3.",
              "0 Honeycomb was primarily designed for tablets, but various issues meant it didn't hang around for long, and some of its features were simply absorbed into future versions.",
              "Apple takes a different approach: Though at first it used iOS for both devices, now it keeps iOS solely for its phones, optimizing for the smaller screen sizes, with the newer iPadOS as the software for its tablets.",
              "The Pixel 7 Pro offers one of the best Android experiences around.",
              "Yet it's still clear to see the ways the two operating systems have converged over the years.",
              "Though Android was always the more customizable of the two, Apple eventually introduced home-screen widgets, customizable lock screens and even the ability to create icon themes to transform the look of your device.",
              "Meanwhile, Google worked hard to limit the problems caused by fragmentation and has arguably taken more of an \"Apple\" approach in its own line of devices.",
              "Like Apple's iPhones, the phones in the more recent Pixel range -- including the excellent Pixel 7 Pro -- were designed to show off \"the best of Google,\" with processors produced in house (as Apple does with the chips for its iPhones) and software optimized for the Pixel phone it'll run on.",
              "Though Android may be ahead in terms of numbers of users, Google has clearly seen that Apple is leading the way in terms of a more premium, refined hardware experience, and the Pixel series is Google's answer.",
              "Having reviewed both the Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 7 Pro myself, I can say with certainty that they're the most Apple-like experience you can get from an Android phone.",
              "\"We are at an interesting crossroads for Android,\" says Ben Woods, industry analyst at CCS Insight.",
              "\"Although its success in volume terms is undisputed, it is increasingly losing share to Apple in the premium smartphone space.\"",
              "Google's Pixel phones are some of the best Android phones around, but sales of the devices are a fraction of what Apple sees with the iPhone.",
              "Samsung's phone range includes budget models through to futuristic and high-priced folding designs.",
              "It's a different story when you look at Android partners, chiefly Samsung, which is jostling with Apple for the position of No.",
              "1 phone manufacturer in the world -- a title that seems to frequently slip from one of the companies to the other.",
              "But Samsung has a much wider catalog of products, with unit sales being bolstered by a larger number of phones at lower price points.",
              "In the premium segment, Apple still rules, and that's showing no sign of slowing down.",
              "But Android is increasingly betting on longer-term success from its innovation with foldable phones.",
              "Samsung is now multiple generations into its Galaxy Z Flip and Z Fold devices, with Google's own Pixel Fold joining the party earlier this year, along with foldables from the likes of Oppo, Motorola and soon OnePlus.",
              "Apple has yet to launch a foldable device, and it remains to be seen whether that's simply because its take on the genre isn't ready, or because it believes foldables are a fad that'll pass (like 3D displays or curving designs).",
              "The iPhone 15 Pro isn't a huge departure from previous models, but it offers a big range of refinements.",
              "Rather than looking toward more-experimental innovations like foldable displays, Apple has instead continued to refine its existing hardware, equipping its latest iPhone 15 Pro series with titanium designs and improved cameras.",
              "And Apple's approach also includes pulling people into the wider Apple ecosystem, with iPhones syncing seamlessly with other Apple products, including Apple Watches, iPads, Macs, HomePods and Apple TV.",
              "With each new iPhone customer comes an opportunity for Apple to sell additional products from its own catalog, along with services like iCloud storage, Apple Music, Apple Fitness or subscriptions to its Apple TV streaming service.",
              "Though Google offers products like this to some extent, it has yet to offer the sort of cohesive package Apple does, which could make Google's offerings less enticing for new customers and tempt Android users to jump ship to Apple.",
              "Still, Android's proliferation across devices at lower price points will continue to make it a popular choice for people on tighter budgets.",
              "And its presence on a huge number of devices from third-party manufacturers means it's where we'll see more innovation that seeks to answer the question of what role the smartphone plays in our lives.",
              "Apple's iPhone 15 launch event featured a lot of sustainability improvements.",
              "Other companies, like Fairphone, already use repairability and recycled materials as key selling points.",
              "With smartphone shipments expected to hit their lowest point in a decade, more companies will be looking for ways to use new, exciting technologies to capture an audience's attention and present a product that serves up new ways of doing things.",
              "We'll see this from Android and its partners and from Apple with the iPhone, its software and its peripheral devices, including new tech like Apple's Vision Pro headset.",
              "We'll also see a bigger focus from all sides on sustainability: Apple, for instance, went to great lengths during its iPhone 15 launch event in September to flex its green credentials.",
              "While Samsung is making larger efforts in sustainability and smaller companies like Fairphone are using planet-friendly features as primary selling points, other manufacturers have yet to make sustainability a key part of their business model.",
              "It's likely, then, that as consumers increasingly look toward sustainable options, the next major competition in the smartphone industry could be who can make the greenest product.",
              "There's no question that the development of both the software and hardware side of iOS and Android smartphones has at times happened almost in tandem, with one side launching a feature and the other responding in \"me too!\"",
