    "query": "What is the process and criteria for selecting the winners of the Pulitzer Prize, and how has this evolved over time since its inception in 1917?",
    "response": "The Pulitzer Prize is an award for achievements in newspaper, magazine and online journalism, literature, and musical composition in the United States[^5^]. It was established in 1917 by provisions in the will of American (Hungarian-born) Joseph Pulitzer who had made his fortune as a newspaper publisher[^5^].\n\nTo enter the Pulitzer Prize, one has to fill out an application, pay an entry fee of around $75 and send four copies of the book to the committee overseeing the awards[^4^]. The author, the publisher or a fan can send it[^4^]. Entries must fit in at least one of the specific prize categories, and cannot simply gain entrance for being literary or musical[^5^].\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize Board appoints juries to select the best works among the entries in each category. The juries usually consist of three to five members who are experts in their fields[^3^]. The juries nominate three finalists in each category and send their recommendations to the Pulitzer Prize Board[^3^]. The Board then votes on the final winners with a majority vote deciding who the winner is[^1^].\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has evolved over time since its inception in 1917. Some of the changes include:\n\n- Adding new categories such as photography, criticism, editorial cartooning, feature writing, commentary, biography, history, poetry, music and drama[^5^].\n- Changing the names and definitions of some categories such as public service, investigative reporting, explanatory reporting, national reporting, international reporting and breaking news reporting[^5^].\n- Allowing online-only publications to enter some categories since 2009[^2^].\n- Allowing magazines and magazine websites to enter some categories since 2016[^2^].\n- Allowing books that are self-published or published by non-traditional publishers to enter some categories since 2017[^2^].\n\nI hope this answers your question.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "It was established in 1917 by provisions in the will of Joseph Pulitzer, who had made his fortune as a newspaper publisher.",
              "[2] As of 2023, prizes are awarded annually in twenty-three categories.",
              "[3] In twenty-two of the categories, each winner receives a certificate and a US$15,000 cash award (raised from $10,000 in 2017).",
              "[4] The winner in the public service category is awarded a gold medal.",
