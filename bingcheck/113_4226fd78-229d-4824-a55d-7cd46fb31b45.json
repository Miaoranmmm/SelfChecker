              "S.",
              "Navy in World War II, he completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering at Oregon State University in 1948.",
              "He soon became dissatisfied with his electrical engineering job at the Ames Research Center, located at Moffett Field, California, and in December 1950 had the inspiration that would drive the rest of his professional life.",
              "Engelbart\u2019s dream was to use computers to connect individuals in a network that would allow them to share and update information in \u201creal time.",
              "\u201d He combined this idea of collaborative software, or groupware, with his experience interpreting radar displays and with ideas he gleaned from an Atlantic Monthly article by Vannevar Bush, \u201cAs We May Think,\u201d to envision networked computers employing a graphical user interface.",
              "After receiving a doctorate in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1955, he stayed on as an acting assistant professor for a year before accepting a position with the Stanford Research Institute (SRI;",
              "now SRI International) in Menlo Park, California.",
              "In 1963 SRI partially funded Engelbart\u2019s own research laboratory, the Augmentation Research Center, where he worked on inventing and perfecting various devices for inputting, manipulating, and displaying data\u2014such as the computer mouse, the multiple-window display, and hypermedia (the linking of texts, images, video, and sound files within a single document).",
              "Together with a colleague at SRI, William English, he eventually perfected a variety of input devices that became common\u2014including joysticks, light pens, and track balls.",
              "Prior to Engelbart\u2019s inventions, laborious and error-prone keypunch cards or manually set electronic switches were necessary to control computers, and data had to be printed before it could be viewed.",
              "His work made it possible for ordinary people to use computers.",
              "Early in 1967 Engelbart\u2019s laboratory became the second site on the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the primary precursor to the Internet.",
              "At a computer conference in San Francisco on December 9, 1968, Engelbart demonstrated a working real-time collaborative computer system known as NLS (oN-Line System).",
              "Using NLS, he and a colleague (back in Menlo Park) worked on a shared document in one window (using keyboard and mouse input devices) while at the same time conducting the world\u2019s first public computer video conference in another window.",
              "Engelbart continued his research, building increasingly sophisticated input and display devices and improving the graphical user interface, but because of budget cuts at SRI most of his research staff migrated to other institutions such as Xerox Corporation\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center in Palo Alto, California.",
              "In 1977 SRI sold Engelbart\u2019s NLS groupware system to Tymshare, Incorporated, a telephone networking company that renamed it Augment and sought to make it into a commercially viable office automation system.",
              "Engelbart was the last remaining member of his research laboratory, and SRI showed no further interest in his work, so he joined Tymshare.",
              "In 1984 Tymshare was acquired by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, where Engelbart worked on information systems. In 1989 he founded the Bootstrap Institute, a research and consulting firm.",
              "Over the following decade he finally began to receive recognition for his innovations."

              "1c Although many impressive innovations for interacting with computers have followed in the last 50 years since its invention, the mouse remains to this day the most efficient hands on pointing device available for speed and accuracy.",
              "11dc The basic idea for the mouse first came to him in 1961 while sitting in a conference session on computer graphics, his mind mulling over the challenge of making interactive computing more efficient.",
              "It occurred to him that, using a pair of small wheels traversing a tabletop, one wheel turning horizontally, one turning vertically, the computer could track their combined rotations and move the cursor on the display accordingly.",

              "\u2013 but in this case, rolling the wheels around on the tabletop would plot the x,y coordinates for a cursor on a computer screen.",

In 1962 he published his findings in \"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework,\" which in 1963 garnered him some modest funding from ARPA to begin to hire a very small research team, and set up a basic lab with computer resources, teletypes, and finally, a display workstation.",

              "[29] Engelbart's original cursor was displayed as an arrow pointing upward, but was slanted to the left upon its deployment in the XEROX PARC machine to better distinguish between on-screen text and the cursor in the machine's low-resolution interface.",
              "[30] The now-familiar cursor arrow is characterized by a vertical left side and a 45-degree angle on the right.",
              "He never received any royalties for the invention of the mouse.",
              "During an interview, he said, \"SRI patented the mouse, but they really had no idea of its value.",
              "Some years later it was learned that they had licensed it to Apple Computer for something like $40,000.\"",
              "[31] Engelbart showcased the chorded keyboard and many more of his and ARC's inventions in 1968 at The Mother of All Demos.",
              "[32][33] Engelbart slipped into relative obscurity by the mid-1970s.",
              "As early as 1970, several of his researchers became alienated from him and left his organization for Xerox PARC, in part due to frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing.",
              "[1] Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer.",
              "The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.",
              "[1][15] Beginning in 1972, several key ARC personnel were involved in Erhard Seminars Training (EST), with Engelbart ultimately serving on the corporation's board of directors for many years.",
              "Although EST had been recommended by other researchers, the controversial nature of EST and other social experiments reduced the morale and social cohesion of the ARC community.",
              "[34] The 1969 Mansfield Amendment, which ended military funding of non-military research, the end of the Vietnam War, and the end of the Apollo program gradually reduced ARC's funding from ARPA and NASA throughout the early 1970s.",
              "SRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of artificial intelligence researcher Bertram Raphael, who negotiated the transfer of the laboratory to Tymshare in 1976.",
              "Engelbart's house in Atherton, California burned down during this period, causing him and his family further problems. Tymshare took over NLS and the lab that Engelbart had founded, hired most of the lab's staff (including its creator as a Senior Scientist), renamed the software Augment, and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division.",
              "Tymshare was already somewhat familiar with NLS;",
              "when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with its own local copy of the NLS software on a minicomputer called OFFICE-1, as part of a joint project with ARC.",
              "[15] At Tymshare, Engelbart soon found himself further marginalized.",
              "Operational concerns at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's desire to conduct ongoing research.",
              "Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at McDonnell Douglas, which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them.",
              "His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas was focused on the enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system.",
              "[35] Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure.",
              "[1][15] Teaming with his daughter, Christina Engelbart, he founded the Bootstrap Institute in 1988 to coalesce his ideas into a series of three-day and half-day management seminars offered at Stanford University from 1989 to 2000.",
              "[15] By the early 1990s there was sufficient interest among his seminar graduates to launch a collaborative implementation of his work, and the Bootstrap Alliance was formed as a non-profit home base for this effort.",
              "Although the invasion of Iraq and subsequent recession spawned a rash of belt-tightening reorganizations which drastically redirected the efforts of their alliance partners, they continued with the management seminars, consulting, and small-scale collaborations.",
              "In the mid-1990s they were awarded some DARPA funding to develop a modern user interface to Augment, called Visual AugTerm (VAT),[36] while participating in a larger program addressing the IT requirements of the Joint Task Force.",

              "[34] Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf.",
              "Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies.",
              "He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.",

In 1962 he published his findings in \"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework,\" which in 1963 garnered him some modest funding from ARPA to begin to hire a very small research team, and set up a basic lab with computer resources, teletypes, and finally, a display workstation.",

When pondering the question of pointing devices in 1961, he was in the midst of an in-depth study of how teams and organizations might become much more effective in solving important problems. In 1962 he published his findings in \"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework,\" which in 1963 garnered him some modest funding from ARPA to begin to hire a very small research team, and set up a basic lab with computer resources, teletypes, and finally, a display workstation.",

              "He is best known for his work on founding the field of human\u2013computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International, which resulted in creation of the computer mouse, and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces.",
              "These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968.",
              "Engelbart's law, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.",
              "NLS, the \"oN-Line System\", developed by the Augmentation Research Center under Engelbart's guidance with funding primarily from ARPA (as DARPA was then known), demonstrated numerous technologies, most of which are now in widespread use;",

              "The lab was transferred from SRI to Tymshare in the late 1970s, which was acquired by McDonnell Douglas in 1984, and NLS was renamed Augment (now the Doug Engelbart Institute).",
              "[6] At both Tymshare and McDonnell Douglas, Engelbart was limited by a lack of interest in his ideas and funding to pursue them and retired in 1986.",

              "His ancestors were of German, Swedish and Norwegian descent.",
              "[7] He was the middle of three children, with a sister Dorianne (three years older), and a brother David (14 months younger).",
              "The family lived in Portland, Oregon, in his early years, and moved to the surrounding countryside along Johnson Creek when he was 8.",
              "His father died one year later.",
              "He graduated from Portland's Franklin High School in 1942.",
              "[8] Midway through his undergraduate years at Oregon State University, he served two years in the United States Navy as a radio and radar technician in the Philippines.",
              "[8] It was there, on the remote island of Leyte in a small traditional hut on stilts, that he read Vannevar Bush's article \"As We May Think\", which would have a large influence on his thinking and work.",
              "[9] He returned to Oregon State and completed his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1948.",
              "While at Oregon State, he was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon social fraternity.",
              "[10][11] He was hired by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at the Ames Research Center, where he worked in wind tunnel maintenance.",
              "In his off hours he enjoyed hiking, camping, and folk dancing.",
              "It was there he met Ballard Fish (August 18, 1928 \u2013 June 18, 1997),[12] who was just completing her training to become an occupational therapist.",
              "They were married in Portola State Park on May 5, 1951.",
              "Soon after, Engelbart left Ames to pursue graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley.",
              "At Berkeley, he studied electrical engineering with a specialty in computers, earning his MS in 1953 and his PhD in 1955.",
              "[13] Engelbart's career was inspired in December 1950 when he was engaged to be married and realized he had no career goals other than \"a steady job, getting married and living happily ever after\".",
              "[15] Over several months he reasoned that: In 1945, Engelbart had read with interest Vannevar Bush's article \"As We May Think\",[17] a call to action for making knowledge widely available as a national peacetime grand challenge.",
              "He had also read something about the recent phenomenon of computers, and from his experience as a radar technician, he knew that information could be analyzed and displayed on a screen.",
              "He envisioned intellectual workers sitting at display \"working stations\", flying through information space, harnessing their collective intellectual capacity to solve important problems together in much more powerful ways.",
              "Harnessing collective intellect, facilitated by interactive computers, became his life's mission at a time when computers were viewed as number crunching tools.",
              "[18] As a graduate student at Berkeley, he assisted in the construction of CALDIC.",
              "His graduate work led to eight patents.",
              "[19] After completing his doctorate, Engelbart stayed on at Berkeley as an assistant professor for a year before departing when it became clear that he could not pursue his vision there.",
              "Engelbart then formed a startup company, Digital Techniques, to commercialize some of his doctoral research on storage devices, but after a year decided instead to pursue the research he had been dreaming of since 1951.",
              "[20] Engelbart took a position at SRI International (known then as Stanford Research Institute) in Menlo Park, California in 1957.",
              "He worked for Hewitt Crane on magnetic devices and miniaturization of electronics;",
              "Engelbart and Crane became close friends.",
              "[21] At SRI, Engelbart soon obtained a dozen patents,[19] and by 1962 produced a report about his vision and proposed research agenda titled Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework.",
              "[18] Among other highlights, this paper introduced \"Building Information Modelling\", which architectural and engineering practice eventually adopted (first as \"parametric design\") in the 1990s and after.",
              "[22] This led to funding from ARPA to launch his work.",
              "Engelbart recruited a research team in his new Augmentation Research Center (ARC, the lab he founded at SRI).",
              "Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed \"bootstrapping strategy\".",
              "He designed the strategy to accelerate the rate of innovation of his lab.",
              "[23][24][25] The ARC became the driving force behind the design and development of the oN-Line System (NLS).",
              "He and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface.",
              "[26] He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems. Engelbart applied for a patent in 1967 and received it in 1970, for the wooden shell with two metal wheels (computer mouse \u2013 U.",
              "S.",
              "Patent 3,541,541), which he had developed with Bill English, his lead engineer, sometime before 1965.",
              "[27][28] In the patent application it is described as an \"X-Y position indicator for a display system\".",
              "Engelbart later revealed that it was nicknamed the \"mouse\" because the tail came out the end.",
              "His group also called the on-screen Cursor a \"bug\", but this term was not widely adopted.",
              "[29] Engelbart's original cursor was displayed as an arrow pointing upward, but was slanted to the left upon its deployment in the XEROX PARC machine to better distinguish between on-screen text and the cursor in the machine's low-resolution interface.",
              "[30] The now-familiar cursor arrow is characterized by a vertical left side and a 45-degree angle on the right.",
              "He never received any royalties for the invention of the mouse.",
              "During an interview, he said, \"SRI patented the mouse, but they really had no idea of its value.",
              "Some years later it was learned that they had licensed it to Apple Computer for something like $40,000.\"",
              "[31] Engelbart showcased the chorded keyboard and many more of his and ARC's inventions in 1968 at The Mother of All Demos.",
              "[32][33] Engelbart slipped into relative obscurity by the mid-1970s.",
              "As early as 1970, several of his researchers became alienated from him and left his organization for Xerox PARC, in part due to frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing.",
              "[1] Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer.",
              "The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.",
              "[1][15] Beginning in 1972, several key ARC personnel were involved in Erhard Seminars Training (EST), with Engelbart ultimately serving on the corporation's board of directors for many years.",
              "Although EST had been recommended by other researchers, the controversial nature of EST and other social experiments reduced the morale and social cohesion of the ARC community.",
              "[34] The 1969 Mansfield Amendment, which ended military funding of non-military research, the end of the Vietnam War, and the end of the Apollo program gradually reduced ARC's funding from ARPA and NASA throughout the early 1970s.",
              "SRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of artificial intelligence researcher Bertram Raphael, who negotiated the transfer of the laboratory to Tymshare in 1976.",
              "Engelbart's house in Atherton, California burned down during this period, causing him and his family further problems. Tymshare took over NLS and the lab that Engelbart had founded, hired most of the lab's staff (including its creator as a Senior Scientist), renamed the software Augment, and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division.",
              "Tymshare was already somewhat familiar with NLS;",
              "when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with its own local copy of the NLS software on a minicomputer called OFFICE-1, as part of a joint project with ARC.",
              "[15] At Tymshare, Engelbart soon found himself further marginalized.",
              "Operational concerns at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's desire to conduct ongoing research.",
              "Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at McDonnell Douglas, which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them.",
              "His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas was focused on the enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system.",
              "[35] Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure.",
              "[1][15] Teaming with his daughter, Christina Engelbart, he founded the Bootstrap Institute in 1988 to coalesce his ideas into a series of three-day and half-day management seminars offered at Stanford University from 1989 to 2000.",
              "[15] By the early 1990s there was sufficient interest among his seminar graduates to launch a collaborative implementation of his work, and the Bootstrap Alliance was formed as a non-profit home base for this effort.",
              "Although the invasion of Iraq and subsequent recession spawned a rash of belt-tightening reorganizations which drastically redirected the efforts of their alliance partners, they continued with the management seminars, consulting, and small-scale collaborations.",
              "In the mid-1990s they were awarded some DARPA funding to develop a modern user interface to Augment, called Visual AugTerm (VAT),[36] while participating in a larger program addressing the IT requirements of the Joint Task Force.",
              "Engelbart was Founder Emeritus of the Doug Engelbart Institute, which he founded in 1988 with his daughter Christina Engelbart, who is Executive Director.",
              "The Institute promotes Engelbart's philosophy for boosting Collective IQ\u2014the concept of dramatically improving how we can solve important problems together\u2014using a strategic bootstrapping approach for accelerating our progress toward that goal.",
              "[37] In 2005, Engelbart received a National Science Foundation grant to fund the open source HyperScope project.",
              "[38] The Hyperscope team built a browser component using Ajax and Dynamic HTML designed to replicate Augment's multiple viewing and jumping capabilities (linking within and across various documents).",
              "[39] Engelbart attended the Program for the Future 2010 Conference where hundreds of people convened at The Tech Museum in San Jose and online to engage in dialog about how to pursue his vision to augment collective intelligence.",
              "[40] The most complete coverage of Engelbart's bootstrapping ideas can be found in Boosting Our Collective IQ, by Douglas C.",
              "Engelbart, 1995.",
              "[41] This includes three of Engelbart's key papers, edited into book form by Yuri Rubinsky and Christina Engelbart to commemorate the presentation of the 1995 SoftQuad Web Award to Doug Engelbart at the World Wide Web conference in Boston in December 1995.",
              "Only 2,000 softcover copies were printed, and 100 hardcover, numbered and signed by Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee.",

              "[42] Two comprehensive histories of Engelbart's laboratory and work are in What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry by John Markoff and A Heritage of Innovation: SRI's First Half Century by Donald Neilson.",
              "[43] Other books on Engelbart and his laboratory include Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing by Thierry Bardini and The Engelbart Hypothesis: Dialogs with Douglas Engelbart, by Valerie Landau and Eileen Clegg in conversation with Douglas Engelbart.",
              "[44] All four of these books are based on interviews with Engelbart as well as other contributors in his laboratory.",
              "Engelbart served on the Advisory Boards of the University of Santa Clara Center for Science, Technology, and Society, Foresight Institute,[45] Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, The Technology Center of Silicon Valley, and The Liquid Information Company.",
              "[46] Engelbart had four children, Gerda, Diana, Christina and Norman with his first wife Ballard, who died in 1997 after 47 years of marriage.",
              "He remarried on January 26, 2008, to writer and producer Karen O'Leary Engelbart.",

              "[20][53] Engelbart was 88 and was survived by his second wife, the four children from his first marriage, and nine grandchildren.",
              "[53] Historian of science Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex personal philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern application of the concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology.",
              "[34] Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf.",
              "Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies.",
              "He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.",
              "[34] Since the late 1980s, prominent individuals and organizations have recognized the seminal importance of Engelbart's contributions.",
              "[54] In December 1995, at the Fourth WWW Conference in Boston, he was the first recipient of what would later become the Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award.",
              "In 1997, he was awarded the Lemelson-MIT Prize of $500,000, the world's largest single prize for invention and innovation, and the ACM Turing Award.",
              "[1] To mark the 30th anniversary of Engelbart's 1968 demo, in 1998 the Stanford Silicon Valley Archives and the Institute for the Future hosted Engelbart's Unfinished Revolution, a symposium at Stanford University's Memorial Auditorium, to honor Engelbart and his ideas.",
              "[55] He was inducted into National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1998.",
              "[56] Engelbart was awarded the Stibitz-Wilson Award from the American Computer & Robotics Museum in 1998.",
              "[57] Also in 1998, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) SIGCHI awarded Engelbart the CHI Lifetime Achievement Award.",
              "[58] ACM SIGCHI later inducted Engelbart into the CHI Academy in 2002.",

              "The first prototype \u2013 a one-button mouse in a wooden shell on wheels \u2013 was built in 1964 to test the concept.",

              "Based on results of his landmark study on 'Augmenting the Human Intellect,' Engelbart had received modest funding to evaluate the speed and efficiency of various devices for pointing on a display screen, like the joy stick, including a few his team rigged up and threw into the mix, like the one they called a \"mouse.\"",
              "Which pointing device scored the highest?",

              "1c Although many impressive innovations for interacting with computers have followed in the last 50 years since its invention, the mouse remains to this day the most efficient hands on pointing device available for speed and accuracy.",
              "11dc The basic idea for the mouse first came to him in 1961 while sitting in a conference session on computer graphics, his mind mulling over the challenge of making interactive computing more efficient.",
              "It occurred to him that, using a pair of small wheels traversing a tabletop, one wheel turning horizontally, one turning vertically, the computer could track their combined rotations and move the cursor on the display accordingly.",
              "The wheels could function something like the wheels on a planimeter \u2013 a tool used by engineers and geographers to measure areas on a map, blueprint, drawing, etc.",
              "\u2013 but in this case, rolling the wheels around on the tabletop would plot the x,y coordinates for a cursor on a computer screen.",
              "He recorded the idea in his notebook for future reference.",
              "Since 1951 Doug had envisioned intellectual workers sitting at high-performance interactive display workstations, accessing a vast online information space in which to collaborate on important problems. When pondering the question of pointing devices in 1961, he was in the midst of an in-depth study of how teams and organizations might become much more effective in solving important problems. In 1962 he published his findings in \"Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework,\" which in 1963 garnered him some modest funding from ARPA to begin to hire a very small research team, and set up a basic lab with computer resources, teletypes, and finally, a display workstation.",

              "[1] The live demonstration featured the introduction of a complete computer hardware and software system called the oN-Line System or, more commonly, NLS.",
              "The 90-minute presentation demonstrated for the first time many of the fundamental elements of modern personal computing: windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking, revision control, and a collaborative real-time editor.",
              "Engelbart's presentation was the first to publicly demonstrate all of these elements in a single system.",
              "The demonstration was highly influential and spawned similar projects at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s.",
              "The underlying concepts and technologies influenced both the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows graphical user interface operating systems in the 1980s and 1990s.",
              "Much of Engelbart's thought that led to the development of his Augmentation Research Center (ARC), as well as the oN-Line System, was derived from the \"research culture\" of World War II and the early Cold War.",
              "A notable source of inspiration to Engelbart was the article \"As We May Think\", written by Vannevar Bush in The Atlantic magazine, which Engelbart read while stationed as a US Navy radar technician in the Philippines in 1946.",
              "[2] In Engelbart's view, in order to steer society into the right use of scientific knowledge derived from the war, that knowledge would need to be better managed and regulated.",
              "[2] In his book From Counterculture to Cyberculture, Fred Turner gave voice to this view, which arose from seeing the unintended effects of technology on the postwar world:[3] [T]he American military had developed technologies with which it might destroy the world.",
              "In its wake, scientists and technologists had begun to fan out around the globe, seeking to use their knowledge to eradicate disease and increase food production, often in an effort to win the cold war loyalties of Third World nations.",
              "Engelbart had read about these efforts and saw that they often backfired.",
              "Rapid food production led to the depletion of the soil;",
              "the eradication of insects led to ecological imbalances.",
              "This ultimately led to the idea that beyond merely performing calculations, computers could be used to augment the capabilities of the human mind.",
              "[3] Engelbart had assembled a team of computer engineers and programmers at his Augmentation Research Center (ARC) located in Stanford University's Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the early 1960s.",
              "[4] His idea was to free computing from merely being about number crunching and for it to become a tool for communications and information-retrieval.",
              "[5] He wanted to turn Vannevar Bush's idea for a Memex machine into reality, where a machine used interactively by one person could \"augment\" their intelligence.",
              "[5] Over the course of six years, with the funding help of both NASA and ARPA,[6] his team went about putting together all the elements that would make such a computer system a reality.",
              "At the urging of ARPA's director, Robert Taylor, the NLS would make its first public appearance at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco's Civic Auditorium.",
              "[7] The conference session was presented under the title A research center for augmenting human intellect.",
              "[8] Approximately 1,000 computer professionals were in attendance in the auditorium to witness the presentation.",
              "[9] Notable attendees in the audience included Alan Kay, Charles Irby and Andy van Dam,[10] as well as Bob Sproull.",
              "[11] Engelbart, with the help of his geographically distributed team (including Bill Paxton), with Bill English directing the presentation's technical elements, demonstrated NLS's functions.",
              "[Note 1] The presentation used an Eidophor video projector that allowed the video output from the NLS computer to be displayed on a large 6.",
              "7 metres (22 ft) high screen so the audience could see what Engelbart was doing.",
              "[13] The Augment researchers also created two customized homemade modems at 1200 baud \u2013 high-speed for 1968 \u2013 linked via a leased line to transfer data from the computer workstation keyboard and mouse at the Civic Auditorium to their Menlo Park headquarters' SDS-940 computer.",
              "[Note 2] In order to provide live two-way video between the lab and the conference hall, two microwave links were used.",
              "English also commanded a video switcher that controlled what was displayed on the big screen.",
              "The camera operator in Menlo Park was Stewart Brand\u2014at the time, a non-computer person, best known as the editor of the Whole Earth Catalog\u2014who also advised Engelbart and the team about how to present the demo.",
              "[14] During the 90-minute presentation, Engelbart used his mouse prototype to move around the screen, highlight text, and resize windows.",
              "[15] This was the first time that an integrated system for manipulating text onscreen was presented publicly.",
              "[15][Note 3] At separate times, his Augment associates Jeff Rulifson and Bill Paxton appeared in another portion of the screen to help edit the text remotely from ARC.",
              "While they were editing they could see each other's screen, talk and see each other as well.",
              "He further demonstrated that clicking on underlined text would then link to another page of information, demonstrating the concept of hypertext.",
              "[4] When he finished the demonstration, the audience gave him a standing ovation.",
              "To further demonstrate the system, a separate room was set aside so that attendees could take a closer look at the NLS workstations and ask Engelbart questions.",
              "[4] One last notion is that of Engelbart's NLS system.",
              "As Fred Turner stated in his book From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Engelbart promulgated a philosophy of 'bootstrapping', in which each experimental transformation of the socio-technical system that was the NLS would feed back into the system itself, causing it to evolve (and presumably to improve).",
              "[17] Prior to the demonstration, a significant portion of the computer science community thought Engelbart was \"a crackpot\".",
              "[15] When he was finished, he was described as \"dealing lightning with both hands\".",
              "[18] Van Dam was working on a similar system, but had only begun work on it in 1967, and was stunned to see how mature NLS was: he practically accosted Engelbart with his line of questioning in the post-presentation question and answer session.",
              "[19] After he finished interrogating Engelbart, van Dam agreed the NLS demo was the greatest thing he ever witnessed.",
              "[19] Van Dam would go on to become a leader in teaching computer graphics in the 1970s.",
              "[20] The actual impact on computer science, however, was limited: Everybody was blown away and thought it was absolutely fantastic and nothing else happened.",
              "There was almost no further impact.",
              "People thought it was too far out and they were still working on their physical teletypes, hadn't even migrated to glass teletypes yet.",
              "So it sparked interest in a small vigorous research community but it didn't have impact on the computer field as a whole.",
              "As the 1970s started, much of Engelbart's team departed ARC and went their own ways, with many of them ending up at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).",
              "Among these people were Bill English, who would further improve upon the mouse.",
              "[4] Also migrating to PARC was Engelbart's former backer at NASA and ARPA, Robert Taylor.",
              "[21] Alan Kay, also in attendance at the demo, would go on to design an object-oriented computing environment called Smalltalk while he was at PARC.",
              "[15] By 1973, the Xerox Alto was a fully functional personal computer similar to the NLS terminal which Engelbart had demonstrated in 1968, but much smaller and physically refined.",
              "With its mouse-driven GUI, the Alto would go on to influence Steve Jobs and Apple's Macintosh computer and operating system in the 1980s.",
              "[22] Eventually, Microsoft's Windows operating system would follow the Macintosh and use a multi-button mouse like the Alto and the NLS system did.",
              "[1] Engelbart's influence peaked at the conference, and he was mostly remembered throughout the 1970s and much of the 1980s as the inventor of the mouse and hypertext, famously adapted by Apple and Microsoft.",
              "On the demo's 30th anniversary in 1998, Stanford University held a major conference to celebrate Engelbart's visionary impact on computing and the World Wide Web.",
              "[23] By the time the 40th anniversary was celebrated, Engelbart's demo was acknowledged as one of the most important in computer history.",
              "[24] In 2015, a performance art musical presentation called The Demo depicted the event.",

              "He was asking them to take too big a leap, from doing calculations on punch cards to creating a new information superhighway.",
              "In the mid-1970s, Engelbart\u2019s lab, which he called the Augmentation Research Center, used government funding to support the quickly growing ARPANET.",
              "In a highly unorthodox move, he hired young women who\u2019d graduated from Stanford with degrees in fields like anthropology and sociology.",
              "Engelbart, who had three daughters himself, believed that women were ideally suited to building new cultures.",
              "He sent his new hires out to other institutions to build \u201cnetworked improvement communities.",
              "\u201d This got him in a lot of trouble.",
              "The ARPANET\u2019s funders couldn\u2019t see why real people needed to support users.",
              "They saw his hires as a sign of failure\u2014his systems weren\u2019t easy enough to use on their own.",
              "What Engelbart failed to communicate was that these women weren\u2019t just teaching people which keys to press.",
              "He wanted them to bring together thinkers who could, collectively, change the way the networks collected and analyzed information.",
              "Before long, the government reduced his funding, foreshadowing the end of his Augmentation Research Center.",
              "Later in the 1970s, Engelbart lost his key engineers to Xerox PARC lab, a lavish and well-funded research center a few miles away.",
              "At the head was Alan Kay, 15 years Engelbart\u2019s junior\u2014an upbeat, brilliant guy who knew how to inspire people.",
              "The laboratory chief was Engelbart\u2019s former funder from ARPA, Robert Taylor.",
              "For Engelbart, networks had always been an inextricable part of his vision.",
              "But under Kay\u2019s direction, the engineers created a personal computer, geared toward individual productivity rather than collaboration.",
              "Their software included more user-friendly versions of a few of Engelbart\u2019s original ideas, including multiple windows, text with integrated graphics, and the mouse.",
              "A cruel joke of the time was that Engelbart\u2019s Augmentation Research Center had been a training program for PARC.",
              "In 1979, Xerox allowed Steve Jobs and other Apple executives to tour its labs twice, in exchange for the right to buy 100,000 shares of Apple stock.",
              "Once Jobs began working on these ideas, they became even more streamlined.",
              "Engelbart\u2019s mouse had three buttons, which he used in different combinations to perform a range of tasks.",
              "After licensing this invention from the Stanford Research Institute, Apple decided it would be simpler to give it just one button.",
              "Engelbart lamented that the mouse\u2019s capability had been dumbed down to make it \u201ceasy to use.",
              "\u201d Ironically, the mouse was the one invention that earned Engelbart widespread recognition, though it never earned him more than an initial lump sum of $10,000 from the Stanford Research Institute.",
              "He was bewildered that the simplest artifact from his grand vision had been the most widely embraced.",
              "After all, he\u2019d foreshadowed just about everything Apple and Microsoft went on to create\u2014at a time when Jobs and Bill Gates were just 13 years old.",
              "Alan Kay himself once remarked, \u201cI don\u2019t know what Silicon Valley will do when it runs out of Doug\u2019s ideas.",
              "\u201d Engelbart\u2019s refusal to compromise was one of the main reasons he had a hard time gathering momentum.",
              "He often ended discussions by declaring, \u201cYou just don\u2019t get it.",
              "\u201d That catchphrase cost Engelbart dearly.",
              "His detractors snidely remarked that the great proponent of collaboration was, ironically, unable to collaborate.",
              "I myself was at the receiving end of Engelbart\u2019s insults on several occasions.",
              "But no matter how irritably he behaved as a colleague, I knew he had great love for me as a person.",
              "And I understood why he so often felt frustrated.",
              "As I saw it, his ideas were so ahead of their time that there was often no language to describe them.",
              "When I asked him in 2006 how much of his vision had been achieved, Engelbart answered, \u201cAbout 2.",
              "8 percent.",
              "\u201d Because his system was designed to present the same information from different angles, it was more than a rudimentary version of the software we use today.",
              "I believe it was better equipped than Apple\u2019s or Microsoft\u2019s programs to solving problems like peace, income inequality, sustainable development and climate change.",
              "He designed it for sophisticated knowledge workers\u2014writers, designers, data analysts, economists.",
              "Even Google\u2019s collaborative apps are less ideally suited to do serious work that integrates libraries of data, documents, graphics, text and information maps.",
              "Engelbart\u2019s system came with a learning curve, but he believed the result was worth it.",
              "When people praised other software for being more intuitive, he asked them whether they\u2019d rather ride a tricycle or a bicycle.",
              "Although he earned over 40 awards\u2014including the National Medal of Technology & Innovation, the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize and several honorary doctorates\u2014Engelbart often felt demoralized.",
              "He died in 2013, after suffering from kidney failure.",
              "But many of us are still inspired by his dream.",
              "As a professor, I\u2019ve brought his ideas to the classroom and seen them change the way my students think.",
              "As one of them wrote in a letter to our university president, \u201cTeam members are thinking together and tapping into the collective IQ to augment individual performance, and the whole of our group is much greater than the sum of its parts.",
              "It is an exhilarating and rewarding experience.",
