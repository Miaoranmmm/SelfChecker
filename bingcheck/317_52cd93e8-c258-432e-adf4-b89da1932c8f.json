              "The Holocaust and the racial hygiene doctrine that helped rationalize it still overshadow contemporary debates about using gene editing for disease prevention.",
              "In part, this is because prevention can mean 3 different things, which are often conflated.",
              "Phenotypic prevention involves modifying the expression of pathogenic DNA variants to forestall their clinical effects in at-risk patients.",
              "Genotypic prevention involves controlling transmission of pathogenic variants between generations to avoid the birth of affected offspring.",
              "Preventive strengthening seeks to improve normal human traits to resist disease.",
              "These distinctions have been neglected in human gene editing governance discussions and are clarified in this article.",
              "The scientific racism and eugenic delusions that led to the Holocaust are widely eschewed by members of human genetics and genomics communities today.",
              "1 Yet the Holocaust\u2019s long shadow is still evident in public anxiety about our growing ability to control human genes\u2019 expression and transmission.",
              "Today, the focus of this anxiety is on the suite of new molecular tools for gene editing that promises to revitalize the enterprise of human gene therapy.",
              "Since the first demonstration that these tools can be used to modify genetic mechanisms in human cells more precisely and efficiently than older forms of gene transfer, global organizations charged with their oversight have produced a deluge of reports and statements proposing ethical guidelines for these tools\u2019 use.",
              "2 Most of these reports concentrate on immediate research ethics questions raised by the development of any new biomedical innovation: questions about physical risk, informed consent, and fair distribution of research benefits and burdens.",
              "But behind those deliberations, the memory of the Holocaust surfaces more fundamental ethical questions about where this research leads and the worry that we could repeat the mistake of creating genetic hierarchies from social prejudices and try again to remake our species against the backdrop of a fundamentally unjust vision of human health.",
              "This background concern manifests itself in the new wave of gene editing governance documents that frame discussion of gene editing regulation on the presumption of 2 boundaries: (1) restricting gene editing to treating disease rather than furthering human enhancement and (2) restricting research to somatic cell rather than germline interventions.",
              "3 The clinical uncertainties and risks of earlier gene therapy technologies have been sufficient to support widespread consensus on both of these boundaries within the scientific community since they were first articulated in the 1980s.",
              "But the improved safety, efficacy, and efficiency promised by the new gene editing techniques are now opening the way to renewed discussions of both conventional limits.",
              "If technical promises of gene editing technology can be realized, society will need to reconsider the conceptual and moral merits of these boundaries directly against the historical shadow of the Holocaust that inspired them.",
              "The concept of prevention has an underappreciated but potent role to play in these debates.",
              "Medical applications that have been endorsed when drawing a line against genetic modification for enhancement purposes have traditionally been understood to be treatments for severe diseases.",
              "Many of the recent reports on human gene editing governance, however, go beyond treatment to include disease prevention as an ethically acceptable research goal,4 which accords with precision genomic medicine efforts in genetic risk assessment and pharmacogenomics.",
              "But, in genome editing, prevention as a concept easily subsumes and conflates 3 interpretations of prevention goals, which I call phenotypic prevention,5 genotypic prevention,5 and preventive strengthening.",
              "3 Each has ethical implications that should be disambiguated and clarified.",
              "Under the banners of precision and personalized medicine, advances in human genome research are making it increasingly possible to detect pathogenic genomic variants before their problematic clinical phenotypes are expressed in specific patients.",
              "One of the hopes for human gene editing research is to use our new abilities to correct or replace those variants to forestall the clinical health problems they can cause.",
              "Phenotypic prevention of this sort is not an unusual goal for biomedical research.",
              "It reflects a goal shared by many medical interventions\u2014from drugs to surgeries and biobehavioral interventions\u2014that attempt to intervene early enough in the course of a patient\u2019s malady to preempt the deleterious effects that the patient would otherwise experience.",
              "The only difference between preventive gene editing and the phenotypic prevention provided by other traditional medical means is the former\u2019s promise to act earlier and more completely by intervening at the genomic level.",
              "Achieving the goal of phenotypic prevention can raise a wide range of ethical questions, as the extensive literatures on ethical challenges in predictive genetic testing and somatic cell gene therapy document.",
              "6 But as a translational goal for biomedical research, the close alignment of phenotypic prevention with biomedicine\u2019s traditional ethical imperative to help specific patients avoid suffering gives it a widely endorsed prima facie moral authority.",
              "This acceptance is reflected in interventions ranging from newborn genetic screening programs and presymptomatic genetic testing for late onset disorders to efforts to use somatic cell gene therapy to forestall the clinical sequelae of cancer through \u201ccancer vaccination\u201d protocols.",
              "7 An important conceptual premise of phenotypic prevention that helps ground its medical moral authority is the assumption that its beneficiary is an identifiable individual patient whose suffering we have an obligation to address.",
              "For human gene editing protocols aimed at modifying the somatic cells of a particular patient to forestall deleterious effects of detected pathogenic variants, this criterion is easily met.",
              "But now that basic gene editing research suggests that it might be possible to introduce the same preventive changes in germline cells on behalf of future patients, what does this imply?",
              "The Holocaust remains history\u2019s grimmest warning against the idea that \u201cracial hygiene\u201d could mimic public health efforts against infectious disease.",
              "Some would argue that gene editing interventions in early embryos that are designed to prevent diseases in later life are just as clearly examples of phenotypic prevention as newborn screening and\u2014assuming they can be accomplished safely\u2014should enjoy the same level of ethical acceptance.",
              "This, for example, was the line of argument that He Jiankui used to defend his effort to prevent HIV infection by editing the CCR5 gene in human embryos.",
              "8 Successfully defending embryo engineering as a form of phenotypic prevention, however, involves resolving a number of contentious philosophical questions about the identity, individuation, and moral status of early embryos as subjects of the intervention.",
              "For those who would rather leave those judgments to parents, it makes more sense to reframe the goal of such interventions as preventing the occurrence of a predictable health problem within a family rather than its manifestation within a particular patient.",
              "This understanding of the preventive goal of germline gene editing is even clearer when it is contemplated before conception, as interventions on gametes of prospective parents.",
              "The goal is to avoid the \u201cvertical transmission\u201d of pathogenic genotypes within families rather than the manifestation of pathological symptoms within a particular patient.",
              "9 When scholars point to the availability of preimplantation screening and embryo selection to argue that embryo editing will almost always be unnecessary to prevent genetic disease, they are assuming that this form of prevention\u2014genotypic prevention\u2014is the goal under discussion.",
              "10 But preventing transmission of particular genetic variants between generations is different than preventing the manifestation of a disease in a patient, with a much more contentious history.",
              "Phenotypic prevention assumes the existence of a patient whose health problems might be forestalled.",
              "Thus, attempts to sort preventive interventions in genetic medicine into the traditional levels of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention used in preventive medicine and public health usually locate examples of phenotypic prevention, such as newborn genetic screening, at the level of secondary prevention,11 on the assumption that their aim is to interrupt an existing disease process in an affected patient rather than to prevent the inheritance of its causes.",
              "But the medical genetic interventions that get classified as primary prevention, such as prenatal and carrier screening, are not about keeping specific patients from acquiring disease-causing genes, as in infectious disease contexts.",
              "Instead, the goal of genotypic prevention is usually framed in terms of the interests of prospective parents by allowing them to avoid having children with foreseeable health problems. As disabilities scholars point out, this goal implies that one feature of genotypic prevention is always the tacit judgment that the burden of coping with new cases of genetic disease can outweigh any other value that individuals with the target genotypes might bring to a family or community.",
              "12 The tradition in modern clinical genetics has been to accept and support the reproductive decisions of prospective parents making well-informed, uncoerced decisions about their family\u2019s welfare under the rubric of nondirective genetic counseling.",
              "If germline gene editing of gametes and preimplantation of edited embryos is ever feasible, respect for reproductive autonomy should equally extend to these technologies.",
              "However, interventions aimed at genotypic prevention are also often evaluated in social and public health terms, according to their ability to reduce the incidence of genetic disability and disease in a population.",
              "For example, famous population-wide programs of genotypic prevention, such as Mediterranean carrier screening programs for beta-thalassemia or Tay-Sachs screening in Ashkenazi communities, are deemed success stories because they have reduced the number of community members with these conditions, not because they have enhanced parental autonomy.",
              "13,14 Should this logic also apply to germline gene editing efforts?",
              "Expanding the preventive goals of gene editing to include population interests broadens genetic medicine\u2019s responsibilities beyond the health needs of specific families to the next generation\u2019s aggregate population.",
              "This expansion makes it easy to import public health goals into gene editing and to subordinate familial decision making to population needs.",
              "Unfortunately, genotypic prevention already has an infamous track record along these line in the excesses of 20th-century eugenic efforts to \u201cpurify and protect\u201d idealized parts of the human gene pool from so-called contamination from immigration, interracial marriage, and the \u201cfeeble-minded.",
              "\u201d15 The Holocaust remains history\u2019s grimmest warning against the idea that \u201cracial hygiene\u201d could mimic public health efforts against infectious disease to prevent the vertical transmission of particular genotypes in the name of health promotion.",
              "To the extent that germline editing is associated with professional allegiance to genotypic prevention at the population level, it inherits all the history, erroneous assumptions, and moral liabilities of this past, which dims the prospects for well-reasoned public assessments of its merits.",
              "Since the inception of human gene transfer research in the 1980s, public policy and professional opinion has discouraged researchers from pursuing interventions aimed at human enhancement because of the value judgments such pursuits would entail and the questions of justice they provoke.",
              "16 Indeed, current proposals for governing human gene editing research largely stand by 1980s research restrictions on enhancement applications.",
              "2 But current studies of genetic variants that are benign, functional, or even beneficial suggest another way in which gene editing might approach prevention: by enhancing normal traits to build resistance to disease.",
              "Should this vision of preventive strengthening trigger worries about human enhancement or be embraced as a legitimate translational goal for gene editing research?",
              "Under the banner of \u201cwellness genomics,\u201d scientists are already identifying natural genomic variants they see as helping their carriers resist disease, tolerate environmental extremes, and rebound from injuries more quickly.",
              "17 When gene editors use these variants to try to upgrade such traits in nonhuman animals, they do so in the name of preserving health and draw analogies to vaccines as human immune system upgrades that help us combat infection by certain pathogens.",
              "3 A recent human gene editing governance report suggests that research justified in terms of preventive strengthening of humans could also be used to justify translational goals of gene editing research.",
              "4 But preventive strengthening interventions can also raise the same concerns about equity and human nature that haunt nonclinical conceptions of human enhancement.",
              "Some preventive strengthening interventions, such as those promising to build resistance to anticipated injury or boost the ability to better tolerate sleep deprivation,18 might confer serendipitous social advantages to those with such physical enhancements.",
              "A preventive strengthening intervention to increase muscle mass in muscular dystrophy patients, for example, could be used \u201coff label\u201d to enhance healthy people who want more muscle mass for social purposes.",
              "19 The result is an interesting challenge for gene editing governance that has yet to be addressed: if the same interventions can serve legitimate preventive goals in some patients and be used by others for enhancement purposes, how should their development and use be managed?",
              "To anticipate the ethical challenges that can attend the 3 senses of prevention distinguished here \u2014phenotypic prevention, genotypic prevention, and preventive strengthening\u2014the policies that govern human gene editing must appreciate their differences and implications.",
              "Each form of prevention sends us in a different direction for guidance: phenotypic prevention, to our emerging experience with preemptive genetic medicine;",
              "genotypic prevention, to our history of efforts to control gene flow;",
              "and preventive strengthening, to the translational pipelines of beneficial genomic variant research.",
              "What should integrate and ground these efforts is a renewed resolve to never again allow invidious genetic value judgments to undermine our commitment to our common human moral equality in the face of our biological diversity.",

              "Genetic models of disease A major goal of the Feng lab is to precisely define what goes wrong in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders by engineering animal models that carry the gene mutations that cause these disorders in humans.",
              "New models can be generated by injecting embryos with gene editing tools, along with a piece of DNA carrying the desired mutation.",
              "In one such method, the gene editing tool CRISPR is programmed to cut a targeted gene, thereby activating natural DNA mechanisms that \u201crepair\u201d the broken gene with the injected template DNA.",
              "The engineered cells are then used to generate offspring capable of passing the genetic change on to further generations, creating a stable genetic line in which the disease, and therapies, are tested.",
              "Although CRISPR has accelerated the process of generating such disease models, the process can still take months or years.",
              "Reasons for the inefficiency are that many treated cells do not undergo the desired DNA sequence change at all, and the change only occurs on one of the two gene copies (for most genes, each cell contains two versions, one from the father and one from the mother).",
              "In an effort to increase the efficiency of the gene editing process, the Feng lab team initially hypothesized that adding a DNA repair protein called RAD51 to a standard mixture of CRISPR gene editing tools would increase the chances that a cell (in this case a fertilized mouse egg, or one-cell embryo) would undergo the desired genetic change.",
              "As a test case, they measured the rate at which they were able to insert (\u201cknock-in\u201d) a mutation in the gene Chd2 that is associated with autism.",
              "The overall proportion of embryos that were correctly edited remained unchanged, but to their surprise, a significantly higher percentage carried the desired gene edit on both chromosomes.",
              "Tests with a different gene yielded the same unexpected outcome.",
              "\u201cEditing of both chromosomes simultaneously is normally very uncommon,\u201d explains postdoc Jonathan Wilde.",
              "\u201cThe high rate of editing seen with RAD51 was really striking, and what started as a simple attempt to make mutant Chd2 mice quickly turned into a much bigger project focused on RAD51 and its applications in genome editing,\u201d says Wilde, who co-authored the Cell paper with research scientist Tomomi Aida.",
              "A molecular copy machine The Feng lab team next set out to understand the mechanism by which RAD51 enhances gene editing.",
              "They hypothesized that RAD51 engages a process called interhomolog repair (IHR), whereby a DNA break on one chromosome is repaired using the second copy of the chromosome (from the other parent) as the template.",
              "To test this, they injected mouse embryos with RAD51 and CRISPR but left out the template DNA.",
              "They programmed CRISPR to cut only the gene sequence on one of the chromosomes, and then tested whether it was repaired to match the sequence on the uncut chromosome.",
              "For this experiment, they had to use mice in which the sequences on the maternal and paternal chromosomes were different.",
              "They found that control embryos injected with CRISPR alone rarely showed IHR repair.",
              "However, addition of RAD51 significantly increased the number of embryos in which the CRISPR-targeted gene was edited to match the uncut chromosome.",
              "\u201cPrevious studies of IHR found that it is incredibly inefficient in most cells,\u201d says Wilde.",
              "\u201cOur finding that it occurs much more readily in embryonic cells and can be enhanced by RAD51 suggest that a deeper understanding of what makes the embryo permissive to this type of DNA repair could help us design safer and more efficient gene therapies.",
              "\u201d A new way to correct disease-causing mutations Standard gene therapy strategies that rely on injecting a corrective piece of DNA to serve as a template for repairing the mutation engage a process called homology-directed repair (HDR).",
              "\u201cHDR-based strategies still suffer from low efficiency and carry the risk of unwanted integration of donor DNA throughout the genome,\u201d explains Feng.",
              "\u201cIHR has the potential to overcome these problems because it relies upon natural cellular pathways and the patient\u2019s own normal chromosome for correction of the deleterious mutation.",
              "\u201d Feng\u2019s team went on to identify additional DNA repair-associated proteins that can stimulate IHR, including several that not only promote high levels of IHR, but also repress errors in the DNA repair process.",
              "Additional experiments that allowed the team to examine the genomic features of IHR events gave deeper insight into the mechanism of IHR and suggested ways that the technique can be used to make gene therapies safer.",
              "\u201cWhile there is still a great deal to learn about this new application of IHR, our findings are the foundation for a new gene therapy approach that could help solve some of the big problems with current approaches,\u201d says Aida.",

              "It is worth noting that some mutations are distinctive to certain types and sub-types of cancer, providing bases for either universal or tailored therapies, compatible with the molecular profile of neoplastic cells.",
              "Conventional cancer therapies such as the surgical removal of solid tumours, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, can suffer from low specificity and are encumbered with multiple and severe side effects.",
              "Therefore, current trends in oncology focus on increasing the selectivity and safety of developed therapies, with the rise of hormone therapy, immunotherapy and targeted drugs, including anti-angiogenics and growth blockers [7,8].",
              "The recent discovery of precise gene editing tools has heralded an era in which modern treatment options can include therapies which directly target genes responsible for the continuous growth and survival of cancerous cells.",
              "In principle, gene editing techniques employ various nucleases to introduce single or Double-strand breaks (DSBs) to the DNA strand at a specific site to install a permanent change in the genome.",
              "The first attempts at genetic therapies in oncology were based on Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) or Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) [9].",

              "Unfortunately, therapies based on ZFNs or TALENs are less feasible for diverse applications as the process of re-engineering guiding proteins is costly and time-consuming [9,10].",
              "Seminal work in 2012 developed a gene editing tool from the adaptive immune system of bacteria and archea which has proved simpler, more affordable and reliable compared to previous gene editing tools [11,12,13,14].",
              "The clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR- associated protein 9 (Cas9) system uses short complementary strands of RNA, known as single guide RNA (sgRNA), to recognize and bind to specific DNA sequences through Watson-Crick base pairing.",
              "This directs a Cas9 nuclease to perform site-specific DNA cleavage mediated by its two nickase domains, RuvC and HNH.",
              "In addition to being easier to program compared to ZFNs and TALENs, CRISPR/Cas9 facilitates \u2018multiplexing\u2019 of more than one sgRNA to target multiple DNA sites simultaneously.",
              "A potential limitation with CRISPR/Cas9 technology is the requirement of a Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site on the DNA upstream of the target site to enable the sgRNA to bind [15].",
              "The PAM site recognized by the most common Cas9 isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes, SpCas9, is the trinucleotide NGG (in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction), where N is any of the four DNA nucleotides.",
              "Fortunately, this PAM site recurs in the human genome every 8 base pairs and Cas9 nucleases with other PAM requirements have also been described or created [16,17,18].",
              "The DSBs created by CRISPR/Cas9 are repaired through two endogenous cellular mechanisms: Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR) [19,20].",
              "NHEJ is an error-prone process which reattaches cut ends of DNA but can also cause the random insertion or deletion (indels) of nucleotides at the break site, possibly resulting in complete gene knock-out, if a frame-shift is induced in a coding region.",
              "HDR processes, by contrast, enable the precise alteration of a sequence following a DSB by incorporating a DNA donor template containing an edit.",
              "However, HDR is inefficient and therefore can limit the percentage of cancer cells which undergo high fidelity editing [21].",
              "Furthermore, as the NHEJ process predominates, the stochastic indel formation at the break site can possibly cause unpredictable changes in gene function.",
              "To surmount this, proprietary small molecule reagents have been developed and show promise in inhibiting NHEJ and enhancing HDR rates by up to 7-fold [22].",
              "However, the most significant drawback with using CRISPR/Cas9 is its propensity to cleave regions of the genome with a similar DNA sequence to the target site, a phenomenon known as \u2018off-target editing\u2019.",
              "Off-target editing can introduce DSBs and indel mutations in critical regions causing deleterious changes in gene function or even tumorgenicity itself.",
              "Harnessing in silico prediction tools can help counter this by designing sgRNAs less likely to exhibit off-target editing [23].",
              "Modification to the Cas9 nuclease has demonstrated some benefits in improving the safety of CRISPR/Cas9 therapy, (see Table 1).",
              "Highly specific Cas9 variants have been shown to reduce off-target editing to almost undetectable levels [24] and techniques which employ two evolved Cas9 \u2018nickases\u2019, which each instituting a single-stranded break on the DNA, have also demonstrated a reduction in indel formation and off-target editing [25].",
              "Rigorous genome-wide screening for off-target activity post-editing would be a cornerstone of any work on cancer therapy.",
              "Available modifications of Cas9 protein employed to alternatively affect recognised DNA sequence, without introduction of DSBs [10,23,35,36,37,38,39].",
              "A large proportion of genetic mutations in cancer is comprised of single-nucleotide changes in genes like NOTCH [26,27], EGFR [28] and KRAS [29].",
              "These point mutations are potentially targetable by CRISPR-related RNA-programmable deaminases, known as base editors (BEs) (see Table 1).",
              "BEs unwind a short region of DNA known as the \u2018editing window\u2019 at the specific site and uses a deaminase to enzymatically alter the base [30].",
              "A significant advantage of base editing is that it obviates the introduction of DSBs and therefore prevents activation of the NHEJ pathway and indel mutations, unlike conventional CRISPR/Cas9.",
              "Furthermore, BEs do not rely on HDR repair so higher editing efficiencies can be pursued, and demonstrated, and a DNA donor template is not required which simplifies mRNA-based delivery systems [31].",
              "There are currently two main groups of BEs, Adenine base editors (ABEs) which convert A-T base pairs to G-C base pairs and Cystosine base editors (CBEs) which engender the reverse change of C-G base pairs to T-A base pairs.",
              "On the other hand, base editors also exhibit off-targeting activity like conventional CRISPR/Cas9 editors and there is an additional risk of the deamination of other \u2018bystander\u2019 nucleotides within the same editing window.",
              "A further limitation of base editing is that it is constrained by its mechanism to only effecting transition point mutations [32] and therefore different tools are required to introduce other mutations in the genome.",
              "The recent expansion of the gene editing toolbox with \u2018prime editing\u2019 may resolve this issue [33].",
              "Prime editing is a novel DSB-free method of manipulating the genome with targeted insertions, deletions, and all base substitutions, conferring greater flexibility compared to BEs.",
              "Prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) are deployed alongside a Prime editor (PE) protein which creates a single-stranded break at the target site and drives the inclusion of a new editing sequence through reverse transcription.",
              "The latest PE variants demonstrate comparable editing efficiencies to CRISPR/Cas9 and base editing tools, with diminished off-target and bystander editing [34], suggesting future promise for targeting oncogenic mutations.",
              "A unique problem of gene editing therapies targeting cancerous cells is that the driver mutations occur usually in genes responsible for proper functioning of cells and these mutations are present only in a portion of patient\u2019s cells derived from healthy and normal tissue.",
              "Therefore, systemic therapy-without the use of cancer-targeting techniques-could lead to dangerous and unpredictable consequences, including death of affected non-cancerous cells throughout the organism.",
              "This review aims at presenting the most recently explored strategies for cancer-specific CRISPR/Cas9-based oncological therapies, that do not affect healthy cells and tissues.",
              "The CRISPR/Cas9 system, before it can introduce programmed genetic changes, needs to be delivered to the cells of interest and penetrate the barriers of the cell and nuclear membranes.",
              "In vitro delivery thus far has been mostly based on simple and efficient non-specific techniques introducing plasmids encoding Cas9 and sgRNA, such as electroporation or microinjection [40].",
              "Plasmid-based transfection in vivo is possible e.",
              "g., in mice via hydrodynamic infusion through the tail vein, but suffers from low efficiency.",
              "Moreover, this technique is not suitable for use in humans [18,37,41].",
              "To ensure safety and effectiveness of therapy designed for patients, CRISPR/Cas9 needs to be first enveloped in a delivery capsule, either viral or non-viral such as vesicles.",
              "The CRISPR/Cas9 tools can be transported as a ready-assembled protein-sgRNA complex or form the complex intracellularly.",
              "It can also be delivered as mRNA or as genes encoding Cas9 and the sgRNA which require subsequent expression [42,43].",
              "Each of these delivery modes has its relative advantages and limitations and may be favourable in certain experimental setting (see Table 2).",
              "These basic delivery models need to be further properly adjusted and modified to ensure selective uptake of carriers containing CRISPR/Cas9 by cancerous cells.",
              "Herein we describe some of the recently explored ideas and strategies for targeted delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 system.",
              "Pros and cons of most popular delivery methods [41,44].",
              "Initially viral vectors were used as delivery model for genes, since they have a natural ability to introduce their own genetic material to infected cells.",
              "However, some concerns were raised about their safety due to immunogenicity and inherent pathogenicity.",
              "A solution was found in a better tolerated, non-pathogenic and non-integrating recombinant form of adenovirus preparations\u2019 contaminant named Adeno-associated virus (AAV) [45].",
              "Several serotypes of AAV have been described and some display a particular affinity to different tissues and organs.",
              "In an experiment conducted on mice transfected with nine different serotypes of AAV via tail vein injection, AAV pseudotype 4 led to the highest expression of genetic material in lungs and kidneys followed by heart, while AAV 6 showed tropism to heart, brain and liver [46].",
              "Unfortunately, the expression of the delivered luciferase gene was diminished but detectable in other tissues, meaning that genetic manipulations could affect multiple organs or even a whole body.",
              "While this may be acceptable or even desirable in therapies for congenital hereditary disorders, it is certainly not specific enough for cancer therapy.",
              "However, coupling AAV delivery with some of the targeted expression strategies described below, could result in precise and safe gene engineering.",
              "Another obstacle to AAV-based CRISPR/Cas9 delivery is its low capacity.",
              "AAVs can pack up to approximately 5 kbp of DNA in a payload (including viral flanking sequences), while the SpCas9 gene itself is about 4.",
              "1 kbp long [9,18,45] and introduced genes usually require the addition of a suitable promoter to undergo transcription.",
              "The main strategy to circumvent this is to load the Cas9 gene and sgRNA into separate AAV vectors introduced simultaneously.",
              "However, this approach hinders the efficacy of delivery and gene manipulation, since each cell needs to be transfected with both versions of AAV.",
              "As the effectiveness of delivery remaines below 100%, the probability of successful outcomes decreases with each additional vector required to obtain desired results [47].",
              "Alternatively, Cas9 orthologs encoded by shorter genes have been found in different bacterial species which can replace the SpCas9 in AAV payloads.",
              "The sequence of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) gene is 1 kbp smaller in size than Cas9 found in Streptococcus pyogenes and Campylobacter jejuni Cas9 protein (CjCas9) gene is shorter by 2.",
              "95 kbp than SpCas9 [48,49,50].",
              "When considering the use of SpCas9 ortholog it is worth remembering, that alternative Cas9 proteins require different PAM sequences for successful gene manipulation.",
              "Another approach at viral vector delivery is based on Oncolytic viruses (OV) which are viruses that preferably replicate in cancerous cells.",
              "OV take advantage of the impaired response to pro-apoptotic signals in cancerous cells and the acquired resistance to apoptosis which protects normal, healthy cells from infection.",
              "Currently most frequently explored OV for oncological therapies include Herpes simplex virus (HSV), mumps, adenovirus, vaccinia virus and retrovirus [51,52].",
              "Modifications introduced to these viruses aim at increasing their specificity, safety and immunogenicity.",
              "The immunostimulatory activity of OV is of utmost importance, restoring the natural anti-tumour response of patient\u2019s immune system.",
              "Numerous clinical trials are therefore testing therapies based solely on oncolytic viruses as an anti-cancer agent [52,53], however, the propensity of OV to infect neoplasms, makes it a perfect candidate for a delivery system for CRISPR/Cas9.",
              "Recently, the myxoma virus (MYXV) was used as a vector for CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the NRAS gene in xenografts of embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma in mice after traditional viral vectors had failed.",
              "The large packaging capacity of the OV (161.",
              "8 kbp) augmented the utility of the oncolytic myxoma virus and allowed for the simultaneous targeting of multiple sequences.",
              "Replication of the administered MYXV was restricted to cancerous tissue and the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated NRAS inactivation resulted in reduction of tumour growth and increased survival of mice.",
              "However, eventually, all tumours relapsed [54].",
              "CRISPR/Cas9 delivery in non-viral lipid-based vectors is generally safer than viruses, but also less efficient [44].",
              "Liposomal transporters offer a broad variety of available modifications, allowing for precise control over the physico-chemical properties of their surface and the introduction of targeting ligands [55].",
              "Antibody-guided system emerged in combination with Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), that comprise a well-known delivery system for genetic material, initially developed and standardized for treatment with small interfering RNA (siRNA) [49,56].",
              "Recently, LNPs were used in a proof-of-concept study to target disseminated ovarian cancer in mice with CRISPR/Cas9.",
              "Complexes were constructed from ionizable cationic amino lipids coated with anti-EGFR antibodies, providing cancer-specific uptake.",
              "The vector contained mRNA for Cas9 and sgRNA targeting the PLK1 gene.",
              "Systemic intraperitoneal injection of LNPs resulted in their accumulation in EGFR-overexpressing cancer cells and resulted in an approximately 82% editing rate of PLK1 and increased survival by around 80% [57].",
              "The elegance and usefulness of this solution lies in the antibody-guided neoplasm-specific delivery, since anti-EGFR can be easily swapped for another immunoglobulin targeting different antigen expressed on cells of interest.",
              "A noteworthy protein-free alternative to antibodies was found in three-dimensional structures of single-stranded nucleic acids, termed aptamers.",
              "After in vitro selection, these molecules can specifically target and recognise certain cells or membrane proteins and have currently been employed for selective delivery of various drugs and treatments, including CRISPR/Cas9 [58,59].",
              "In one study, ssDNA aptamers specific to osteosarcoma cells were used to create aptamer-guided lipopolymers containing plasmids with Cas9 and sgRNA targeting the VEGFA gene [60].",

              "Over the past 20 years, researchers have used genetic engineering to create mouse models by deleting tumor suppressor genes or activating cancer-promoting genes.",

              "Some of this work occurred in Jacks\u2019 lab, where Sa\u0301nchez-Rivera (then an MIT graduate student) and his colleagues showed that they could use CRISPR to quickly and easily knock out genes that are often lost in tumors.",
              "However, while this approach makes it easy to knock out genes, it doesn\u2019t lend itself to inserting new mutations into a gene because it relies on the cell\u2019s DNA repair mechanisms, which tend to introduce errors.",
              "Inspired by research from Liu\u2019s lab at the Broad Institute, the MIT team wanted to come up with a way to perform more precise gene-editing that would allow them to make very targeted mutations to either oncogenes (genes that drive cancer) or tumor suppressors.",
              "In 2019, Liu and colleagues reported a new version of CRISPR genome-editing called prime editing.",
              "Unlike the original version of CRISPR, which uses an enzyme called Cas9 to create double-stranded breaks in DNA, prime editing uses a modified enzyme called Cas9 nickase, which is fused to another enzyme called reverse transcriptase.",
              "This fusion enzyme cuts only one strand of the DNA helix, which avoids introducing double-stranded DNA breaks that can lead to errors when the cell repairs the DNA.",
              "The MIT researchers designed their new mouse models by engineering the gene for the prime editor enzyme into the germline cells of the mice, which means that it will be present in every cell of the organism.",

              "The RNA guide can be designed to induce single DNA base substitutions, deletions, or additions in a specified gene, allowing the researchers to create any cancer mutation they wish.",

              "However, not all Kras mutations are identical.",
              "Many Kras mutations occur at a location known as G12, where the amino acid glycine is found, and depending on the mutation, this glycine can be converted into one of several different amino acids.",

              "For example, G12R mutations produced large, aggressive lung tumors, while G12A tumors were smaller and progressed more slowly.",
              "Learning more about how these mutations affect tumor development differently could help researchers develop drugs that target each of the different mutations.",
              "Currently, there are only two FDA-approved drugs that target Kras mutations, and they are both specific to the G12C mutation, which accounts for about 30 percent of the Kras mutations seen in lung cancer.",
              "The researchers also used their technique to create pancreatic organoids with several different types of mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53, and they are now developing mouse models of these mutations.",

              "DNA recombination techniques were used extensively in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 8 , 9 beginning in the early 1980s, allowing researchers to study functional eukaryotic genomics.",
              "And in a significant advancement, the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allowed scientists to amplify DNA, producing millions of copies from a single strand.",
              "10 Around the same time, a number of laboratories created the first transgenic mice, 11 and about five years later, the first knockout mice were created.",
              "12 Targeted gene editing was further advanced by the discovery that engineered endonucleases could create site\u2010specific double\u2010stranded breaks (DSBs), which in turn induce homologous recombination (HR), 13 , 15 the most common type of homology\u2010directed repair (HDR).",

              "For example, these molecules can be combined with endonucleases, creating DSBs which can be repaired using either nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which often results in small random indel mutations, or HDR, which, when donor DNA with homology to either side of the cleavage site is present, can be used to create new or \u201crepaired\u201d versions of a target gene.",

              "17 This class of proteins is now referred to as zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), and several similar proteins have been discovered in the proteomes of a number of different organisms. Because each zinc finger recognizes three base pairs, 18 , 19 , 20 a peptide can be created to recognize a target gene by joining the appropriate zinc fingers in a linear fashion.",
              "A 1994 paper describes a ZFP that was engineered to recognize and suppress an oncogene, as well as a ZFP that acted (in a different cell system) as a promoter of another gene by recognizing its activation domain.",
              "21 The same paper suggests that ZFPs can be bound to effector proteins as a means of controlling gene expression.",
              "Building on this idea, researchers fused a ZFP to the nonspecific cleavage domain of the Fok1 restriction enzyme.",
              "22 The resulting heterodimer, known as a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), can recognize a specific DNA sequence and produce a targeted DSB.",
              "As previously mentioned, these DSB can either be repaired via NHEJ, resulting in small indels, or HDR, which can be harnessed to insert an alternate or repaired gene.",
              "Fok1 must dimerize, so ZFNs must be created in pairs (one targeting the 3\u2019 strand and the other targeting the 5\u2019 strand) which improves target specificity\u2014though efficiency remains relatively low (G\u2010rich sequences are especially difficult to target).",
              "Ex vivo and in vivo delivery of ZFNs is relatively easy given their small size and the small size of the ZFN cassettes (which allows for the use of a variety of vectors).",

              "In 2009, two different laboratories described a newly identified DNA\u2010binding motif: the transcription activator\u2010like effector (TALE), a protein secreted by the plant pathogen Xanthomonas.",
              "23 , 24 Each TALE includes a DNA\u2010binding region composed of tandem repeats with repeat\u2010variable diresidues (RVDs) at positions 12 and 13;",

              "as with ZFNs, because Fok1 is the endonuclease used, TALENs must be created in pairs.",
              "TALE nucleases are much larger than ZFNs, and so can be more difficult to deliver efficiently (especially in vivo).",
              "However, for myriad reasons (including the nature of their relative interactions with the DNA and the fact that each RVD recognizes a single base), TALE\u2010based chimeras (especially TALENs) can be built with higher specificity and greater targeting capacity than ZFP\u2010based chimeras.",
              "In addition, TALENs can be produced significantly more cheaply, easily, and with greater efficiency than ZFNs.",

              "After the CRISPR genes are transcribed, endoribonucleases cleave the resulting CRISPR RNA (pre\u2010crRNA), resulting in shorter RNA units composed of a single spacer sequence and the palindromic repeat (crRNA);",

              "in this case, the impaired Cas9 is fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase.",
              "46 ZFNs and TALENs do maintain some advantages: CRISPR requires a PAM sequence, and sgRNA spacer sequences are usually only about 20 base pairs, meaning an inherently reduced targeting capacity (though researchers have recently begun exploring the effects of increased sgRNA length on cleavage efficiency and target specificity 47 ).",
              "CRISPR vectors are also necessary larger, making delivery more difficult.",
              "Overall, however, CRISPR is generally the preferred method of genetic and epigenetic manipulation, especially as improvements are made to the technology.",
              "CRISPR\u2019s main advantage over its predecessors lies in the fact that rather than a complex protein as the DNA recognition molecule, the CRISPR system relies on a guide RNA.",

              "An international moratorium has been advocated.",
              "We examine the practicality of such a proposal, as well as of a regulation through the \u201ctraditional\u201d mechanisms of international and municipal laws.",
              "We argue that these mechanisms are unlikely to achieve their intended objectives and that the better approach is to engage the international community of stakeholders, researchers, scientists, clinicians, and other workers directly involved in the field in working toward the development of an \u201cinformed adaptive consensus\u201d.",
              "We offer suggestions as to how this may be achieved and how existing indirect levers of regulation may be harnessed toward this end.",
              "Since He Jiankui\u2019s revelations in 2018, there have been calls for an international moratorium on human germline genome editing (HGGE) [1].",
              "The relative technical ease with which clinical applications of HGGE can now be performed, which, for the purposes of this section, includes clinical research such as first in human trials, brings to the fore difficult ethical, legal, and social questions about how it should be appropriately regulated.",
              "In many countries, this is already directly or indirectly regulated, generally, through the licensing regime for artificial reproductive technologies [2].",
              "Here, we aim to show first why some approaches to the regulation of HGGE would be ineffective and then identify what may be required for the successful establishment of a regulatory regime or professional guidance for HGGE.",
              "There is a pressing need to provide an understanding of the legal and regulatory environment in plain language so that scientists are well informed, given that they are likely participants in broader developments in this field, and there is an even greater pressing need to dispassionately consider solutions that will promote legally, ethically, and socially prudent actions.",
              "We argue that none of these mechanisms alone will achieve their proposed objectives: They themselves are fraught with difficulties relating to enforcement, harmonization, and consistency of regulatory objectives between countries, especially given the need to maintain the appropriate but difficult balance between encouraging and guiding ethical scientific endeavors for the benefit of humankind, while at the same time discouraging or restricting research or clinical applications for which there is a general international consensus that such research or clinical applications are unethical or pose unacceptable and currently unknowable dangers for humanity as a whole.",
              "Scientists (and other stakeholders) have a key role to play in the development of these technologies.",
              "Instead of focusing on building high walls to contain bad actors, the collateral damage of which is to raise the administrative bar for ethical and beneficial research, and to discourage such research, scientists need to think in terms of how we can devise responsive structures that will support, guide, and encourage ethical and beneficial endeavors in this area while discouraging the dubious.",
              "Just as it is their professional and ethical responsibility to speak out if they believe that a particular line of research is not in the public interest, or is unethical (or both), we assert that if scientists believe that particular lines of HGGE can be ethically carried out with potential promise to humankind, they should likewise state their conscience.",
              "In other words, these scientists need to be advocates for the potential benefit to humanity of their work and to focus the lay mind and media on the positive and not the negative.",
              "During the publication of this work, the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Advisory Committee on Developing Global Standards for Governance and Oversight of Human Genome Editing released its governance framework [3] and accompanying recommendations [4].",
              "The proposal we make in this work is in alignment with these recommendations, but, in this work, we are more specifically focused on the governance challenges of germline editing.",
              "We hope that these cumulative efforts will pave the way for greater national and international understanding and collaboration.",
              "Ethical and scientific views evolve with technology over time [5]: Given the early and rapid state of the development of the technology, a mature body of ethical and scientific consensus is currently a moving target, for which legal regulation through municipal law (i.",
              "e., national and other domestic laws such as state or regional laws) is neither appropriate nor practical.",
              "There is also the serious danger that early regulation implemented in the form of hard municipal law will have the effect of ossifying a developing consensus at an intermediate stage of development and stunt ethical research and potentially valuable scientific advances.",
              "We suggest that the best way forward is to rally the international scientific community toward the formulation of a scientific and ethical consensus on what may be acceptable (or otherwise) at any given time in the development of the technology.",
              "We envisage that the stakeholders to such a consensus recognize that it is a consensus that is not a fixed one, but one that develops and changes over time in response to new advances and knowledge, i.",
              "e., an \u201cinformed adaptive consensus\u201d.",
              "The development of such a flexible and responsive scientific and ethical consensus (and just as importantly, the debate that informs it) will also serve the invaluable office of providing assurance and guidance to scientists who are concerned about the ethics of their research in this area.",
              "To this end, we explore and suggest avenues for harnessing currently available levers of indirect regulation that can be used to give real teeth to such an international consensus.",
              "Finally, we suggest that with this approach, a truly mature and stable ethical and scientific consensus will come about, which can serve the purpose of guiding governments toward informed and harmonized national legislation.",
              "Here, we clarify that \u201cinformed adaptive consensus\u201d is not to be confused with \u201cbroad societal consensus\u201d, which refers to all of society, including lay people.",
              "We have critiqued the use of this latter concept in Xafis and colleagues [6], as it erroneously conveys the notion that all of society can be included when, in fact, much of the world is necessarily excluded due to inequitable life circumstances.",
              "The establishment of a moratorium would require a number of features to be addressed explicitly.",
              "These include the exact substance of the moratorium, i.",
              "e., what exactly is to be prohibited and what may be permitted, particularly in exceptional circumstances.",
              "It would also require the exact juridical, ethical, and legal bases and objectives for the moratorium as well as the term of the moratorium.",
              "In relation to the latter, by definition, a moratorium is a temporary suspension of an otherwise permitted activity.",
              "Moratoriums are therefore articulated for either fixed terms, usually with a clause allowing for extension by agreement, or predicated upon an event/circumstance that would trigger its determination or dissolution.",
              "In defining the trigger or determination event (if the moratorium were not to be for a renewable fixed term), justifications would have to be advanced for putting forward the proposed trigger or determination event and how this might serve the bases and objectives of the moratorium.",
              "As a result of this key feature of moratoriums, any notion of a permanent or open-ended moratorium cannot hold.",
              "The final feature of moratoriums relates to the likely efficacy and impact of the proposed measure.",
              "Given the sovereign state principle in international law (i.",
              "e., that states have exclusive sovereignty over their territory), a moratorium would need to address issues regarding its ability to have real effect because, if it did not, it would simply result in another ineffectual political expression of intent.",
              "Additional considerations regarding its effect relate to a number of critically important considerations.",
              "The foremost among these is the \u201cbottom-of-the-barrel\u201d scenario\u2014countries signing up to such a moratorium may find researchers moving off to more receptive climes with more \u201cliberal\u201d regulatory regimes with less oversight and restrictions.",
              "Would overly broad regulation or direction have a chilling effect on useful research in allied areas through discouraging researchers, for example, as a result of high administrative burdens, too many added complicated procedures, and having to put forward levels of justifications not required in other areas of research?",
              "Finally, most researchers would want to avoid the taint of unfounded \u201cassociation by guilt\u201d by a public or press that does not understand the vital difference between their work and that sought to be regulated.",
              "One approach is to rely on individual states to regulate at the national level through municipal legislation.",
              "However, this option does not necessarily promote the cause of international harmonization: In an ideal world, municipal law enacted by countries would be harmonized in the sense that they are at least roughly consistent with each other and have similarly common objectives.",
              "A detailed survey of the regulatory mechanisms in 18 countries found that while there is generally a ban on clinical applications of HGGE, some of these bans are not absolute, while other rules are \u201cvague and fail to provide clear guidance as to what is allowed\u201d ([7], p.",
              "139).",
              "The lack of international harmonization is problematic;",
              "given the experience of human embryonic stem cell research, research resources may tend to eventually concentrate in jurisdictions that take a more relaxed or supportive approach to such research.",
              "Hence, safety and ethical concerns relating to genome editing are not adequately addressed with this option.",
              "The greatest drawback of relying on municipal law at this stage is that there is no general clear consensus on precisely what should or should not be permitted in the name of research and in clinical application currently or in the future.",
              "The reality is that it is such early days yet in HGGE technology that we cannot know, or be agreed upon, from the ethical, social, as well as the scientific perspective, what kind of restrictive measures we want carved in legislative stone at this stage of development.",
              "Ideally, municipal law should reflect an established and mature body of ethical and scientific consensus, but the argument may be that we are currently just opening the debate and far from reaching any mature body of consensus.",
              "The act of legislation in most countries is ultimately at heart a political act\u2014ethics and science may inform or be used to drive the legislative debate, but neither have an assured or primary place at the table.",
              "Legislators are first and foremost politicians: Science (and sometimes ethics) are often not the controlling premises for their actions.",
              "In its most innocent and defensible aspect, this political ranking of priorities may instead prioritize deeply held popular religious perspectives and economic and national interests in preserving the scientific advantages in a given field already established by the scientific or academic community in the country.",
              "Once enacted, the regulatory regime tends to ossify and be set in stone\u2014repealing, or amending or \u201cbringing up to date\u201d a law that attracts strong political views on opposing sides of the legislative chamber may prove to be just as difficult as enacting it in the first place, particularly given the nature of HGGE, in which religious sentiments are likely to be a prominent theme in the public debate in some countries.",
              "Likewise, the disadvantages of overly precipitate and premature legislation based on an incomplete state of scientific knowledge are obvious.",
              "Another approach may be to work toward the promulgation of international norms in an international treaty or instrument regulating the research and clinical use of HGGE.",
              "Again, as for muncipal law, the main obstacle to this normative approach is the current lack of consensus on the ethical, legal, and social dimensions of HGGE and how this may be best regulated and directed.",
              "A fundamental plank of international law is that all states are sovereign and equal, as enshrined in Article 2 of the United Nations (UN) Charter, which declares that \u201cthe Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.",
              "\u201d This basically means that, with a very few exceptions (such as security matters within the purview of the Security Council when acting against another state, or crimes against humanity when acting against individual citizens of other states), no country is entitled to impress its law or will against another (in theory anyway).",
              "In short, countries are free to exercise their sovereign right to refuse to play in accordance with rules unpalatable to them.",
              "Even when countries accede to a treaty, they are, in most cases, free to withdraw at any time.",
              "Even if, in fact, a country signs up to a treaty, it does not mean that the obligations and provisions of the treaty automatically become translated directly into municipal law enforceable by the municipal judicial authorities (unresolved international jurisprudential debates about whether monism (which postulates that once a country signs up to a treaty, the provisions of that external treaty automatically become part of the body of municipal law) or dualism (in which the provisions of the treaty have to be specifically translated into municipal law by the national legislature before it has any municipal effect) should be applied to international law in its relation to municipal law date back to the earliest roots of the concept of international law).",
              "It suffices to say, for our present purposes, that there is no jurisprudential agreement on this matter, and different countries take different (and, often, mixed and complexly nuanced) perspectives.",
              "And if a dualist country refuses to implement its international obligations under the treaty, in most cases, there is little that other countries can do\u2014again, this is the sovereignty doctrine at work.",
              "But as the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) experience in the Declaration on Human Cloning amply demonstrates, the biggest obstacle in the way of a clear international treaty or instrument is the simple lack of agreement currently on what should be restricted (or what should be restricted in the way of research or in clinical applications), as well as the very different competing interests and first premises that different countries may bring to the debate.",
              "Many of those countries that refused to sign up to the Declaration on Human Cloning had communities of scientists already engaged in advanced research that would have been affected by the Declaration;",
              "for other countries, religious perspectives on human cloning and human embryonic stem cell research were the principal driving forces for their national positions on the debate.",
              "Similar divergences are likely to appear for HGGE.",
              "Finally, the length of time required to negotiate and ratify an international agreement risks rendering the content of the agreement \u201cobsolete\u201d by the end of this process due to the rapid scientific developments.",
              "Governance mechanisms need to be adaptable and responsive, as highlighted in the recent WHO framework [3].",
              "This requirement is a fundamental driver of an informed adaptive consensus, as it supports such responsiveness.",
              "It is often tempting to turn to law (whether municipal or international) to regulate spheres of human endeavor.",
              "But, instead of using the blunt and inflexible instrument of the formal law, working toward the establishment of a body of international norms outside of formal treaties may be an approach that can be used to address the tension between the need for international harmonization and the difficulty in making legally binding international law.",
              "This is in line with the trend since the start of the 21st century where international cooperation has moved away from legally binding international laws to nonlegally binding instruments [8].",
              "In recent decades, we have seen the establishment or development of a consensus of norms in new and rapidly developing areas of biomedical technology and biomedical research that do not rely on harnessing the mechanisms of formal international law.",
              "Examples of such an approach include the following: A key limitation of regulatory initiatives in both the international and municipal legal spheres is that only a very limited number of key stakeholders have a direct hand in the shaping of regulations.",
              "In the case of municipal law, legislators not only have a primarily political focus, but are usually also far removed from the actual experience and practice of the science involved, so that both the ethical as well as the scientific implications of developments must be received secondhand from the primary experts.",
              "At best, there is a risk of distortion or imperfect translation in such transmission;",
              "at worst, there is the possibility of deliberately slanted perspectives by less than scientifically objective experts.",
              "The ongoing political struggles over whether lockdowns are justified in the current pandemic is a painful reminder of such a reality.",
              "Likewise, the general rule in interstate relations is that only state actors are entitled to a place at the table: All other parties (such as nongovernmental entities or UN agencies) are permitted a peek in only on sufferance or agreement by the state actors concerned.",
              "But, in the initiatives that we have identified above, the fundamental principle is maximum inclusivity of the stakeholders most relevant to the issue at stake: participation of the many who are directly involved, and who have the greatest expertise, instead of a few far removed from the actual practice and impact of the science.",
              "To this end, these initiatives have been deliberately fashioned outside of the established mechanisms for the creation of international law, and they demonstrate that state actors are not the only stakeholders who may influence or contribute to shaping the rules.",
              "The creation and willing uptake of these and other comparable initiatives illustrate that the views of academia, industry, patient lobbies, public interest groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders exert influence and contribute in substantial ways to developing outputs likely to be palatable to a broader audience because they tend to be a product of consensus.",
              "There is, however, always an inherent risk in attempting to reach too widely for a consensus, as the result may be settling for a less meaningful lower common denominator.",
              "In the HGGE space, entities with gatekeeping powers capable of considerable influence include biotechnology companies and fertility clinics, which have the power to refrain from offering products or services that are ethically problematic or likely to be used in an ethically problematic way;",
              "universities, funding foundations, international consortia and organizations, and WHO itself are other such entities.",
              "In addition, the top scientific and medical journals wield enormous normative power and influence in the shaping of norms through requirements they implement, as shown above.",
              "Gatekeepers such as professional bodies, scientists, and clinicians who are directly involved in the field are especially well positioned to understand which approaches are likely to result in the best outcomes.",
              "We believe that we should do more to explore working through nongovernmental gatekeepers such as those identified here.",
              "This approach also appears to be partially explored and supported in the recent NASEM report on HGGE [16] and is also supported in the newly released WHO framework [3].",
              "In sum, we propose that nonlegally binding instruments are the most promising approach to international governance of HGGE.",
              "One of the most important advantages of adopting such an approach that stresses the participation and product of the many, instead of the few, is that the product is one that is constantly being refined and articulated to address and reflect scientific developments as and when they appear: It is a gradual and flexible process in which international (as opposed to merely municipal) consensus can be gradually built up.",
              "In coming to an international consensus with their peers abroad, communities of scientists within a given country are also thereby afforded greater credibility than if they were lobbying alone with their national politicians.",
              "Politicians are also thereby quickly made aware of likely policy directions in competing jurisdictions.",
              "Non-state actors and participants directly involved in the science can move much more quickly and more expertly to formulate draft guidelines than legislators and state actors relying on secondhand information and bound by the rules of municipal and diplomatic protocols.",
              "In this way, scientists and ethicists alike can seize the initiative and provide guidance for the eventual formulation of municipal regulation, rather than the other way around.",
              "International and municipal laws have a place when the core consensus has been achieved and when the body of international expert opinion on the way forward is reasonably mature.",
              "Until then, all involved in science and ethics should consider what informal levers of power may be available to them and how these may be used to lead responsibly and ethically.",
              "A decision to halt any and all involvement in HGGE via a moratorium is not prudent, as it would delay the hard work we will ultimately have to engage in to find prudent solutions, and, importantly, it would bring to a halt an area of science that may have much to offer future generations.",

              "Why Include the Public in Genome Editing Governance Deliberation ...",
              "With the birth of genetically engineered twins in November 2018, international debate about human genome editing governance has moved from an emphasis on mutual engagement among multiple stakeholders to a self-regulatory model enacted through high-level expert groups with little or no public input.",
              "This article reconstructs this paradigm shift and suggests that inclusive public deliberation should still have a role in public decision making about genome editing.",
              "In 2015, the first attempt to use CRISPR/Cas9\u2014the newest and most efficient genetic engineering technique1\u2014to modify human embryos2 gave rise to intense ethical debate.",
              "In response to this experiment, the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), along with the Royal Society and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, convened the International Summit on Human Gene Editing in Washington, DC, in December 2015.",
              "3 This summit, while attended mostly by scientists, also included ethicists, social scientists, and patient advocates from around the globe.",
              "On November 25, 2018, the announcement of the births of twin girls in China carrying a CRISPR-modified version of the CCR5 gene4 (intended to improve resistance to HIV infection) marked a turning point in debate about genome editing governance.",
              "Emphasis on interdisciplinary dialogue and stakeholder engagement started to wane as high-level expert groups were set up in an effort to tame unethical uses of genome editing.",
              "The international summit of December 2015 was an initial attempt to keep the discussion about human genome editing thematically broad and open to input from a variety of stakeholders.",
              "Such an inclusive stance had been advanced by many and its need was widely recognized.",
              "For instance, in a perspective in Science, David Baltimore and colleagues recommended creating interdisciplinary forums of scientists and bioethicists to inform the public about gene editing.",
              "They encouraged forming \u201ca globally representative group of developers and users of genome engineering technology and experts in genetics, law, and bioethics, as well as members of the scientific community, the public, and relevant government agencies and interest groups\u201d to consider technical and ethical questions about genome editing and to recommend policies.",
              "5 Others, including Sheila Jasanoff and colleagues, criticized this model because, despite its proclaimed openness, it nonetheless reproduced an expert-centric, technocratic form of discussion and decision making about matters of common concern.",
              "6 Only inclusive deliberation can confer democratic legitimacy on decisions that can affect the future of humanity.",
              "In 2017, a NASEM report titled Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance7 seemed to acknowledge this criticism and included a set of recommendations regarding public engagement in genome editing governance.",
              "In particular, the report suggested \u201cextensive and inclusive public participation\u201d before launching clinical trials that have an enhancement rather than a therapeutic aim (for example, a clinical trial testing an intervention to confer resistance to an infectious disease or to improve a specific phenotypic trait) or studies that would result in heritable germline modifications.",
              "The report also recommended public participation in policymaking about human genome editing and encouraged funding agencies to support additional research on effective forms of public engagement.",
              "These recommendations resonate with Jasanoff\u2019s view that \u201cgood governance depends on visions of progress that are collectively defined, drawing on the full richness of the democratic imagination.",
              "\u201d6 After the births of 2 so-called CRISPR babies in November 2018, debate about gene editing governance changed.",
              "A prominent group of scientists and bioethicists called for a temporary global moratorium on heritable genome editing to allow time to develop an international governance framework and to foster discussion about ethical and technical questions.",
              "8 The NASEM and the Royal Society formed an International Commission on the Clinical Use of Human Germline Genome Editing.",
              "9 In March 2019, the World Health Organization also established an international expert panel to develop governance standards.",
              "10 A post-2018 trend toward delegating deliberative responsibility to expert groups, while laudable in its intention to tame rogue clinical uses of genome editing, marks a departure from ideals\u2014albeit never actually realized\u2014of openness, inclusion, and public engagement that were proposed prior to 2018.",
              "Such ideals are now presented abstractly as a need for \u201cbroad societal consensus\u201d before nations authorize ethically controversial uses of genome editing techniques.",
              "8 Increasing reliance on expert groups suggests trust in science\u2019s self-regulatory capacity, even in the absence of input and support from other sectors of society.",
              "Self-regulation, however, might not be up to the tasks of a thematically broad governance agenda.",
              "At the 1975 Asilomar Conference on recombinant DNA technology, for instance, experts offered only a narrow understanding of technical risks and ethical stakes of genetic engineering by focusing on safety and harm containment, while sidelining fundamental ethical questions about humanity\u2019s capacity to collectively bear responsibility for the use of transformative technologies.",
              "11 What is more, stressing scientific and social consensus as a condition of legitimate use of genome editing can be misleading.",
              "The fact that people agree on a given course of action does not imply that their agreement is ethically right.",

              "The key arguments presented supporting this view are: (i) the limited value of a genetic trait in respect to the life of an embryo (Parens and Asch, 2000) and (ii) the \u2018expressivist\u2019 argument (Buchanan, 1996;",

              "The second, the \u2018expressivist\u2019 argument, argues that the use of these technologies expresses negative or discriminatory views on the disabling conditions they are targeting and subsequently on the people living with these conditions (Asch and Wasserman, 2015).",
              "The expressivist argument, however, has been challenged by stressing the importance of differentiating between the disability itself and the people living with disability (Savulescu, 2001).",
              "The technology\u2019s use is aimed at reducing the incidence of disability, and it does not have a position of value on the people that have a specific condition.",

              "However, it is worth exploring whether scientific innovations like HGE are either ameliorating or reinvigorating ethical concerns expressed so far, for example in creating a future that respects or devalues disability as a part of the human condition.",
              "Perhaps even more importantly, given their potential spectrum of possible intervention and efficacy, it is important to reflect on whether the broad use of HGE could have an impact on concepts of disability and \u2018normality\u2019 as a whole distorting an already unclear ethical line between clinical and non-clinical interventions.",

              "How exactly off-target effects and genetic mosaicism would manifest in future generations, is almost impossible to predict which makes this risk incalculable.",

              "One of these concerns is the effect of GGE on the population level (The National Academies 2017).",
              "Since germ cells are altered, the modified genes could be passed on to future generations (Ormond et al.",
              "2017).",
              "Thus, the modified genes could spread within the human gene pool with yet unforeseeable consequences.",

              "Similarly, there may be as yet unknown positive effects to genes ordinarily considered pathogenic.",
              "On the other hand, modified genes which appear not to affect its carrier may turn out to be pathogenic over time.",
              "This aggravates safety concerns, since not only one individual, but many individuals or whole populations might be affected by possible pathogenic effects of the modified genes.",
              "Due to the complexity of gene frequency and microevolution, it is impossible to manage or even predict the impact of modified genes in future generations.",
              "Another topic in the discussion is the specific way in which the human genome is altered through GGE.",
              "Some state that GGE implies a new level of interfering with nature that is to be considered as irresponsible.",
              "Therefore, the procedure crosses a line that should not be crossed (Lanphier et al.",

              "This would challenge the very ideas of justice and equality which are crucial to modern society.",
              "But there are also those that consider the implementation of GGE as ethically justified.",
              "Supporters of GGE see benefits of the method in two areas, disease prevention and infertility treatment (Gyngell et al.",

              "2015).",

              "They could fulfil their wish to have children without the risk of severe health conditions or ailments.",
              "So far, couples with genetic risk depend on embryo selection, gamete donation, or adoption.",
              "Embryo selection, mostly through PGD, can be applied in certain cases to ensure that a certain genetic trait is not passed on.",
              "The method is elaborate, costly and often stressful for patients.",
              "It also implies the discarding of embryos with unwanted traits which is ethically questionable.",
              "Also, there are cases of dominant late-onset conditions like Huntington\u2019s where a selection of embryos by using PGD is not possible.",
              "Thus, GGE could be used to prevent offspring from inheriting pathogenic genes.",
              "Apart from disease prevention, GGE is also presented as a potential infertility treatment.",
              "One possible application is non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) in male patients (Vij et al.",

              "So far, the only option for these patients to create offspring is through gamete donation.",
              "When it comes to gamete donation, legal restraints have to be considered apart from the effort and ethical implications.",
              "Since gamete donation is legally prohibited in many countries, the treatment is not always available.",
              "It furthermore implies that that the resulting child is not genetically related to both of the partners that apply the method.",
              "The fact that the genetic material of another individual is used conflicts with the wish for a child that is genetically related to both partners.",
              "Also, when it comes to adoption, this issue is to be considered.",
              "The wish for a child implies a child that is genetically related to both partners for most couples.",
              "Genetic relatedness, however, cannot be provided by adoption.",
              "GGE could be a viable alternative to PGD, gamete donation, and adoption.",
              "It circumvents the ethical and legal implications of these options by making a healthy genetically-related child a possibility for potential parents.",
              "As Gyngell et al.",
              "(2017) claim, for some reproduction partners GGE would be the only option to create offspring that is genetically related to both.",
              "It is, however, contestable that genetic relatedness is a strong argument for allowing genetic modifications (Baylis 2013).",
              "Following the supporters of GGE, editing the germline would also provide benefits on a population level (Powell 2015).",
              "Correcting a pathogenic genetic mutation in the germ cells of an individual patient means that the genetic errors disappear from the germline.",
              "Thus, the mutation is prevented from spreading within the gene pool of a given population.",
              "Disease prevention would benefit future generations, in addition to the individual affected by the application of GGE.",
              "This public health benefit has led to the call for a genome-wise program of GGE (Powell 2015).",
              "And this argument suggests that we are morally obliged to improve health outcomes for future generations.",
              "In addition, the implementation of a large-scale program would lead to an eventual decrease in healthcare costs.",
              "Taken in its totality, supporters of GGE claim that in the light of its public health benefits, this pursuit should be regarded as a moral imperative (Gyngell et al.",
              "2017).",
              "In order to decide whether the expected benefits of GGE outweigh the risks, we have to analyze the arguments brought forward by opponents and supporters of the method.",
              "The argument that implementing GGE means interfering with nature and therefore crossing a line that should not be crossed is not well-founded, since modern medicine implies interfering with nature on many levels already.",
              "As long as security standards are followed, there is no reason why interfering with nature for medical purposes should be prohibited in this specific context when it is accepted and well-established in others.",
              "Apart from medical risks, which clearly have to be diminished through further research, opponents of GGE also identify societal risks.",
              "The main societal risk is seen in the possible misuse of GGE for non-medically indicated purposes such as genetic enhancement.",
              "There is an ongoing debate whether genetic enhancement is ethically acceptable.",
              "This an issue that surely needs a focused analysis that cannot be given here.",
              "Apart from the question, whether we should accept genetic enhancement as such, there is the argument that neither our societies nor our legal frameworks are prepared for its impact (Lanphier et al.",
              "2015).",
              "However, we are already taking precautions against the enhancing use of reproductive technologies.",

              "An analogous legal framework for GGE could be created.",
              "This can be considered as a practical argument following which the possibility of genetic enhancement is not a strong argument against GGE because it can be regulated when needed.",
              "Rules and regulations could be implemented in order to guarantee that GGE is only used in medically indicated cases.",
              "The differences between the cases do not only result from the nature of the procedure applied, but also from the moral status of the agent involved.",
              "Whether a medical intervention is to be considered as treatment or enhancement depends on the specific circumstances of the case.",
              "Each case where GGE is applied would have to be evaluated by an ethics committee, since there is no overall criterion to separate treatment from enhancement.",
              "This would have to be a case-to-case decision.",
              "Thus, the argument following which the risk of misuse of GGE is too high has to be considered as non-convincing.",
              "When considering the arguments in favor of GGE, we find that main benefit of GGE is seen in disease prevention for monogenic diseases (Gyngell et al.",

              "The matter is more complex, however, when we deal with zygotes.",
              "The edited zygote is only created because of the availability of GGE.",
              "The fact that GGE is available is the only reason a couple with pathogenic traits decides to create a zygote that is then immediately edited, thus producing an embryo without the pathogenic genetic trait.",
              "In other words, a zygote with a genetic defect is knowingly created in order to be edited at once.",
              "By stretching the boundaries of the term, this therapeutic procedure may also have the effect of disease prevention, particularly at the population level.",
              "The challenge here is the status of the zygote.",
              "If one considers the zygote as an individual, the term therapy may apply.",
              "If one considers the zygote as eukaryotic, diploid cell, it is unproblematic to call GGE disease prevention, since, analogous to sperm cell and oocyte-editing, a future individual is prevented from inheriting a monogenic disease.",
              "Given this definition, the term therapy would be misleading.",
              "The term therapy could only be used if an in vivo application of GGE was possible.",
              "Imagine the case where a life-threatening genetic defect is detected in an embryo in the womb by using prenatal genetic diagnosis.",
              "If GGE was applied here, given the technical feasibility which is unavailable at the moment, then we would deal with a life-saving therapy.",
              "Another possibility would be to classify GGE as an elaborate procedure of ART which is to fulfil one\u2019s wish to have a child.",
              "Both reproduction partners know about their genetic conditions.",
              "They know that if they reproduce, their offspring could inherit a pathogenic trait.",
              "Instead of using alternatives like gamete donation or adoption, they decide to create a zygote with the pathogenic trait that is altered afterwards.",
              "That means that there was no immediate need for intervening in the genome in the first place.",
              "These terminological issues may seem purely academic, but they may shape the development of clinical practice.",
              "Given a publicly funded healthcare system, it is to be expected that the question, whether or not GGE should be covered by the public health scheme, will arise.",
              "Usually, methods of disease prevention and therapeutic measures are covered by the public health scheme, whereas not all procedures of ART are financed by the public.",
              "In this regard, it may become important to clarify the status of GGE.",
              "As noted, GGE could also be used as a means of disease prevention on a population level.",
              "However, it is doubtful how a large-scale use of GGE should be implemented without coercive measures.",
              "In order to be thoroughly effective, GGE may have to be mandatory for all carriers of certain genetic traits who want to reproduce.",
              "That such a coercive, if not eugenic, measure would be implemented seems rather unlikely.",
              "Therefore, disease prevention on a population level may at most be considered as a side effect of GGE.",
              "It follows from our analysis that we can identify three types of risks: Firstly, there is a medical risk for the child that is created through GGE.",
              "Off-target effects and mosaicism are the crucial risk factors here.",
              "These risks are still prevalent despite recent refinement of GGE procedures.",
              "We are usually willing to take certain risks when a new method can be used to treat or prevent diseases that have so far been untreatable.",
              "As we have seen, the National Academies in the United States have suggested translational research on GGE which aims at a preventive use in cases of severe disease or disability where no alternative methods exist (The National Academies 2017).",
              "If we consider GGE as a possible means of disease prevention (notwithstanding the terminological difficulties outlined above), there are certain cases that fulfill these conditions, i.",
              "e. monogenic diseases like Huntington\u2019s.",
              "Since these conditions are usually severe and since there are no treatment alternatives, translational research efforts are justified.",
              "The same holds for infertility treatment.",
              "GGE is a promising method that allows couples with a known genetic risk to create healthy offspring that is genetically related to both partners.",
              "It can be used as an infertility treatment in cases where a genetic defect leads to infertile oocytes or sperm cells.",
              "As an assisted reproduction technology, GGE is certainly an alternative to available methods.",
              "It renders gamete donation obsolete and allows infertile partners to have a child that is genetically related to both of them.",
              "Regarding both disease prevention and infertility treatment, the main goal of the translational research will have to be the reduction of off-target effects and genetic mosaicism.",
              "However, it will be difficult to decide when an acceptable level of risk is reached.",
              "Whether the benefits outweigh the risks in this regard, however, depends on the outcome of future translational research.",
              "Secondly, there is a medical risk for future generations.",
              "Since interventions in the germline mean that the modified genetic trait is passed on, errors in editing may have negative effects on future individuals.",
              "It is extremely difficult to predict which consequences genetic mosaicism for example will generate in one individual.",
              "It is even harder, if not impossible to foresee the effects in two or three generations.",
              "It is doubtful, whether further research will be useful here since effects on whole populations and in future generations are very difficult, if not impossible to model.",
              "However, if we consider that only a few individuals will use GGE, the risks at the level of the population must be put into perspective.",
              "The number of GGE-treatments might be small enough as to have no effect on the genome of a whole population (The National Academies 2017).",
              "Thirdly, there are societal risks.",
              "GGE could be used for non-medically indicated purposes, first and foremost genetic enhancement.",
              "The majority considers genetic enhancement as a societal hazard because it may compromise social justice and equality.",
              "However, this slippery-slope-argument suggests that the non-medically indicated use of GGE is a necessary consequence of its clinical implementation.",
              "This does not have to be the case since it is possible to create guidelines and regulations before GGE is implemented.",
              "This implies an intense ethical, legal, and public debate.",
              "Since the societal risks are manageable, they do not outweigh the benefits.",
              "GGE offers promising possibilities for disease prevention and infertility treatment.",
              "The technique has been improved immensely in recent years and its medical risks have diminished.",
              "GGE might therefore be safe enough to be implemented in the clinic in the near future.",
              "Societal risk can easily be managed by implementing a regulative framework that limits GGE to medically-indicated uses.",
              "However, the effects of modified genes within the gene pool of a given population are unforeseeable and uncontrollable.",
              "It is almost impossible to predict which impact these modifications will have in future generations.",
              "When it comes to weighing risks and benefits, the question of scale is an important point.",
              "Given the treatment of one individual, we have sufficient data to assess the risks, e.",
              "g. for off-target mutations.",
              "This assessment becomes more difficult on a societal level, but is still possible, as long as a broad public debate takes place.",
              "But it is hard to see how such an assessment should be possible when the data simply cannot be retrieved sufficiently.",
              "Since the number of cases where GGE is applied will be small, there might not be an effect at all, but it is hard to say at the moment.",
              "Maybe future research will provide the means of calculating the effects of modified genes on a population level sufficiently.",
              "As long as this is not the case, the wish of few individuals to have a genetically related child does not outweigh the risks for a whole population.",

              "Particular morality refers to norms that bind groups because of their culture, religion, profession and include responsibilities, ideals, professional standards, and so on.",
              "A pertinent example of particular morality is the physician's \u201caccepted role\u201d to provide competent and trustworthy service to their patients.",
              "To reduce the vagueness of \u201caccepted role,\u201d physician organizations (local, state, and national) have codified their standards.",

              "A number of deplorable abuses of human subjects in research, medical interventions without informed consent, experimentation in concentration camps in World War II, along with salutary advances in medicine and medical technology and societal changes, led to the rapid evolution of bioethics from one concerned about professional conduct and codes to its present status with an extensive scope that includes research ethics, public health ethics, organizational ethics, and clinical ethics.",

              "Beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice constitute the 4 principles of ethics.",

              "In modern times, Beauchamp and Childress' book on Principles of Biomedical Ethics is a classic for its exposition of these 4 principles [5] and their application, while also discussing alternative approaches.",
              "The principle of beneficence is the obligation of physician to act for the benefit of the patient and supports a number of moral rules to protect and defend the right of others, prevent harm, remove conditions that will cause harm, help persons with disabilities, and rescue persons in danger.",
              "It is worth emphasizing that, in distinction to nonmaleficence, the language here is one of positive requirements.",
              "The principle calls for not just avoiding harm, but also to benefit patients and to promote their welfare.",
              "While physicians' beneficence conforms to moral rules, and is altruistic, it is also true that in many instances it can be considered a payback for the debt to society for education (often subsidized by governments), ranks and privileges, and to the patients themselves (learning and research).",
              "Nonmaleficence is the obligation of a physician not to harm the patient.",
              "This simply stated principle supports several moral rules \u2212 do not kill, do not cause pain or suffering, do not incapacitate, do not cause offense, and do not deprive others of the goods of life.",
              "The practical application of nonmaleficence is for the physician to weigh the benefits against burdens of all interventions and treatments, to eschew those that are inappropriately burdensome, and to choose the best course of action for the patient.",
              "This is particularly important and pertinent in difficult end-of-life care decisions on withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, medically administered nutrition and hydration, and in pain and other symptom control.",

              "This ethical principle was affirmed in a court decision by Justice Cardozo in 1914 with the epigrammatic dictum, \u201cEvery human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body\u201d [10].",
              "Autonomy, as is true for all 4 principles, needs to be weighed against competing moral principles, and in some instances may be overridden;",

              "Health-care institutions and state governments in the US have policies and procedures to assess incompetence.",
              "However, a rigid distinction between incapacity to make health-care decisions (assessed by health professionals) and incompetence (determined by court of law) is not of practical use, as a clinician's determination of a patient's lack of decision-making capacity based on physical or mental disorder has the same practical consequences as a legal determination of incompetence [11].",
              "Detractors of the principle of autonomy question the focus on the individual and propose a broader concept of relational autonomy (shaped by social relationships and complex determinants such as gender, ethnicity and culture) [12].",
              "Even in an advanced western country such as United States, the culture being inhomogeneous, some minority populations hold views different from that of the majority white population in need for full disclosure, and in decisions about life support (preferring a family-centered approach) [13].",

              "In countries with ancient civilizations, rooted beliefs and traditions, the practice of paternalism (this term will be used in this article, as it is well-entrenched in ethics literature, although parentalism is the proper term) by physicians emanates mostly from beneficence.",
              "However, culture (a composite of the customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious or social group) is not static and autonomous, and changes with other trends over passing years.",
              "It is presumptuous to assume that the patterns and roles in physician-patient relationships that have been in place for a half a century and more still hold true.",
              "Therefore, a critical examination of paternalistic medical practice is needed for reasons that include technological and economic progress, improved educational and socioeconomic status of the populace, globalization, and societal movement towards emphasis on the patient as an individual, than as a member of a group.",
              "This needed examination can be accomplished by research that includes well-structured surveys on demographics, patient preferences on informed consent, truth-telling, and role in decision-making.",
              "Respecting the principle of autonomy obliges the physician to disclose medical information and treatment options that are necessary for the patient to exercise self-determination and supports informed consent, truth-telling, and confidentiality.",
              "The requirements of an informed consent for a medical or surgical procedure, or for research, are that the patient or subject (i) must be competent to understand and decide, (ii) receives a full disclosure, (iii) comprehends the disclosure, (iv) acts voluntarily, and (v) consents to the proposed action.",
              "The universal applicability of these requirements, rooted and developed in western culture, has met with some resistance and a suggestion to craft a set of requirements that accommodate the cultural mores of other countries [14].",
              "In response and in vigorous defense of the 5 requirements of informed consent, Angell wrote, \u201cThere must be a core of human rights that we would wish to see honored universally, despite variations in their superficial aspects .",

              "As competence is the first of the requirements for informed consent, one should know how to detect incompetence.",
              "Standards (used singly or in combination) that are generally accepted for determining incompetence are based on the patient's inability to state a preference or choice, inability to understand one's situation and its consequences, and inability to reason through a consequential life decision [16].",

              "in 1979, however, 98% of surveyed physicians favored it [20].",
              "This marked shift is attributable to many factors that include \u2212 with no order of importance implied \u2212 educational and socioeconomic progress, increased accountability to society, and awareness of previous clinical and research transgressions by the profession.",
              "Importantly, surveys in the US show that patients with cancer and other diseases wish to have been fully informed of their diagnoses and prognoses.",
              "Providing full information, with tact and sensitivity, to patients who want to know should be the standard.",
              "The sad consequences of not telling the truth regarding a cancer include depriving the patient of an opportunity for completion of important life-tasks: giving advice to, and taking leave of loved ones, putting financial affairs in order, including division of assets, reconciling with estranged family members and friends, attaining spiritual order by reflection, prayer, rituals, and religious sacraments [21, 22].",
              "In contrast to the US, full disclosure to the patient is highly variable in other countries [23].",
              "A continuing pattern in non-western societies is for the physician to disclose the information to the family and not to the patient.",
              "The likely reasons for resistance of physicians to convey bad news are concern that it may cause anxiety and loss of hope, some uncertainty on the outcome, or belief that the patient would not be able to understand the information or may not want to know.",
              "However, this does not have to be a binary choice, as careful understanding of the principle of autonomy reveals that autonomous choice is a right of a patient, and the patient, in exercising this right, may authorize a family member or members to make decisions for him/her.",
              "Physicians are obligated not to disclose confidential information given by a patient to another party without the patient's authorization.",
              "An obvious exception (with implied patient authorization) is the sharing necessary of medical information for the care of the patient from the primary physician to consultants and other health-care teams. In the present-day modern hospitals with multiple points of tests and consultants, and the use of electronic medical records, there has been an erosion of confidentiality.",
              "However, individual physicians must exercise discipline in not discussing patient specifics with their family members or in social gatherings [24] and social media.",

              "17 This class of proteins is now referred to as zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), and several similar proteins have been discovered in the proteomes of a number of different organisms. Because each zinc finger recognizes three base pairs, 18 , 19 , 20 a peptide can be created to recognize a target gene by joining the appropriate zinc fingers in a linear fashion.",
              "A 1994 paper describes a ZFP that was engineered to recognize and suppress an oncogene, as well as a ZFP that acted (in a different cell system) as a promoter of another gene by recognizing its activation domain.",
              "21 The same paper suggests that ZFPs can be bound to effector proteins as a means of controlling gene expression.",
              "Building on this idea, researchers fused a ZFP to the nonspecific cleavage domain of the Fok1 restriction enzyme.",
              "22 The resulting heterodimer, known as a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), can recognize a specific DNA sequence and produce a targeted DSB.",
              "As previously mentioned, these DSB can either be repaired via NHEJ, resulting in small indels, or HDR, which can be harnessed to insert an alternate or repaired gene.",
              "Fok1 must dimerize, so ZFNs must be created in pairs (one targeting the 3\u2019 strand and the other targeting the 5\u2019 strand) which improves target specificity\u2014though efficiency remains relatively low (G\u2010rich sequences are especially difficult to target).",
              "Ex vivo and in vivo delivery of ZFNs is relatively easy given their small size and the small size of the ZFN cassettes (which allows for the use of a variety of vectors).",
              "However, while ZFNs were certainly novel at the time they were developed, they are incredibly difficult and expensive to engineer, making them less practical in general than newer technologies.",
              "In 2009, two different laboratories described a newly identified DNA\u2010binding motif: the transcription activator\u2010like effector (TALE), a protein secreted by the plant pathogen Xanthomonas.",
              "23 , 24 Each TALE includes a DNA\u2010binding region composed of tandem repeats with repeat\u2010variable diresidues (RVDs) at positions 12 and 13;",

              "Like ZFPs, synthetic TALEs can be designed to affect gene regulation, 25 combined with effector proteins, or fused to endonucleases 26 , 27 , 28 to create TALE nucleases (TALENs);",
              "as with ZFNs, because Fok1 is the endonuclease used, TALENs must be created in pairs.",
              "TALE nucleases are much larger than ZFNs, and so can be more difficult to deliver efficiently (especially in vivo).",
              "However, for myriad reasons (including the nature of their relative interactions with the DNA and the fact that each RVD recognizes a single base), TALE\u2010based chimeras (especially TALENs) can be built with higher specificity and greater targeting capacity than ZFP\u2010based chimeras.",
              "In addition, TALENs can be produced significantly more cheaply, easily, and with greater efficiency than ZFNs.",

              "After the CRISPR genes are transcribed, endoribonucleases cleave the resulting CRISPR RNA (pre\u2010crRNA), resulting in shorter RNA units composed of a single spacer sequence and the palindromic repeat (crRNA);",
              "depending on the organism, a trans\u2010activating crRNA (tracrRNA) may also be transcribed.",

              "And prime editing addresses genetic disorders caused by multibase variances (such as sickle\u2010cell and Tay\u2010Sachs);",
              "in this case, the impaired Cas9 is fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase.",
              "46 ZFNs and TALENs do maintain some advantages: CRISPR requires a PAM sequence, and sgRNA spacer sequences are usually only about 20 base pairs, meaning an inherently reduced targeting capacity (though researchers have recently begun exploring the effects of increased sgRNA length on cleavage efficiency and target specificity 47 ).",
              "CRISPR vectors are also necessary larger, making delivery more difficult.",
              "Overall, however, CRISPR is generally the preferred method of genetic and epigenetic manipulation, especially as improvements are made to the technology.",
              "CRISPR\u2019s main advantage over its predecessors lies in the fact that rather than a complex protein as the DNA recognition molecule, the CRISPR system relies on a guide RNA.",
              "CRISPR kits are thus significantly cheaper, easier, and more efficiently produced than either ZFNs or TALENs.",

              "49 Researchers then began to explore various methods of extracting a single embryonic cell for PGT: a blastomere biopsy (BB) removed during cleavage stage, 50 trophectoderm biopsy (TB), 51 and polar body biopsy.",
              "52 Meanwhile, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed in 1985 and quickly recognized as a potential tool for PGT when it was used to amplify the portion of the \u03b2\u2010globin locus that includes the DdeI site (absence of which is diagnostic for sickle\u2010cell anemia).",

              "There are divergent views regarding the use of these technologies.",
              "For example, the disability rights movement argues that the use of technologies such as prenatal testing (PNT) and PGD discriminates against people living with a disability (Scully, 2008;",
              "Asch and Barlevy, 2012).",
              "The key arguments presented supporting this view are: (i) the limited value of a genetic trait in respect to the life of an embryo (Parens and Asch, 2000) and (ii) the \u2018expressivist\u2019 argument (Buchanan, 1996;",
              "Shakespeare, 2006).",
              "The first argument is based on the critique that a disabling trait is viewed as being more significant than the life of an embryo/foetus.",
              "This argument was initially used in the context of prenatal testing and selective termination, and has also been applied in the context of new technologies like PGD (Parens and Asch, 2000).",
              "The second, the \u2018expressivist\u2019 argument, argues that the use of these technologies expresses negative or discriminatory views on the disabling conditions they are targeting and subsequently on the people living with these conditions (Asch and Wasserman, 2015).",
              "The expressivist argument, however, has been challenged by stressing the importance of differentiating between the disability itself and the people living with disability (Savulescu, 2001).",
              "The technology\u2019s use is aimed at reducing the incidence of disability, and it does not have a position of value on the people that have a specific condition.",
              "When applying the same arguments to the use of HGE in comparison with other forms of preventing heritable genetic diseases, some important considerations can be made.",
              "Regarding the first argument, in contrast to selective reproduction technologies, HGE may allow the removal of the disabled trait with the aim of ensuring survival of the affected embryo.",
              "However, most likely, PGD would be used before and after the editing of the embryos to help the identification of the ones requiring intervention and verifying the efficiency of the genetic intervention (de Miguel Beriain, 2018;",
              "Ranisch, 2020).",

              "g., Tay-Sachs and Huntington\u2019s disease).",
              "It has been argued that the choice to live without a specific genotype neither implies discriminating people living with a respective condition nor considering the life of people living with the disease not worth living or less valuable (Savulescu, 2001).",
              "In other words, the expressivist argument is not a valid or a sufficiently strong ethical argument for prospective parents not to have the option to have a future child without a genetic disease.",
              "It is worth noting that the debate on the use of reproduction technologies for the prevention of genetic diseases is not at all new, and that modern HGE techniques only serve to highlight ethical concerns that have been expressed for a long time.",
              "In the case of preventing genetic diseases, the application of both arguments to HGE intervention could be considered not to provide sufficiently strong ethical arguments to limit the use of the technology in the future.",
              "However, it is worth exploring whether scientific innovations like HGE are either ameliorating or reinvigorating ethical concerns expressed so far, for example in creating a future that respects or devalues disability as a part of the human condition.",
              "Perhaps even more importantly, given their potential spectrum of possible intervention and efficacy, it is important to reflect on whether the broad use of HGE could have an impact on concepts of disability and \u2018normality\u2019 as a whole distorting an already unclear ethical line between clinical and non-clinical interventions.",
              "Moreover, research work exploring the relationship between disability and identity indicated that personhood with disability can be an important component to people\u2019s identity and interaction with the world.",
              "In the case of heritable human genome editing, it is not yet known how this technology will impact the notions of identity and personhood in people who had their germline genome modified (Boardman and Hale, 2018).",

              "Beside the limits of applicability, another common ethical concern associated with the use of genome editing technologies, as with many new technologies, is the question of accessibility (Baumann, 2016).",
              "Due to the large investments that will need to be made for continuing development of the technology, there is a (perceived) risk of it becoming an expensive technology that only a few wealthy individuals in any population (and/or only citizens in comparatively rich countries) can access.",

              "This may, consequently, contribute to further increases in existing disparities, since individuals or countries with the means of accessing better health treatments may have economic advantages (Bosley et al.",

              "This could enhance inequality at different levels, depending on the limits of applicability of the technology.",
              "Taken to its extreme, the use of the technology could allow germline editing to create and distinguish classes of individuals that could be defined by the quality of their manipulated genome.",

              "Franc\u0327oise Baylis recently echoed such concerns regarding future HGE interventions, namely that \u201cunequal access to genome-editing technologies will both accentuate the vagaries of the natural lottery and introduce an unjust genetic divide that mirrors the current unjust economic and social divide between rich and poor individuals\u201d (Baylis, 2019, p.",

              "An important conclusion of this study is that, along with the technological development of genome germline editing techniques, a shift in the focus of analyses on its applicability has been observed.",

              "Human genomic engineering Genomic editing has become a technological phenomenon that arrived at the forefront of future medical treatment, even in utero.",
              "Work in the area of genomic editing began in 1970 with Paul Berg, who developed technology on the use of recombinant DNA in the alteration of other living organisms [4].",
              "These advancements allowed scientists to begin using these technologies to alter an organism's DNA in order to create certain products, in the case of bacteria, or enzymes, in the case of plants or yeast [4].",
              "Initially, such editing was limited to specific organisms, such as mice or yeast, but as the technology progressed, it began to allow for use of the technology on humans, changing the course of treatment in the medical field [4].",
              "The beginning of human genomic editing lay with two gene-editing techniques that relied on the use of restriction enzymes in editing genomes: zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) [5].",
              "ZFNs have a zinc finger DNA binding domain that is used to bind a specific target DNA sequence as well as a restriction endonuclease domain used to cleave the DNA at the target site.",

              "When future revenues for new drugs or therapies are projected to come from such a small number of patients, the final price of the therapy is high because a company expects a healthy return on investment.",
