    "query": "What is the most innovative approach to addressing food insecurity in developing countries, and how can this approach be scaled up to ensure that everyone has access to healthy and nutritious food?",
    "response": "That's a very important and complex question. There is no single answer to it, but rather a range of possible approaches that can address different aspects of food insecurity in different contexts. According to the article by Boraty\u0144ska and Huseynov[^1^], an innovative approach to food security policy involves both direct and indirect measures that ensure food availability, accessibility, utilization and stability. Some examples of direct measures are structural changes in relative prices and targeted food subsidies, while some examples of indirect measures are improving agricultural infrastructure, the general economic environment, and providing farmers with new farm technologies to increase food production[^1^].\n\nOne of the key challenges for scaling up these approaches is the lack of adequate funding and investment in food system innovation. According to the World Economic Forum and the FAO[^2^], there is a $15.2 billion funding gap for food system innovation that could support ending hunger, keeping emissions within 2\u00b0C and reducing water use by 10%. To close this gap, they recommend establishing a Global Coalition for Digital Food Systems Innovation, a network of Food Innovation Hubs as well as helping farmers invest in sustainable food practices through the 100 Million Farmers platform[^2^].\n\nAnother challenge is the need for inclusive and participatory innovation that involves all stakeholders in the food system, especially those who are most vulnerable and marginalized. This requires fostering a culture of collaboration, co-creation and learning among different actors, such as governments, civil society, private sector, academia and local communities. It also requires ensuring that innovation is context-specific, culturally appropriate and responsive to the needs and preferences of the end-users[^2^].\n\nI hope this gives you some insights into the topic of food security innovation.

              "Governments may find that repurposing some of their support to food and agriculture can be a means to: i) improve agrifood systems efficiency, with fairness and inclusiveness for all agrifood systems actors that want to benefit from such reconfigured policies (equity);",

              "To take advantage of these possibilities, though, a systems approach will be needed.",
              "In other words, other policies and incentives, some of which may pertain to other systems, will have to coherently complement repurposing support efforts in food and agriculture.",
              "Altogether, the policy mix will succeed depending on country context where food insecurity and malnutrition can be the result of several drivers (i.",

              "g. income status, degree of inequality, natural resource endowments, net trade position, and so forth) and political economy considerations and feasibility.",
              "Recent studies show that reallocating public support to food and agriculture differently can lead to improved outcomes, but with potential trade-offs in several important domains for sustainable development that need to be carefully understood.",
              "222 Due to the issues at stake, most of these studies have relied on model-based simulations and because most public support is given to farmers, they focus mostly on agricultural support rather than food and agricultural support.",
              "Repurposing policy support implies an understanding of what would happen if, for example, this support were allocated differently, which would trigger direct but also indirect economy-wide effects.",
              "For example, a reallocation of public expenditure into investments that boost productivity in agriculture sectors will have effects on these sectorsa\u0302\u0080\u0099 production directly.",
              "Yet, it will also have indirect impacts through the productive linkages between these sectors and other sectors of the economy, not least the food industry.",
              "Some agriculture sectors also trade internationally.",
              "Farmers in sectors promoted by such investments will also increase their demand for agricultural inputs as well as their final demand for food since they are also consumers.",
              "These interlinkages justify analysing repurposing food and agricultural support options using simulations from computable general equilibrium (CGE) models.",
              "223 Most existing studies that rely on such models have also focused on reforming or repurposing agricultural support to achieve better climate-related and environmental outcomes.",
              "In these studies, global model-based simulations not only point to the link between agricultural support and GHG emissions, but also find that repurposing such support can lead to reductions in GHG emissions.",
              "However, these global model-based analyses also highlight important trade-offs;",
              "for example, in terms of agriculture production, farm income and economic efficiency.",
              "Although these studies point to several important insights on the affordability of healthy diets,4,224,225,226 this issue has not been at the core of their analyses.",
              "Global model-based analyses warn that removing all agricultural support alone is not an option.",
              "1,227 Such a drastic scenario could lead to some reductions in GHG emissions from agriculture, and efficiency and net-global economic gains, but it would come at a high socioeconomic and human cost to society.",
              "Trade-offs may include significant reductions in crop production, livestock farming production and farm employment.",
              "One of the studies227 analysed the ensuing impact of globally removing support on consumption, diet-related mortality and overweight and obesity by 2030.",
              "The changes in consumption followed the changes in production but were also mediated by changes in trade and commodity prices.",
              "The per capita availability of fruits, vegetables and other horticultural products for consumption decreased in all regions, as did total energy intake.",
              "Associated with these changes was a projected net increase in diet-related mortality, most of which was associated with the reductions in availability of fruits and vegetables for consumption but was slightly compensated for by reductions in overweight and obesity.",
              "Further, the same study points to the resulting increases in mortality which would negatively affect the labour supply and economic welfare.",
              "Another key finding from recent studies is that changing the composition of agricultural support with repurposing can ensure beneficial outcomes while minimizing trade-offs.",
              "For example, one study examines4 the model-based scenario where all countries concertedly repurpose current coupled subsidies into conditional payments to farmers who are achieving higher productivity and adopting lower emission-intensity technologies, while supplementing this with additional government support for R&D in such technologies and infrastructure improvements.",
              "Not only would such a scenario significantly help reduce GHG emissions from both agricultural production and land-use change, but it would also help increase yields globally, contribute to reducing food prices, improve farm incomes in developing countries, reduce poverty and hunger, and incidentally, reduce the cost of a healthy diet for poor people.",
              "Another study,227 using a similar modelling framework, found that on a global scale, several reform options could lead to reductions in GHGs and improvements in population health without reductions in economic welfare.",
              "Those reform options include a repurposing of up to half of those agricultural subsidies that support the production of foods with beneficial health and environmental characteristics, including fruits, vegetables and other horticultural products.",
              "These findings show that smart repurposing of current agricultural support has the potential to contribute to the environmental sustainability of agriculture, while also contributing (moderately) to poverty reduction, food security and better nutrition.",
              "The key to these outcomes is ensuring that the reorientation of support leads to significant efficiency improvements a\u0302\u0080\u0093 both in terms of higher yields and lower emission intensities.",
              "It is also clear that reorienting agricultural incentives in this way will not address all agrifood system challenges in full.",
              "Recent studies that also rely on modelling find that repurposing domestic agricultural subsidies a\u0302\u0080\u0093 particularly those that are coupled to production as defined in Chapter 3 a\u0302\u0080\u0093 to pursue better nutrition, health and environmental outcomes, can be beneficial to transitions towards healthy diets that include sustainability considerations.",
              "227,228 For example, positive gains could be made in terms of human health through increased consumption of nutritious foods, including fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds and pulses.",
              "228 Repurposing half or all subsidies to nutritious foods is found to lead to hundreds of thousands of fewer diet-related deaths and reductions in GHG emissions.",
              "Modelling also shows that the resulting shifts in resource demand for water, land, nitrogen and phosphorus are generally modest, and changes in management practices may arguably be more effective in moderating water and land use (e.",
              "g. subsidy reforms include incentives for adopting sustainable management practices, in addition to encouraging changes in the mix of production).",
              "These studies focus on subsidies, though, thus leaving out other instruments of policy support.",
              "While the global model-based analyses described above have provided important policy insights for repurposing support efforts, they fall short in helping us more thoroughly understand what repurposing scenarios mean if they were to include lowering the cost of nutritious foods and increasing the affordability of healthy diets for all as a key policy objective.",
              "Bridging these knowledge gaps is critical to inform decision-making in repurposing support to ensure it contributes to ending hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition with synergies for other development goals.",
              "It is also important for governments to understand ways in which in times of economic sluggishness, as is the case nowadays, public resources can be spent wisely with the highest cost-effectiveness possible to improve peoplea\u0302\u0080\u0099s lives while respecting the planet.",
              "The remainder of this section presents new analysis of model-based scenarios of repurposed food and agricultural policy support specially developed for this report, mostly at the global level, but adding country examples.",
              "It tackles a number of key questions: What could be the impacts of allocating current public support to food and agriculture differently on both food production and consumption patterns, in ways that affect the cost of nutritious foods (relative to other foods and peoplea\u0302\u0080\u0099s incomes) and thus change peoplea\u0302\u0080\u0099s affordability of healthy diets?",
              "Are results from repurposing different for specific groups of countries?",
              "What trade-offs could arise between multiple sustainable development objectives and mixes of policies, and what alternative policy mixes exist to avoid them?",
              "Repurposing may not be feasible for some countries, especially for LICs but also for some LMICs that are barely spending on food and agriculture while still undergoing agricultural transformation.",
              "For these countries, the question then becomes: a\u0302\u0080\u009chow fara\u0302\u0080\u009d could repurposing take them?",
              "While there may be little potential for repurposing (or reallocating) resources in these countries, there is potential to reform policies and to use these resources more efficiently and effectively.",
              "How can these countries ensure that agricultural transformation and increasing access to healthy diets are synergic through policy support?",
              "Some of the studies discussed above used the Modelling International Relations under Applied General Equilibrium (MIRAGRODEP) model to gauge the potential impacts of eliminating and reallocating agricultural support differently.",
              "This is a global, recursive-dynamic CGE model with multiregions and multisectors, which links the agricultural sector to the broader economy and captures economy-wide effects from policy changes.",
              "It was initially developed to analyse the impacts of agricultural policies on GHG emissions229 and was expanded to analyse impacts on nature, climate, food availability for consumption and nutrition.",
              "1,4,226,227 The MIRAGRODEP model has been further expanded for this report to analyse potential impacts of repurposing food and agricultural policies to specifically reduce the cost and increase the affordability of a healthy diet.",
              "It also relies on the updated agricultural producer support data presented in Chapter 3.",
              "As in the case of any economic model, the results of simulating policy changes using MIRAGRODEP are highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and the data used.",
              "For this reason, the analysis of scenarios presented in this section focuses on the direction and the relative magnitude of estimated effects, rather than on the actual magnitude.",
              "The results are best interpreted as indicative of the likely effects.",
              "A more detailed description of how this model has been expanded for this report and on the data is found in the background paper of The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2022,230 and more technical details (including the modela\u0302\u0080\u0099s mathematical statement) are found in Glauber and Laborde (forthcoming).",
              "230 The analysis takes as a reference a baseline scenario from 2017 to 2030, which is aligned with the United Nationsa\u0302\u0080\u0099 demographic projections231 and updated economic growth estimates from the IMF.",
              "232 Summary statistics for baseline projections are presented in Glauber and Laborde (forthcoming).",
              "230 In essence, this is a business-as-usual scenario because there are no shifts in the way governments from all over the world are supporting food and agriculture.",
              "Policy instruments of the baseline are changed to generate five additional scenarios (see Table 7).",
              "Price incentives through border measures and market price controls on the one hand, and fiscal subsidies to producers on the other, are respectively eliminated in the second and third of these scenarios.",
              "In the fourth to the sixth, policy support is reallocated in different ways with the purpose of reducing the cost and increasing the affordability of a healthy diet.",
              "All five policy scenarios assume that all countries of the world simultaneously implement the same policy change a\u0302\u0080\u0093 even if all countries do not have the same development levels, economic structures, policy systems and priorities, and, importantly, do not have the same level and structure of policy support.",
              "Following definitions in Glauber and Laborde (forthcoming),230 key food security, nutrition, equity and climate variables for which results are presented include: Results for the five policy scenarios are reported as percentage point change from the baseline scenario in 2030 for the affordability of a healthy diet, the income gap in the affordability of a healthy diet, the PoU and the population in extreme poverty.",
              "The results are reported as percentage change from the baseline scenario in 2030 for farm income, agricultural production and total GHG emissions from agriculture including land-use changes.",
              "Results from the second and third scenarios whereby, respectively, border support and market price control or fiscal subsidies to producers are removed from the baseline scenario help reinforce the case that eliminating such support altogether would not be a feasible option.",
              "When all border support and market price control measures affecting agricultural products a\u0302\u0080\u0093 both positively and negatively a\u0302\u0080\u0093 are removed globally, agricultural imports increase, and this lowers prices for consumers and producers in food-importing countries, although food prices go up for food exporting countries whose products are in higher demand.",
              "In turn, an overall reduction in agricultural prices help reduce undernourishment, increase the affordability of a healthy diet and shrink the income gap towards affording a healthy diet, particularly in LMICs (Table A6.",
              "2 in Annex 6).",
              "Total GHG emissions from agriculture fall as well, but these benefits are not free of trade-offs.",
              "Global extreme poverty essentially does not change a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and actually increases in LMICs.",
              "There is a clear reduction in global agricultural production in all but HICs, and farm income falls in MICs and LICs where border support is more typically provided than fiscal subsidies (Table A6.",
              "2 in Annex 6).",
              "The reduction in total GHG emissions in agriculture results from less agricultural production in MICs and LICs.",
              "Trade-offs are even more apparent when all fiscal subsidies given to producers individually a\u0302\u0080\u0093 mostly in HICs and UMICs a\u0302\u0080\u0093 are removed, keeping all other support including border measures and market price controls in place (Table A6.",
              "3 in Annex 6).",
              "Effects are particularly adverse in terms of farm income and agricultural production particularly in HICs, although global food security and nutrition may also deteriorate.",
              "The drop in global agricultural production pushes agricultural prices up, which in the context of LICs is somewhat favourable to agricultural production, farm income and poverty reduction.",
              "Even so, poverty increases globally, and both the decline in farm income in some LMICs in Asia and the aforementioned increased prices push up the PoU and the cost of nutritious foods, thus leaving a healthy diet less affordable, particularly in LMICs.",
              "There is a reduction in GHG emissions from agriculture given the decrease in global agricultural production, but the trade-offs in food security, nutrition and equity reinforce the case that eliminating fiscal subsidies to producers is not a feasible option.",
              "On the basis of these results, policymakers may see in repurposing support to food and agriculture a better option than eliminating such support.",
              "Policymakers will need to consider the potential options to repurpose policy support to food and agriculture for improving affordability of healthy diets.",
              "This includes the consideration of different scenarios that can inform decisions for policy reforms. These scenarios simulate the reallocation of current budgets supporting agricultural producers using different policy instruments.",
              "This is done for all countries from all geographical regions, in order to reduce the cost and increase the affordability of a healthy diet (see Table 7).",
              "This reallocation is implemented linearly between 2023 and 2028, and impacts are examined for 2030, a year by which sufficient time will have elapsed for policy changes to have been implemented and for markets and investments to have adjusted.",
              "The policy instruments under consideration are price incentives through border measures and market price controls, fiscal subsidies given to producers individually, and fiscal subsidies to consumers (as defined in Section 3.",
              "1).",
              "Because the policy objective is to reduce the cost and increase the affordability of a healthy diet a\u0302\u0080\u0093 sustainably and inclusively, the repurposing scenarios are such that food products whose current consumption levels are low relative to recommended dietary levels are subsidized at a higher rate than all other food products.",
              "Food products are classified in terms of such suboptimal intake, and the targeted level of support is defined based on how this deficiency earmarks them as a\u0302\u0080\u009chigh-prioritya\u0302\u0080\u009d, a\u0302\u0080\u009cmedium-prioritya\u0302\u0080\u009d or a\u0302\u0080\u009clow-prioritya\u0302\u0080\u009d foods.",

              "At the same time, there are no unique and objective criteria to define such classification.",
              "Moreover, regional specificities, not only in terms of production practices, but also in relation to dietary habits and cultural preferences, can also impact the classification.",
              "In the three repurposing scenarios analysed in this section, agricultural products are classified based on the level of current per capita consumption (adjusting for food loss) in each country/region, relative to the recommended levels for that country/region, as defined by the FBDGs used for the computation of the cost of a healthy diet (see Section 2.",

              "The trade-off between increasing the affordability of healthy diets and GHG emissions in agriculture (and even economic recovery) is seen globally when fiscal subsidies are repurposed but continue to be allocated to producers within agriculture, particularly in LICs and MICs.",
              "On the other hand, there are far fewer trade-offs when repurposing support only makes its way through border measures and market price controls.",
              "Of course, it is important to understand the limitations of model-based scenarios.",
              "The scenarios discussed up until now do not consider the fact that some production technologies generate more or less GHG emissions (or environmental damage) than others.",
              "For example, changes in the pattern of policy support in the scenarios, with more or fewer fertilizers for instance, could change a\u0302\u0080\u0093 at the margins a\u0302\u0080\u0093 the emission intensity of some products.",
              "But the scenarios do not explicitly consider a shift towards technologies that are relatively lower in emission intensity (e.",
              "g. new feed technologies for cattle, improved bio-control approaches for pest managements, new crop rotation practices for improving soil health and reduce fertilizer uses, and so forth).",
              "In practice, repurposing support need not be at the cost of higher GHG emissions if, at the same time, low-emission intensity technologies are adopted to produce the nutritious foods, and if current overproduction and overconsumption of foods, including meat and dairy products, in HICs and UMICs are reduced in line with healthy eating guidelines.",
              "Another issue is the broad nature of the food categories for the high-priority foods used in the scenarios because, for example, the extent to which increased consumption of fats and oils contributes to healthy diets is not clear in all contexts, at least not without more specific data on the types of fats and oils.",
              "The results of the scenarios also suggest that providing fiscal subsidies to consumers tends to generate more diversified healthy food consumption patterns with GHG emission reduction, compared with providing fiscal subsidies to producers, even if both policies target the same nutritious foods.",
              "This is expected because reducing the cost and increasing the affordability of healthy diets is a consumer-side objective, rather than a producer-side objective.",
              "But then, again, the policy of subsidizing consumers of a\u0302\u0080\u009chigh-prioritya\u0302\u0080\u009d foods for healthy diets does not come free of trade-offs in farm income, agricultural production and even the cost of a healthy diet in the case of LICs, which policymakers may like to avoid in practice.",
              "In the case of LICs, for example, the cost of healthy and current diets is found to increase marginally when fiscal subsidies are shifted from producers to consumers for two reasons: i) increased import demand for LICsa\u0302\u0080\u0099 food in the rest of the world raises food prices, and ii) there are limited fiscal subsidies in LICs to reallocate for meaningfully incentivizing the demand for nutritious foods.",
              "This is an important trade-off to consider, particularly in the context of Africa, where healthy diets are found to become more affordable generally when consumersa\u0302\u0080\u0099 incomes increase, because reducing the cost of healthy diets presents more challenges in these countries.",
              "However, the poorer households with low- or no-income generation capacity may not be in a position to benefit under this type of scenario.",
              "To avoid trade-offs, policymakers may not try to reduce the cost and increase the affordability of healthy diets by shifting fiscal subsidies from producers (agriculture) to consumers.",
              "They may consider phasing out fiscal subsidies to producers that are tied to the production of a specific commodity and are proven distorting, environmentally harmful and not promoting the production of nutritious foods.",
              "In this case, the resources may be redirected to fiscal subsidies to producers that are decoupled from production but whose design is nutrition-sensitive, promotes the adoption of low-emission intensity technologies and includes other environmental conditionalities.",
              "At the same time, policymakers may want to take advantage of the evidence emerging from this report, which indicates that a fiscal subsidy to commodities whose consumption needs to increase to follow dietary guidelines is a very efficient policy.",
              "Unfortunately, subsidies to consumers form the tiniest share of all the support being provided to food and agriculture in the world (see Figure 18 in Chapter 3).",
              "To make the most of such fiscal subsidies, it is important to step up consumer support.",
              "To take advantage of the opportunities that repurposing support may offer in practice, countries will have to get together at the multilateral table;",
              "unilateral action may be useful but insufficient in some cases, and in others it could have damaging consequences.",
              "The repurposing of border measures and market price controls and fiscal subsidies will have to consider countriesa\u0302\u0080\u0099 commitments and flexibilities under current WTO rules, as well as issues in the ongoing negotiations (Box 15).",
              "Box 8 in Chapter 3 outlined how price incentives and fiscal support measures are disciplined by the WTO rules.",
              "In this context, it is important to consider that repurposing agricultural subsidies would have implications for countriesa\u0302\u0080\u0099 commitments as WTO members.",
              "For example, if a country raises fiscal subsidies to producers on nutritious foods with the objective of lowering their final cost to consumers, these would still be considered trade-distorting in the context of the WTO AoA, as product-specific subsidies are included in the Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS), which is subject to limits.",
              "All WTO members have the right to provide subsidies to specific products a\u0302\u0080\u0093 regardless of their nutritional value a\u0302\u0080\u0093 if their AMS ceiling (which differs depending on country-specific WTO commitments) is not exceeded.",
              "* It would therefore be important to consider these limits if a country opts for shifting subsidies from one product to another.",
              "If, on the other hand, countries choose to reduce trade-distorting subsidies, they have the option of providing direct income support to farmers instead.",
              "Income support that is decoupled from production levels can be used without any limits as part of a\u0302\u0080\u009cGreen Boxa\u0302\u0080\u009d measures (Box 8).",
              "Likewise, countries could increase GSS for which no limits are imposed under the WTO rules, provided that the criteria set in the AoA are met.",
              "In essence, countries could reduce or eliminate product-specific subsidies for products with lower nutritional value or which do not contribute to healthy diets and introduce alternative measures that include the expansion of public funding to infrastructure services, research programmes for nutritious foods, and agricultural extension services without jeopardizing compliance with the WTO rules.",
              "This means that repurposing does not need to imply a reduction in the overall level of food and agricultural support, but rather a shifting to less trade-distorting measures.",
              "Countries could also opt for a reduction of border measures (including high tariffs and in-quota tariffs) on nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables, while not changing or even increasing trade protection for products high in fats, sugars or salt.",
              "Under WTO rules, countries are allowed to do so up to a certain limit (the bound level of tariffs).",
              "** Repurposing agricultural subsidies, if undertaken by many countries, could even open a new chapter for agricultural trade negotiations at the WTO.",
              "Countries could find new ground for discussion on how to discipline trade-distorting domestic support.",
              "One option would be increasing the flexibility for providing product-specific subsidies to producers of nutritious foods.",
              "Likewise, in the context of the negotiations on market access that includes tariffs, countries could consider reducing the bound level of tariffs on fruits, vegetables, legumes and other products important to healthy diets, fostering trade in such products.",
              "The issue of GSS to improve the affordability of healthy diets is a special case.",
              "It is mostly relevant for countries where the current level of this type of support is low, agricultural transformation is still underway, and existing productivity gaps in agriculture remain large, which is generally the case of LICs and LMICs.",
              "In the context of healthy diets, GSS can be a critical component of public support to address issues such as, for example, Post-Harvest handling and Post-Harvest Loss (PHL), which can particularly affect perishable nutritious foods.",
              "When in line with the provisions of the relevant WTO agreements, this type of public expenditure can be provided without limits (Box 15).",
              "Stepping up GSS for reducing the cost of nutritious foods so healthy diets become more affordable should not slow down inclusive agricultural transformation in LICs and LMICs.",
              "Moreover, by definition, GSS will collectively support agriculture, without excluding small farmers, women and youth.",
              "However, the way in which GSS expenditures are repurposed or scaled up in practice needs to take into account that productivity gaps are larger for some of these agrifood systems actors, particularly women who generally exhibit limited access to and control of productive resources and livelihood assets such as land and credit, inadequate agricultural extension and other services and rural infrastructure.",
              "236 A key challenge for policymakers in LICs, and perhaps also some LMICs, will not only be to reach compromises in repurposing food and agricultural support to achieve several inclusive agricultural transformation objectives that are well aligned with reducing the cost of nutritious foods.",
              "Considering their low budgets, governments of these countries will also have to mobilize significant financing to step up the provision of: i) GSS where it has to be mostly prioritized to effectively bridge productivity gaps in the production of nutritious foods with inclusivity and sustainability;",
              "and ii) fiscal subsidies to consumers to increase affordability.",
              "In this regard, international public investment support (e.",
              "g. from International Financial Organizations [IFIs], regional development banks, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme [GAFSP], and so forth) will be key to ease the transition towards higher GSS, especially in LICs.",

              "ac This process takes into consideration key structural parameters of countries, including their income-expenditure elasticities, commoditiesa\u0302\u0080\u0099 shares of food baskets, food price elasticities, etc.",
              "ad The cost of a healthy diet is measured at the consumer level, where a number of additional costs along the value chain could eventually offset the actual price reduction at the farm gate price.",
              "The effect of shifting the producer support instrument could be more significant on the farm gate price and producer costs than on consumer prices.",
              "This is also the case for the next repurposing scenarios.",
              "ae Further data and disaggregation within food groups are needed.",
              "Specifically in relation to the types of fats and oils, further data would be essential to determine the extent to which changes in consumption of this food group contribute to a healthy diet in all contexts.",

              "ag In this case, production and consumption decisions are affected only through income effects in the sense that their production and consumption decisions are no longer linked to the subsidy itself.",
              "ah While both scenarios of repurposing fiscal subsidies assume the same rate of subsidies across all targeted high-priority foods, the consequences in terms of relative prices at the consumer level varies significantly if the policy instrument is a consumer subsidy versus a producer subsidy.",
              "Indeed, a given subsidy rate at the farm gate level will lead to a higher reduction in consumer prices for fruits and vegetables, compared with the same subsidy rate given to more processed products such as vegetable oils and dairy products;",
              "therefore, consumption of fruits and vegetables will increase more when the increase in the subsidy is given to the producer rather than the consumer.",
              "Also, the relative economic size of the fruits and vegetables sector, compared with that of dairy and vegetable oils, will be larger when measured at farm gate than at retail level.",
              "Therefore, when applying the same rate of support across these products, the fruits and vegetable sector will receive a higher share of support if this is given to the producer rather than the consumer."

              "Below, we explore the potential hunger-reducing impacts of the stimulus checks with a more nuanced analysis to see if there is indeed solid evidence that food adequacy rose as a result of the income support provisions in the two COVID relief bills.",
              "For each survey period from June 2020 to March 2021, Figures 3a and 3b plot trends in food insufficiency rates for three groups of households[5]: 1) Those that experienced a loss of employment income in the household since March 2020 and used EIP funds in the past week to meet spending needs (\u201cIncome Loss, EIP\u201d);",

              "[6] Food insufficiency rates for the last group of households\u2014those that neither experienced a loss in employment income, nor relied on stimulus checks in the past week to meet their spending needs\u2014were relatively stable throughout the study period.",
              "The smaller variation in food security over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic is not surprising, since these households likely experienced less pandemic-linked financial instability.",
              "By contrast, food insufficiency rates for households that had experienced a loss of employment income and relied on stimulus checks in the past week to meet their spending needs were generally increasing from June to December 2020.",

              "Food insufficiency rates for these households reached their lowest points at the end of March 2021 (16 and 18 percent, respectively), which is the first survey period after the ARP stimulus checks were distributed.",
              "From December 2020 to January 2021, food insufficiency rates also fell for households that lost employment income, but did not make use of an EIP to meet their past-week spending needs.",
              "However, these drops in food insufficiency rates were much smaller\u2014roughly a third of the size\u2014than the drops seen among the households that experienced a loss in employment income and did spend out of EIP funds in the past week.",
              "It is important to note that while these improvements in food adequacy may be explained by the use of EIP funds greater than a week prior to the survey, EIP fund usage beyond the past week is not captured in the data.",
              "Establishing causality running from EIP spending to food hardship is difficult but, taken together, the patterns observed in the data after both official stimulus check disbursement dates strongly suggest that income support through the Federal government\u2019s EIP program deserves at least partial credit for improvements in food security seen after January 2021.",
              "The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 also provided supplemental unemployment insurance (UI) benefits ($300 per week) until March 2021, which was further extended by the ARP through September 2021.",

              "Compared with other households, those that relied on UI benefits to meet their past-week spending needs show steeper increases in food insufficiency rates after the $600 Federal UI benefit boost expired in July 31, 2020, showing even sharper drops in January 2021.",

              "The HCO3\u2212 ions that form are either transported to the ocean, where the carbon is sequestered on timescales of more than 105 years, or precipitated as pedogenic carbonates, which are typically stable on timescales of around 104 years28 (Fig.",

              "Considerable unrealized potential exists for extending ERW practices by spreading basalt on grasslands, rangelands and pastures, whose productivity is often limited by soil acidification and depletion of nutrients, including silica.",

              "Further research is required to assess costs of CO2 drawdown, environmental risks (for example, accumulation of potentially toxic metals) and responses of soil organic carbon stocks with ERW.",
              "Options for meeting the demand for silicate rock in a sustainable, publicly acceptable manner must also be assessed, including opportunities for using rock dust by-products of the mining industry to facilitate ERW scalability without additional mining, thereby building a circular economy27.",
              "Increases in crop yield potential will depend on increased total biomass, given that harvest index is now maximized for the major food crops.",
              "Increased photosynthetic efficiency may thus be the only remaining option34,35.",
              "For a long time, it was accepted that evolution and selection would have already optimized the process, with little prospect of improvement.",
              "However, analysis has shown that efficiency in current crop cultivars falls far short of the theoretical maximum35.",
              "Photosynthesis is probably the most studied of all plant processes, and these studies have yielded key insights into how efficiency could be increased34,35.",
              "This has culminated in demonstrated substantial increases in photosynthetic efficiency, crop productivity and sustainability in replicated field trials36,37,38.",

              "One such innovation, designed to future-proof soybean against rising CO2 concentration and temperature, has already been demonstrated under field conditions40.",
              "It should be emphasized how crucial it is to increase plant photosynthesis if climate and food security are to be delivered: with higher photosynthetic capacity and higher consequent biomass production, it will be possible to consider how to optimize allocation within the plant, to allow both high food yield and increased soil carbon storage in roots using the approaches described above.",
              "Realizing increased yield potential in farm fields requires an adequate water supply for the crop.",
              "This suggests two possible problems. First, rising temperature increases the drying power of the atmosphere exponentially, so crops will require substantially more water in the future.",
              "Second, success in increasing production potential would only be realized in higher yield if more water is available.",
              "For example, the US corn\u2013soy belt, the largest single area of global food production, is currently predominantly rainfed, but to meet future food demand it would have to become predominantly irrigated41.",
              "Will it be possible to meet future demand without stressing water resources even further?",
              "Photosynthesis and water use are inextricably linked, because the leaf stomata control the influx of CO2 and the loss of water;",
              "adjusting stomatal function has thus been the focus for much research42.",
              "Recently, upregulation of a single gene has been shown to increase crop water use efficiency43, and similar gains may be achieved by manipulating stomatal numbers and distribution44.",
              "Increasing the rate of opening and closing of stomata when light levels change has been suggested to be a target for increasing water use efficiency and biomass accumulation45, recently borne out experimentally46.",
              "Further efficiencies are offered by agronomic practices that improve soil pore and aggregate structure, which increase the capacity of soil to both store and supply plant-available water.",
              "All of the soil amendments described above support soil structure development, which is intimately linked to plant traits that contribute to photosynthate allocation below ground47.",
              "Fertilizer is the principal source of GHG emissions from cereal farming48, but achieving increased crop yield without increasing nitrogen fertilizer applications is a challenge.",
              "A cereal yield of 10 t ha\u22121 with an average of 10% protein content requires a minimum addition of 160 kgN ha\u22121, and this assumes the crop assimilates all of the applied fertilizer and all of this is translocated to the grain at crop maturation.",
              "For every additional ton of yield, an additional 16 kgN ha\u22121 will be required.",
              "New approaches to supporting plant nitrogen metabolism are urgently needed.",
              "One approach is to develop nitrogen-fixing cereals by introducing plant genetic elements that allow invasion by nitrogen-fixing bacteria49.",
              "However, nitrogen fixation is costly to the plant, accounting for an estimated 50% of potential biomass in legumes.",
              "Losses would be greater where nitrogen comes from free-living nitrogen fixers in the microbiome.",
              "These losses could be offset by simultaneously increasing photosynthetic efficiency using the technologies noted above.",
              "Another novel approach may come from understanding how plants respond to nitrogen availability, which could allow much more efficient nitrogen use23,50.",
              "Improved agronomic practice currently has the most important role in reducing fertilizer applications through precision placement in the field.",
              "Global Positioning System (GPS)-tracked harvesting provides high-spatial-resolution datasets on variation in yield across fields, identifying where fertilizer is needed most in subsequent planting, while unmanned aerial vehicles can routinely track colour to guide top-dressing.",
              "This is increasingly supported by high-throughput high-resolution probing of soil quality, making most farm operations driven increasingly by big data, coupled with better agricultural weather forecasting for timing farm operations.",
              "Robotics coupled with GPS could further revolutionize the situation: enabling an operator to monitor multiple robots planting in more optimal agronomies, weeding, harvesting and monitoring pests and diseases for targeted chemical intervention only where needed51.",
              "By contrast, on the non-mechanized smallholdings that feed much of sub-Saharan Africa, improvements can come from optimal placement of seed and fertilizer, together with multi-cropping, as successfully being promoted by the One-Acre Fund52.",
              "If the food produced per unit land area could be sustainably increased and be resilient to climate change, a reduction in total agricultural land area could be realized.",
              "For example, it is estimated that the Green Revolution saved 18\u201327 million hectares of land from cultivation53.",

              "However, with the projected need for 60% more food by 2050, we must recognize that it will probably be challenging merely to constrain agriculture to the land it is already using, and this raises the questions: (1) what processes are most likely to reduce agricultural land?",
              "and (2) what are the best strategies for using the land made available?",
              "Two types of changes in the agrifood system have been suggested as means to reduce agricultural land use.",
              "First, reducing global meat consumption alone would free up the vast land areas currently used to provide grazing and feed crops for livestock.",

              "The yield gap is the difference between the maximum potential yield, or that achieved by best practices for a crop, versus the yield achieved on average.",
              "It can also be described as the gap between yields achieved in high-income countries and in low-income countries, especially those whose food security is challenged.",
              "For more than 50 years, much national investment and international aid has been focused on this challenge.",
              "Most recently, it has been projected from modelling that closing the yield gap could release 50% of agricultural land globally, but this requires substantial increases in yield across Africa57.",

              "The challenge of closing the yield gap is evident in the fact that African farms, on average, achieved 27% of the maize yield of North American farmers in 1962, declining to just 17% in 2018 (ref.",

              "A study by the Initiative for Smallholder Finance found that financial institutions are providing only a quarter of the $200 billion smallholder farmers around the world need to scale their businesses.",
              "A primary reason for this gap is that our existing financial tools aren\u2019t well-structured for food-system solutions.",
              "Traditional agricultural lenders are set up to finance large-scale monocrop farms, even though small, diversified farms are more resilient, especially in a changing climate.",
              "Many of them use agricultural practices that build healthy soils and increase water retention, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity.",
              "Meanwhile, investors and financial institutions that are more-broadly focused look for a positive correlation between risk and return.",
              "That\u2019s a difficult standard for the agriculture sector to meet, given unpredictable weather patterns, pests, disease, undervalued markets for sustainable food production, subsidies for conventional production, and market fluctuations.",
              "It\u2019s doubly difficult for smaller farmers and food businesses, which, on top of these inherent risks, tend to operate on thin financial margins.",
              "But while these are high-risk, low-return enterprises in financial terms, their work aligns with many foundations\u2019 missions: They strengthen rural economies by providing quality jobs across the food supply chain, allow farmers to retain a bigger share of consumer revenue, and often have a lighter environmental footprint.",
              "We need investors who see the value in these nonfinancial returns to put money behind smaller agriculture businesses.",
              "This is where foundations could have an enormous impact.",
              "Private foundations are arguably in the best position to finance family and smallholder farmers, transformative food entrepreneurs, and food-system organizations, given that the purpose of foundation capital is to further a charitable mission, and most private foundations can invest 95 percent of their assets wherever they choose.",
              "More and more foundations are adopting socially responsible investing strategies for those assets.",
              "Often this means they\u2019re avoiding investments in certain industries, such as fossil fuels and tobacco, which amounts to doing less harm versus doing more good.",

              "As our largest societal and environmental challenges\u2014including feeding the world\u2014loom, we need that commitment to dedicating all assets to solving problems now.",
              "Investing in individuals, cooperatives, and businesses that provide critical services to farmers allows foundations to further activate their endowment capital and support their grantmaking in this area.",
              "Some foundations are incorporating an impact investing framework that uses public and private investment in food systems to generate local wealth, rather than extract it.",
              "They are using MRIs and PRIs to integrate their grant and investment capital, and create new models that move capital to serve smaller enterprises.",
              "The Swift Foundation, for example, aims to create impact across all asset classes, with a focus on smallholder farmer livelihoods, soil health, and access to diverse, healthy food.",
              "Swift supports food enterprises with grants, investment capital, and connections to other organizations and networks.",
              "It also promotes communication and collaboration between its program and investment staff\u2014groups often siloed within foundations.",
              "One organization Swift supports is California FarmLink, a community development financial institution and nonprofit that fortifies early-stage farmers with one-on-one technical assistance, education, connections, and resources.",
              "FarmLink serves farmers and ranchers from undercapitalized communities in central and Northern California\u2014including beginners, people with limited resources, and immigrants\u2014through land-access programs and capital that has more-flexible credit criteria than traditional agricultural lenders use.",
              "For example, FarmLink lends to people who have few or no assets, but who have farming experience and developed markets.",
              "Since making a loan to FarmLink, Swift has provided a multiyear general support grant that gives it added capacity to reach organic, sustainable farmers who otherwise can\u2019t get the financing they need to grow their businesses.",
              "Developing the right structure and completing the due diligence for this type of investment does require some specialized knowledge and resources.",

              "It hired a consultant with expertise in consumer-packaged goods, for example, to help investment staff evaluate a direct investment opportunity in a company sourcing sustainably gathered wild honey from Indigenous communities in India.",
              "For foundations that don\u2019t want to invest heavily in staff resources, at least to start, investments in pooled funds are a good first step.",
              "Since they involve multiple farmers or enterprises, these funds mitigate risk so that co-investors share any portfolio losses.",
              "A few examples of funds focused on food systems include Iroquois Valley Farmland REIT, RSF\u2019s Food System Transformation Fund, and California FarmLink (Swift invests in both Iroquois Valley Farms and the RSF fund;",

              "Iroquois Valley reduces the inherent risk in agriculture by allowing impact investors or foundations to support multiple farms and provide return profiles that prioritize the needs of farmers\u2014though that\u2019s not to say investor returns are insignificant.",
              "RSF\u2019s Food System Transformation Fund is a way for foundations to invest using funds earmarked for program-related investments (PRIs) or mission-related investments.",

              "The FSTF, which currently funds 19 enterprises across the United States, lends to organizations providing regional food infrastructure services (such as processing, aggregation, and distribution) to help small farmers access markets and resources.",
              "In these pooled fund examples, the farmers and enterprises are challenging industrial-scale enterprises, testing new business models, and supporting their regional food system.",
              "While the financial return may seem low to traditionally minded investment teams, the returns to soil health, farmers\u2019 well-being, job creation, and healthful food for communities can be high.",
              "This is why foundation capital is important.",
              "Foundations that want to take on the food system challenge will do well to assess internal barriers that may hinder success.",
              "Identifying the bottlenecks to investing in long-term, high-impact, and low-return investments is a good place to start (see the Surdna Foundation\u2019s report on its journey to impact investing).",
              "The best next step is to create or join a community of practice, where foundations can learn from one another, hold each other accountable, and jointly participate in investments.",
              "Sustainable Agriculture and Food System Funders, for example, is a national network that provides learning and networking opportunities for members.",
              "We need all forms of capital to create a better food system, but foundations are perhaps best positioned to support the ground-level innovation that will eventually lead to widespread change.",
              "To play that role, they must commit to rethinking the relationship between risk and return.",
              "They must align their investments with their grantmaking strategies and engage with foundation colleagues to encourage movement building.",

              "All stakeholders\u2019 expertise is valued, but there is a strong focus on development of new technology and school-level design in much of the participatory design literature (DiSalvo et al.",
              "2017) and students are often considered informants or testers rather than partners with high levels of agency (Martens et al.",
              "2019).",
              "The terms, students as partners, partnership, and co-creation of learning and teaching are often used interchangeably.",
              "I have chosen to use the term co-creation predominantly in this paper for a number of reasons: co-creation does not assume the level of equality sometimes implied by partnership, teaching staff are sometimes resistant to using the term partnership (my experience suggests some colleagues find the radical overtones of the term threatening and they disengage from conversations about partnership), and the term \u2018students as partners\u2019 has been critiqued for only naming one of the partners involved in the partnership (Cook-Sather 2018).",
              "Outside of an \u2018inner partnership circle\u2019 (made up of key authors of partnership articles and editors of partnership journals), I have found that many staff and students prefer to talk of striving for meaningful relationships, which may, due to the nature of higher education structures and assessment processes, fall short of what many consider to be true partnership.",

              "One of the challenges raised by this rich diversity is ensuring clarity about the nature of work being described, researched, and discussed internationally.",
              "For researchers to build upon existing evidence, and to enable deeper discussions and understandings to develop within the field, this clarity is currently much needed.",
              "In response, Bovill et al.",
              "(2016) outlined a typology of four roles that students adopt in co-creation work: representative, consultant, co-researcher, and pedagogical co-designer.",

              "and the co-research and pedagogical co-designer roles, where students may or may not be selected depending on if teachers choose to work with a small group or a whole class of students.",
              "In an alternative categorisation, Buckley (2014) has suggested that student engagement work (which encompasses much partnership and co-creation work) divides into two main areas of focus: the pedagogical and the political, with the former focused on learning and teaching and the latter focused on university governance.",

              "Model A partnership is work that involves only a small selection of students working with staff, and model B partnership is work involving all students within the curriculum.",
              "There are further related frameworks that I have not included here in order to avoid unnecessary complexity.",
              "Bovill and Woolmer (2018: 5) distinguish between co-creation of the curriculum (co-design of a programme or course, usually before the programme or course takes place) and co-creation in the curriculum (co-design of learning and teaching within a course or programme usually during the course or programme).",
              "In this paper, I focus specifically on whole-class co-creation in learning and teaching (co-creation taking place involving all students studying a course as the course unfolds).",
              "In the next section, I will explain this concept further and provide examples.",
              "Whole-class co-creation in learning and teaching involves inviting a whole group of students who are studying together in any teaching setting face-to-face or online, to actively collaborate and negotiate with the teacher and each other, elements of the learning process.",
              "This might include negotiation of the content or subject matter, the purpose of their work, the teaching approach, the many ways in which they can work and learn together, or their preferred approach to evaluation.",
              "When I refer to co-created learning and teaching, I include assessment.",
              "I could use the term co-created curriculum, but in this paper I purposely avoid the term curriculum to avoid further complexity due to the widespread lack of agreement over how higher education curriculum is defined and the resulting influence on what students are invited to co-create (Bovill and Woolmer 2018).",
              "Co-creation overlaps with the concept of active learning, which aims to move the student from adopting a passive role in learning to an active role involving interaction between teacher and students, and between students and students.",
              "Active learning practices and definitions vary, but it often involves students participating, interacting, or contributing, whether mentally or physically, in activities to gather information, to problem-solve, and to reflect upon knowledge.",
              "This often involves, for example, activities such as reading, writing, discussion, and small group work, as well as values and attitude exploration (Bonwell and Eison 1991;",
              "Freeman et al.",
              "2014;",
              "Michael 2006).",
              "In co-creation, the purpose, approaches, and outcomes of learning and teaching are jointly negotiated and there is a shared responsibility for learning that implies a greater level of student agency and empowerment than in active learning.",
              "Co-creation involves developing deeper relationships between student and teacher, and between students and other students.",
              "Education is perceived as a shared endeavour where learning and teaching are done with students not to them (Cook-Sather et al.",
              "2014).",
              "While there are many examples and significant discussion in the research literature of partnership and co-creation projects involving small numbers of students, there are relatively few examples in the international literature of whole-class co-creation in learning and teaching within higher education (Bryson et al.",
              "2015;",
              "Mercer-Mapstone et al.",
              "2017).",
              "This lack of attention to pedagogically embedded forms of co-creation between a teacher and a whole class of students is a distinct weakness in the current literature, which this paper aims to highlight.",
              "There are likely to be more instances of whole-class co-creation in practice that have not been captured in written accounts, but which teachers who have a disposition towards more democratic forms of teaching that encourage greater student agency, might describe as \u2018just the way I teach\u2019.",
              "However, this highlights a key question about co-creation in learning and teaching, namely, how does it differ from good teaching?",
              "It is perfectly possible for a student to be engaged and to learn without co-creating learning and teaching.",
              "A teacher might use research evidence to support using interactive teaching approaches for the benefit of students (Freeman et al.",
              "2014), but good teaching does not necessarily require a shift in the power relations between teacher and students that is required for co-creation.",
              "Care is also needed not to assume that good quality evidence-informed teaching involving active learning is common, despite growing evidence that we should \u2018question the continued use of traditional lecturing in everyday practice\u2019 (Freeman et al.",
              "2014: 8413).",
              "Another key consideration in discussing co-creation is to be careful about any claims made about the scale of co-creation.",
              "In a recent UK research study, Mercer-Mapstone and Bovill (2019) highlight that many institutional partnership schemes (the common terminology applied to university-level schemes funding collaborative projects) that might be considered large scale in fact reach less than 100 students per year because they involve multiple projects but each project only includes small numbers of students (with a couple of exceptions).",
              "The authors question whether some co-creation work that is considered small scale\u2014such as whole-class co-creation led by individual, motivated members of staff\u2014are in actual fact reaching larger numbers of students per year than many institutional schemes.",
              "Many \u2018large scale schemes\u2019 are being administered and funded at a macro-level but with predominant influence and impact at departmental level.",
              "In contrast, micro-level partnership activity within students\u2019 programmes of study is often considered small-scale and isolated despite involving potentially larger numbers of students.",
              "This is a key point I wish to emphasise because it has substantial implications for universities and departments wishing to increase co-creation activity.",
              "Several apparently isolated but motivated members of staff co-creating learning and teaching with their classes could involve a moderate number of students in co-creation (depending on the size of their classes) and thereby have significant impact on students.",
              "Motivating more members of staff to teach in ways that embed co-creation may be a powerful way of scaling up co-creation activity\u2014a point that is somewhat overlooked within much of the partnership and co-creation literature.",

              "By doing so, the adaptation of the final application is affected by previous design decisions and both, the developers and the companies that will finance the project, will be forced to carry out two developments: first they will implement the application following a standard methodology, and then they will adapt it to make it accessible.",
              "This adaptation implies an increase in development costs, which means, in many cases, that it is not implemented to save costs.",

              "These researches seek insight into the factors that affect the relationship between user and technology.",
              "In [9], an acceptance model is defined in which the approach consists of considering the perspective of the user\u2019s beliefs, intentions and attitude as determining factors in the use of information systems. This model has been widely studied and criticized (e.",
              "g. in [20, 21]).",
              "In further studies, a change in orientation is observed, putting the user at the center of the analysis when assessing the usefulness of the systems, through the concept of usability.",
              "The work of Brooke [4], who proposed the System Usability Scale (SUS) to measure usability, starts from the basis of taking into account the context of the user in the measurement of the system, understanding the context as the physical, organizational and social features of the user to whom the technological solution is addressed.",
              "This concept has subsequently been expanded by other works, where we find proposals to evaluate the degree of technological affinity through surveys as a tool to measure the user\u2019s level of maturity in the use of the systems [10, 39].",
              "Usability inspection methods have been used over the years to validate software design [15], some of these methods proposed by [30] include the Pluralistic walkthroughs as a way of collaborative work carried out by user representatives, domain experts and developers [3].",
              "Functional dependency is defined by [1] as \u201cFunctional independence is the ability to carry out activities of daily living safely and autonomously\u201d.",
              "In [8], aspects such as the individual\u2019s demographics, cognitive abilities and previous experience in the use of technology are evaluated in relationship to technology adoption as a factor for functional independence.",
              "The findings could be applied in the proper design of training programs for technology users, specially for older people.",

              "g., [18, 34]).",
              "What are the reasons for this gap?",
              "According to the aforementioned study by Raja [34], there are several reasons.",
              "The lack of regulatory frameworks and the higher economic cost in developing accessible technology is one of them.",
              "The absence of awareness, knowledge and capacity to develop these applications is another highlighted reason.",
              "Focusing on the latter, we see that there are reasons originating from the user herself (awareness, knowledge) and from people dedicated to the implementation (development capacity).",
              "One way to deal with this situation is to apply user-centered design from early stages in the development life cycle, which allows creating digital technology for people with a lower degree of maturity in the use of information technology [23].",
              "The work of [19] also highlights the need of a user-centric design strategies for people with impairments and presents a design model that considers user capability and the population profile.",
              "In [41], a successful case study is presented, together with a design methodology for a self-service ticketing system that involves users, in this case elderly people, in early stages of the design process.",
              "This project applies a design method that includes a user needs assessment based on the concept of self-efficacy (\u201cin one\u2019s capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given attainments\u201d).",
              "In the specific case of assistive technology design applied to learning applications for students with disabilities, specifically with visual impairment, we found several previous works and experiences that apply the concept of user-centered design.",
              "Taylor\u2019s study [42] reviews previous works on this subject, as well as various proposals and digital learning tools for this group of users, and proposes to apply the principles of Universal Design in Instructions (UDI), such as the use of information perceptible through accessibility devices and tools (e.",
              "g., refreshable braille displays, screen readers, and screen magnifiers).",
              "The same authors also propose the equitable use of the content to ensure that access instructions are available in formats that allow an equal or at least similar use for students with different abilities and conditions.",
              "Similarly, [38] proposes a development model for multimedia software design for visually impaired students.",
              "It is based on the conversion of 2D and 3D models of the real world to an acoustic representation that the student can perceive.",
              "In this case, the design process begins with the identification of the students\u2019 cognitive skills, for example, problem solving or drill-and-practice exercises on the computer, such as those recommended in [14].",
              "In addition to a model for the design of the application, the author proposes the use of special editors for students and teachers.",
              "The design process includes a usability assessment and evaluation metrics about the impact on cognitive abilities.",
              "Among the recommendations proposed in this work is the application of haptic and auditory technology as an alternative to traditional human-machine interfaces.",
              "Another example that highlights the importance of an adapted design is found in [40].",
              "The authors describe the work carried out in a wide-ranging project for the design and development of a prototype of an e-Learning system for mathematics students with visual impairments (ACED\u2014Adaptive Content for Evidence-based Diagnosis).",
              "They propose a reference framework for the design of adaptive programs, focused on students with visual disabilities for mathematics subjects, where the key to the design lies in the adaptation of the system to the student\u2019s needs.",
              "The authors cover aspects of systems design, as well as the design of training content, learning instructions, and teaching methods for the user community.",
              "They propose adapting the content to the student\u2019s needs through what these authors call micro-adaptation (what content is presented) and macro-adaptation (how it is presented).",
              "Focusing on the design process itself from the point of view of software engineering, many authors argue that software engineering should incorporate the emotion experienced by the user when using the system as a fundamental element of requirement engineering.",
              "They propose the use of \u201cemotional objectives\u201d as a type of requirements in Software design models, and analyze the impact of insufficient specification of requirements from various sources.",
              "It is therefore essential to achieve a design adapted to people with disabilities (visual in the case treated in this article), to allow the generation of these positive emotions and avoid emotions that provoke rejection ([6, 28, 29, 35]).",
              "Any system that deals with disabilities must take into account the voice of the experts as well as that of the end users, the beneficiaries of that system.",
              "Unfortunately, this is not always the case and very often it is only considered after the development, in the testing phase.",
              "This approach (develop first, adapt later) leads the solution into an increased development cost motivated by disability.",
              "RiD, and other models based on the concept \u201cinclusive by design\u201d, propose to transfer that voice to the early stages of development, when it is simple and cheap to decide solutions that later serve their purpose because they are already adapted.",
              "RiD also proposes to include that opinion in all stages of development, from design, to system testing, through the intermediate stages.",
              "Care methodologies such as PCP (Person-Centered Planning) [32], which appeared in the 80s in the context of intellectual disability, used by many assistance associations, such as \u201cPlena Inclusio\u0301n\u201d in Spain [24], show the power of involving people with disabilities in everything that is related to the development of solutions for their integration and normalization in society.",
              "The RiD model follows a process approach to software development as proposed by the ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 standard [16].",

              "4 and 7.",
              "1 of the aforementioned standard covers the recommended activities from the conception and analysis of the user\u2019s need, through the analysis of systems, design, development, validation and testing, to the implementation and post-implementation verification.",
              "RiD is, therefore, conceived as a model that follows the software life cycle approach [33, 36].",
              "RiD particularizes existing models by applying User centric product design, and an iterative process with specific add-ons for disabled users: the user is an active actor in the design and validation of the system from the beginning of the project;",
              "it is recommended to organize the development project based on iterative models in the design and verification phases, involving users with inclusive needs and/or field experts;",

              "RiD is aimed as a general model, but with specific implementation based on the characteristics of the user groups.",
              "In order to achieve this, RiD defines ten specific principles for the software life cycle and implementation of inclusive software applications.",
              "These principles govern the activities of the life cycle, from the conception of the software and the definition of requirements by experts in the field, through iterative design with the user, the joint work between disability experts and experts in the development of inclusive software, up to the controlled and guided deployment by experts and users with disabilities.",
              "It also includes a final phase dedicated to continuous improvement that guarantees that the software will remain valid and applicable even when the user suffers a change in the disability degree.",

              "It must support the use of a braille display;",
              "It should be available for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. Starting from the basic requirements document generated in the previous phase, an iterative requirements validation stage is conducted.",
              "During this stage, two weekly meetings were planned, in which the different work teams studied in detail the initial requirements from a technical point of view: Attending the first of the two weekly meetings was attended by the ONCE education team, the UCM supervisors, and typhlotechnology expert from ONCE.",

              "In the second meeting, the entire technical team of the UCM, together with the typhlotechnology expert, evaluated in detail the feasibility of the implementation of the requirements and designed the architecture to be developed, both at a technological and functional level, taking into account accessibility restrictions.",
              "On occasions, during these meetings, possible modifications of the requirements were also raised in order to create a functional tool in a reasonable time.",
              "It is relevant to note that, during this iterative stage, some aspects considered desirable by Education had to be modified, such as the support for the use of the NVDA tool, due to the integration problems of the revision system.",
              "Development also had to be limited to a single platform, Windows, using the Visual Studio IDE [27] and the C# programming language, since, unlike other development environments, offers specific functionality that greatly facilitates inclusive software development due to its integration with JAWS [26].",
              "In the initial phase of EDICO, user profiles were specified in which the requirements of each user were established.",
              "This does not generate different versions of the program, but adapts the program to the user who is going to use it.",
              "These profiles will adapt the contents to the need, for example, if we import a file in latex and we have set that we have the need for contrast, it will show it and work with the file with the corresponding adaptation.",
              "If the user profile is defined for a blind person, all the content of the program will be adapted with text labels that can work with the screen reader, as NVDA or JAWs, and will be displayed in Braille through the Braille Line.",
              "Once the final specifications had been defined, bearing in mind the feasibility of its implementation within the established time limits, the EDICO editor was implemented in an iterative way.",
              "For each module of the specifications that was being implemented, tests were carried out by two test teams: The sighted teachers of the ONCE Educational Resource Center (CRE) and affiliates belonging to the Braille Mathematics Commission, made up of blind experts in the area of mathematics.",
              "These tests were not only limited to verifying that the application met the specifications, but the team also suggested changes and extensions in the functionality, that were added after being evaluated by the education and development teams;",
              "Once the various EDICO modules met the specifications, a team of blind testers from ONCE, who were not experts in education, but were experts in the management of accessible technologies, checked their correct operation using a standard test form.",
