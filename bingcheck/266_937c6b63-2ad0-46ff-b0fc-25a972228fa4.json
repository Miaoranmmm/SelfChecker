    "query": "What is the most efficient and cost-effective way to store renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, so that it can be utilized during times of high demand or when weather conditions are unfavorable for energy production?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Storing renewable energy is important to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and to ensure a reliable supply of electricity when the weather conditions are unfavorable for energy production. There are many different ways to store renewable energy, but some of the most efficient and cost-effective methods are[^1^] [^2^]:\n\n- **Pumped hydro**: This method involves pumping water uphill to a reservoir when there is excess energy, and releasing it through turbines to generate electricity when there is high demand. This is the most widely used form of energy storage, accounting for more than 90% of the world's storage capacity[^1^]. It is also very efficient, with round-trip efficiencies of up to 85%[^2^].\n- **Batteries**: This method involves using chemical reactions to store and release electrical energy. The most popular type of battery is lithium-ion, which has high energy density, long lifespan, and fast charging and discharging rates[^2^]. Batteries can be used for both small-scale and grid-scale applications, and can help integrate variable renewable sources such as solar and wind into the grid[^1^]. However, batteries are still relatively expensive and have environmental impacts from their production and disposal[^2^].\n- **Thermal energy storage**: This method involves using heat or cold to store energy. For example, molten salt can be heated by concentrated solar power during the day and stored in insulated tanks to produce steam and electricity at night[^1^]. Another example is ice or chilled water that can be produced by excess electricity and used for cooling buildings during peak hours[^2^]. Thermal energy storage can have high efficiencies and low costs, depending on the type of technology and application[^1^].\n- **Hydrogen storage**: This method involves using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and then storing the hydrogen in tanks or underground caverns. The hydrogen can then be used as a fuel for vehicles, power plants, or other applications, or converted back to electricity using fuel cells or turbines[^1^]. Hydrogen storage can offer long-term and large-scale storage of renewable energy, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and industry sectors[^2^]. However, hydrogen storage faces challenges such as low efficiencies, high costs, safety issues, and lack of infrastructure[^1^] [^2^].\n\nThese are some of the most promising methods for storing renewable energy, but there are also other methods such as compressed air energy storage, flywheels, supercapacitors, and gravity energy storage that are being developed and refined[^1^] [^2^]. The choice of the best method depends on many factors such as the location, scale, duration, cost, and environmental impact of the storage system[^2^].",

              "Pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH), or pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES), is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing.",
              "The method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation.",
              "Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps.",
              "During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power.",
              "Although the losses of the pumping process make the plant a net consumer of energy overall, the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand, when electricity prices are highest.",
              "If the upper lake collects significant rainfall or is fed by a river then the plant may be a net energy producer in the manner of a traditional hydroelectric plant.",
              "Pumped-storage hydroelectricity allows energy from intermittent sources (such as solar, wind) and other renewables, or excess electricity from continuous base-load sources (such as coal or nuclear) to be saved for periods of higher demand.",
              "[1][2] The reservoirs used with pumped storage can be quite small when contrasted with the lakes of conventional hydroelectric plants of similar power capacity, and generating periods are often less than half a day.",
              "Pumped storage is by far the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available, and, as of 2020, the United States Department of Energy Global Energy Storage Database reports that PSH accounts for around 95% of all active tracked storage installations worldwide, with a total installed throughput capacity of over 181 GW, of which about 29 GW are in the United States, and a total installed storage capacity of over 1.",
              "6 TWh, of which about 250 GWh are in the United States.",
              "[3] The round-trip energy efficiency of PSH varies between 70%\u201380%,[4][5][6][7] with some sources claiming up to 87%.",
              "[8] The main requirement for PSH is hilly country.",
              "The global greenfield pumped hydro atlas[9] lists more than 600,000 potential sites around the world, which is about 100 times more than needed to support 100% renewable electricity.",
              "Most are closed-loop systems away from rivers.",
              "For example, the United States has about 35,000 potential sites.",
              "[10] Areas of natural beauty and new dams on rivers can be avoided because of the very large number of potential sites.",
              "Some projects utilise existing reservoirs (dubbed \"bluefield\") such as the 350 Gigawatt-hour Snowy 2.",
              "0 scheme[11] under construction in Australia.",
              "Some recently proposed projects propose to take advantage of \"brownfield\" locations such as disused mines such as the Kidston project[12] under construction in Australia.",
              "[13] Water requirements for PSH are small:[14] about 1 gigalitre of initial fill water per gigawatt-hour of storage.",
              "This water is recycled uphill and back downhill between the two reservoirs for many decades, but evaporation losses (beyond what rainfall and any inflow from local waterways provide) must be replaced.",
              "Land requirements are also small: about 10 hectares per gigawatt-hour of storage,[14] which is much smaller than the land occupied by the solar and windfarms that the storage might support.",
              "Closed loop (off-river) pumped hydro storage has the smallest carbon emissions[15] per unit of storage of all candidates for large-scale energy storage.",
              "At times of low electrical demand, excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the upper reservoir.",
              "When there is higher demand, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine, generating electricity.",
              "Reversible turbine/generator assemblies act as combined pump and turbine generator units (usually Francis turbine designs).",
              "[16] Variable speed operation further optimizes the round trip efficiency in pumped hydro storage plants.",
              "[17][18] In micro-PSH applications, a group of pumps and Pump As Turbine (PAT) could be implemented respectively for pumping and generating phases.",
              "[19] The same pump could be used in both modes by changing rotational direction and speed:[19] the operation point in pumping usually differs from the operation point in PAT mode.",
              "In open-loop systems, pure pumped-storage plants store water in an upper reservoir with no natural inflows, while pump-back plants utilize a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants with an upper reservoir that is replenished in part by natural inflows from a stream or river.",
              "Plants that do not use pumped storage are referred to as conventional hydroelectric plants;",
              "conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the electrical grid as pumped storage if appropriately equipped.",
              "Taking into account conversion losses and evaporation losses from the exposed water surface, energy recovery of 70\u201380% or more can be achieved.",
              "[20] This technique is currently the most cost-effective means of storing large amounts of electrical energy, but capital costs and the necessity of appropriate geography are critical decision factors in selecting pumped-storage plant sites.",
              "The relatively low energy density of pumped storage systems requires either large flows and/or large differences in height between reservoirs.",
              "The only way to store a significant amount of energy is by having a large body of water located relatively near, but as high as possible above, a second body of water.",
              "In some places this occurs naturally, in others one or both bodies of water were man-made.",
              "Projects in which both reservoirs are artificial and in which no natural inflows are involved with either reservoir are referred to as \"closed loop\" systems.[21] These systems may be economical because they flatten out load variations on the power grid, permitting thermal power stations such as coal-fired plants and nuclear power plants that provide base-load electricity to continue operating at peak efficiency, while reducing the need for \"peaking\" power plants that use the same fuels as many base-load thermal plants, gas and oil, but have been designed for flexibility rather than maximal efficiency.",
              "Hence pumped storage systems are crucial when coordinating large groups of heterogeneous generators.",
              "Capital costs for pumped-storage plants are relatively high, although this is somewhat mitigated by their proven long service life of decades - and in some cases over a century,[22][23] which is three to five times longer than utility-scale batteries.",
              "When electricity prices become negative, pumped hydro operators may earn twice - when \"buying\" the electricity to pump the water to the upper reservoir at negative spot prices and again when selling the electricity at a later time when prices are high.",
              "Along with energy management, pumped storage systems help stabilize electrical network frequency and provide reserve generation.",
              "Thermal plants are much less able to respond to sudden changes in electrical demand that potentially cause frequency and voltage instability.",
              "Pumped storage plants, like other hydroelectric plants, can respond to load changes within seconds.",
              "The most important use for pumped storage has traditionally been to balance baseload powerplants, but they may also be used to abate the fluctuating output of intermittent energy sources.",
              "Pumped storage provides a load at times of high electricity output and low electricity demand, enabling additional system peak capacity.",
              "In certain jurisdictions, electricity prices may be close to zero or occasionally negative on occasions that there is more electrical generation available than there is load available to absorb it.",
              "Although at present this is rarely due to wind or solar power alone, increased use of such generation will increase the likelihood of those occurrences.",
              "[citation needed] It is particularly likely that pumped storage will become especially important as a balance for very large-scale photovoltaic and wind generation.",
              "[24] Increased long-distance transmission capacity combined with significant amounts of energy storage will be a crucial part of regulating any large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable power sources.",
              "[25] The high non-firm renewable electricity penetration in some regions supplies 40% of annual output, but 60% may be reached before additional storage is necessary.",
              "[26][27][28] Smaller pumped storage plants cannot achieve the same economies of scale as larger ones, but some do exist, including a recent 13 MW project in Germany.",
              "Shell Energy has proposed a 5 MW project in Washington State.",
              "Some have proposed small pumped storage plants in buildings, although these are not yet economical.",
              "[29] Also, it is difficult to fit large reservoirs into the urban landscape (and the fluctuating water level may make them unsuitable for recreational use).",
              "[29] Nevertheless, some authors defend the technological simplicity and security of water supply as important externalities.",
              "[29] The first use of pumped storage was in 1907 in Switzerland, at the Engeweiher pumped storage facility near Schaffhausen, Switzerland.",
              "[30][31] In the 1930s reversible hydroelectric turbines became available.",
              "This apparatus could operate both as turbine generators and in reverse as electric motor-driven pumps.",
              "The latest in large-scale engineering technology is variable speed machines for greater efficiency.",
              "These machines operate in synchronization with the network frequency when generating, but operate asynchronously (independent of the network frequency) when pumping.",
              "The first use of pumped-storage in the United States was in 1930 by the Connecticut Electric and Power Company, using a large reservoir located near New Milford, Connecticut, pumping water from the Housatonic River to the storage reservoir 70 metres (230 ft) above.",
              "[32] In 2009, world pumped storage generating capacity was 104 GW,[33] while other sources claim 127 GW, which comprises the vast majority of all types of utility grade electric storage.",

              "[35] PSH contributed 21,073 GWh of energy in 2020 in the United States, but \u22125,321 GWh (net) because more energy is consumed in pumping than is generated.",
              "[36] Nameplate pumped storage capacity had grown to 21.",

              "Most of them can also not cycle the water endlessly, but only pump and reuse once.",

              "Some, like Nygard power station, pump water from several river intakes up to a reservoir.",
              "The largest one, Saurdal, which is part of the Ulla-F\u00f8rre complex, has four 160 MW Francis turbines, but only two are reversible.",
              "The lower reservoir is at a higher elevation than the station itself, and thus the water pumped up can only be used once before it has to flow to the next station, Kvilldal, further down the tunnel system.",

              "Conventional hydroelectric dams may also make use of pumped storage in a hybrid system that both generates power from water naturally flowing into the reservoir as well as storing water pumped back to the reservoir from below the dam.",

              "How much CO2 is emitted by manufacturing batteries?",
              "Updated July 15, 2022 Lithium-ion batteries are a popular power source for clean technologies like electric vehicles, due to the amount of energy they can store in a small space, charging capabilities, and ability to remain effective after hundreds, or even thousands, of charge cycles.",
              "These batteries are a crucial part of current efforts to replace gas-powered cars that emit CO2 and other greenhouse gases.",
              "These same capabilities also make these batteries good candidates for energy storage for the electric grid.",
              "However, that does come with a cost, as the manufacturing process of the batteries and their components emits CO2, among other environmental and social concerns.",
              "Producing lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles is more material-intensive than producing traditional combustion engines, and the demand for battery materials is rising, explains Yang Shao-Horn, JR East Professor of Engineering in the MIT Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering.",
              "Currently, most lithium is extracted from hard rock mines or underground brine reservoirs, and much of the energy used to extract and process it comes from CO2-emitting fossil fuels.",
              "Particularly in hard rock mining, for every tonne of mined lithium, 15 tonnes of CO2 are emitted into the air.",
              "Battery materials come with other costs, too.",
              "Mining raw materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel is labor-intensive, requires chemicals and enormous amounts of water\u2014frequently from areas where water is scarce\u2014and can leave contaminants and toxic waste behind.",
              "60% of the world\u2019s cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where questions about human rights violations such as child labor continue to arise.",
              "Manufacturing also adds to these batteries\u2019 eco-footprint, Shao-Horn says.",
              "To synthesize the materials needed for production, heat between 800 to 1,000 degrees Celsius is needed\u2014a temperature that can only cost-effectively be reached by burning fossil fuels, which again adds to CO2 emissions.",
              "Exactly how much CO2 is emitted in the long process of making a battery can vary a lot depending on which materials are used, how they\u2019re sourced, and what energy sources are used in manufacturing.",
              "The vast majority of lithium-ion batteries\u2014about 77% of the world\u2019s supply\u2014are manufactured in China, where coal is the primary energy source.",
              "(Coal emits roughly twice the amount of greenhouse gases as natural gas, another fossil fuel that can be used in high-heat manufacturing.)",
              "For illustration, the Tesla Model 3 holds an 80 kWh lithium-ion battery.",
              "CO2 emissions for manufacturing that battery would range between 2400 kg (almost two and a half metric tons) and 16,000 kg (16 metric tons).",
              "1 Just how much is one ton of CO2?",
              "As much as a typical gas-powered car emits in about 2,500 miles of driving\u2014just about the same weight as a great white shark!",
              "Researchers across the globe are trying to design new manufacturing processes or new battery chemistries that can work with more readily available, environmentally-friendly materials, but these technologies aren\u2019t yet available on a wide scale.",
              "\u201cIf we don't change how we make materials, how we make chemicals, how we manufacture, everything will essentially stay the same,\u201d Shao-Horn says.",
              "Despite the environmental footprint of manufacturing lithium-ion batteries, this technology is much more climate-friendly than the alternatives, Shao-Horn says.",
              "In the United States, the electric grid (which is a mix of fossil fuels and low-carbon energy such as wind, solar, hydropower and nuclear power) is cleaner than burning gasoline, and so driving an electric car releases less CO2 than driving a gas-powered car.",
              "\"An electric vehicle running on [electricity generated with] coal has the fuel economy equivalent in the order of about 50 to 60 miles per gallon equivalent,\u201d says David Keith, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management who studies the emergence of new technologies in the automotive industry.",
              "\u201cSo the dirtiest electric vehicle looks something like our best gasoline vehicles that are available today.\"",
              "And an electric vehicle running on electricity generated by hydropower, solar, wind or other low-carbon energy sources can be significantly cleaner.",
              "\"In New England or the Pacific Northwest, the fuel economy equivalent of an EV is into the hundreds: 110-120 miles per gallon equivalent,\" says Keith.",

              "S.",
              "electric grid isn\u2019t currently carbon-free and even when accounting for the initial emissions associated with manufacturing the battery, electric cars still emit less CO2 than gas-powered cars.",
              "2 This is a key feature, given that, within the United States, the transportation sector produces the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions\u2014nearly one-third of the country\u2019s total emissions.",
              "3 A second major environmental benefit these batteries could offer is energy grid stabilization, Shao-Horn adds.",
              "As the world moves towards renewable energy resources, like solar and wind power, demand grows for ways of storing and saving this energy.",
              "Using batteries to store solar and wind power when it\u2019s plentiful can help solve one big problem of renewable energy\u2014balancing oversupply and shortage when the weather isn\u2019t ideal\u2014making it much easier to switch from CO2-emitting fossil fuels.",

              "July 14, 2016 4 min read A California firm is converting sunlight to heat and storing it in molten salt so it can supply electricity when the wind is calm or the sun isn\u2019t shining By Knvul Sheikh The 110-megawatt Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Facility in Nevada is the first utility-scale concentrating solar plant that can provide electricity whenever it's needed most, even after dark.",
              "SolarReserve Deep in the Nevada desert, halfway between Las Vegas and Reno, a lone white tower stands 195 meters tall, gleaming like a beacon.",
              "It is surrounded by more than 10,000 billboard-size mirrors focusing the sun\u2019s rays on its tip.",
              "The Crescent Dunes \u201cconcentrating solar power\u201d plant looks like some advanced communication device for aliens.",
              "But the facility\u2019s innovation lies in the fact that it can store electricity and make it available on demand any time\u2014day or night.",
              "Crescent Dunes, the flagship project of Santa Monica\u2013based firm SolarReserve, has achieved what engineers and proponents of renewable energy have struggled with for decades: providing cheap, commercial-scale, non\u2013fossil fuel electricity even when winds are calm or the sun is not shining.",
              "The facility is touted as being the first solar power plant that can store more than 10 hours of electricity, which translates into 1,100 megawatt-hours, enough to power 75,000 homes.",
              "\u201cWe can ramp up electricity generation for utilities based on the demand.",
              "We can turn on when they want us to turn on and we can turn off when they want us to turn off,\u201d SolarReserve CEO Kevin Smith says.",
              "The trick is to have all those mirrors heat up a massive tank fullof sodium and potassium nitrates that are pumped up to the top of the tower.",
              "There the molten salt can reach temperatures as high as 565 degrees Celsius.",
              "When electricity is needed, the hot salt is used to boil water and produce high-temperature, high-pressure steam, which turns turbines that generate electricity.",
              "The rest of the time, the molten salt can be stored in another insulated tank on the ground.",
              "Molten salt\u2019s physical and thermal properties make it a particularly good candidate for energy storage.",
              "It can be pumped just like water and stored in tanks just like water, says Cliff Ho, an engineer at Sandia National Laboratories who studies heat transfer and fluid mechanics for technologies such as concentrating solar power, but is not involved in Crescent Dunes.",
              "And although a handful of other concentrating solar plants around the world use solar rays to heat water directly into steam, it is much more volatile than molten salt and cannot be easily stored, Ho explains.",
              "That is why the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System in California, the world\u2019s largest concentrating solar-thermal plant at 377 megawatts, has no way to store all the energy it produces.",
              "Although a few other plants like the Solana Generating Station in Arizona have used molten salt as a storage medium, they heat the salt indirectly, using solar energy to first heat other fluids such as oil.",
              "The benefit of using molten salt as both the energy collector that creates steam and the energy storage mechanism, however, is that it eliminates the need for expensive heat exchangers to go between different fluids.",
              "And with molten salt, Crescent Dunes can operate at much higher temperatures than plants using other heat transfer fluids, which makes electricity generation more efficient, Smith says.",
              "Plus, the molten salt medium is cheaper, more environment-friendly, nontoxic and nonflammable compared with oil.",
              "But molten salt technology itself is not new.",
              "\u201cWhat Crescent Dunes brings to the table is that it proves that we can use this technology with concentrated solar power to generate nonintermittent electricity,\u201d says Yogi Goswami, a professor at the University of South Florida and an expert on solar power.",
              "The payoff, he adds, is that 10-hour storage eliminates the need for a fossil fuel power plant to back up electricity production on cloudy days and at peak usage hours in the evening.",
              "It also relieves anxiety for utilities concerned with overproduction of electricity by solar power plants during the day, which sometimes forces them to curtail electricity production or pay customers to take the extra power.",
              "Ultimately, though, concentrated solar power plants must compete on price with photovoltaic power plants that convert sunlight directly into electricity, using solar cells.",
              "The price of photovoltaic panels has plummeted in recent years, making plants cheaper than concentrating solar plants.",
              "But photovoltaics cannot guarantee continuous electricity, certainly not at night, unless they are paired with their own storage medium, which is usually a big bank of batteries.",
              "But Ho says that when the cost of even the best battery technology is taken into consideration, photovoltaics are more expensive than concentrating solar power, which is now down to 10 to 12 cents per kilowatt-hour.",
              "That is still nearly double the goal set by the U.",
              "S.",
              "Department of Energy to reduce the cost of solar power to six cents per kilowatt-hour by 2020.",
              "And skeptics doubt that concentrating solar power, even using molten salt, will be able to match coal- and natural gas\u2013powered electricity.",
              "\u201cConcentrated solar power plants are massive projects, requiring lots of steel and glass, which are unlikely to see significant changes in efficiency or cost,\u201d says Adam Schultz, a senior policy analyst for the Oregon Department of Energy.",
              "He thinks photovoltaic panels and batteries are more likely to drop in cost because \u201cwe continue to see newer technologies in that field.",
              "\u201d SolarReserve\u2019s Smith, however, is confident that Crescent Dunes is just the first of many big molten salt towers.",
              "Concentrating solar power can be scaled up to provide more electricity and meet more of the grid\u2019s demands, he says.",
              "Crescent Dunes is already nearly six times bigger than Torresol Energy\u2019s 20 megawatt demonstration\u00adscale plant that was completed in 2011 in Spain.",
              "And SolarReserve is planning to break ground on a second plant roughly the same size as Crescent Dunes in South Africa later this year.",
              "Other solar-thermal developers also have large towers under construction in Morocco and Chile that will use molten salt.",
              "With the first utility-scale plant completed, costs could eventually come down.",
              "\u201cWe've got a bit of a ways to go,\u201d Smith says.",
