    "query": "What is the most effective and sustainable method for capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions, and what innovative technologies or strategies are being developed to address this urgent environmental challenge?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a collection of technologies that can combat climate change by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil-fuel burning facilities and power plants[^1^]. The idea behind CCS is to capture the CO2 before it is released to the atmosphere and then transport it to locations where it can be stored permanently underground[^1^] [^2^]. This forms a \"closed loop\" where the carbon is extracted from the Earth as fossil fuels and then returned to the Earth as CO2[^1^].\n\nThere are different methods for capturing and storing CO2, depending on the type and source of the emissions. Some of the main methods are:\n\n- Post-combustion capture: This method uses solvents or other techniques to separate CO2 from flue gas after the fuel is burned[^2^] [^4^]. This method can be added to existing power plants and industrial facilities, but it is costly and energy-intensive[^2^] [^4^].\n- Pre-combustion capture: This method involves converting the fuel into a mixture of hydrogen and CO2 before combustion, and then separating the CO2 for storage[^4^]. This method requires a different type of power plant or facility, but it can capture more CO2 and use less energy than post-combustion capture[^4^].\n- Oxyfuel combustion: This method involves burning the fuel in pure oxygen instead of air, resulting in a flue gas that is mostly CO2 and water, which can be easily separated[^4^]. This method also requires a different type of power plant or facility, but it can capture almost all of the CO2 and increase the efficiency of combustion[^4^].\n- Direct air capture: This method involves extracting CO2 directly from ambient air using chemical or physical processes[^1^] [^2^]. This method can capture CO2 from any source, regardless of location, but it is very expensive and energy-intensive compared to other methods[^1^] [^2^].\n\nThe captured CO2 can be stored in various geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs, saline aquifers, or coal seams[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. The CO2 is injected into these formations at high pressure and depth, where it can be trapped by physical or chemical mechanisms[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. The storage sites need to be carefully selected and monitored to ensure that there is no leakage or environmental impact[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].\n\nAlternatively, some of the captured CO2 can be utilized for various purposes, such as enhanced oil recovery, making fuels or chemicals, or producing building materials[^1^] [^2^]. This is known as carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)[^1^] [^2^]. Utilization can help create markets for carbon capture and reduce its costs, but it cannot use up all of the captured CO2, so storage is still necessary for large-scale emission reduction[^1^] [^2^].\n\nCCS and CCUS are promising technologies that could help mitigate global warming by reducing CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel based sources. However, they also face many challenges, such as high costs, technical uncertainties, regulatory barriers, public acceptance, and environmental risks[^1^] [^2^]. Therefore, they need to be complemented by other solutions, such as renewable energy sources, energy efficiency measures, and behavioral changes[^1^] [^2^].",

              "February 23, 2021 Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is any of several technologies that trap carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from large industrial plants before this greenhouse gas can enter the atmosphere.",
              "CCS projects typically target 90 percent efficiency, meaning that 90 percent of the carbon dioxide from the power plant will be captured and stored.",
              "However, CCS could capture more CO2, and thus do more to combat climate change, if industries and governments decide not only to invest in CCS at a large scale but also to pay extra to maximize its potential.",
              "Howard Herzog, a Senior Research Engineer in the MIT Energy Initiative, says that CCS projects have used 90 percent efficiency as a baseline target1 for decades because a system needs to remove at least that much CO2 to be worth the investment to build and install it, and also because 90 percent is an achievable goal.",
              "\u201cThirty years ago, people were still learning about the climate and how much CO2 we needed to get out.",
              "So getting 90 percent of the CO2 out of a coal plant was pretty good,\u201d Herzog says.",
              "Yet meeting ambitious climate targets with this technology will require a leap forward in CCS efficiency.",
              "Consider that untreated exhaust from a coal-fired power plant can contain 300 times as much CO2 as the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which means capturing 90 percent of the CO2 still leaves a lot behind.",
              "Even if CCS could remove 99 percent of the CO2 from coal plant exhaust, what is left would still have a CO2 concentration equal to or higher than the atmosphere.",
              "There are multiple ways to capture carbon dioxide from fossil fuel-burning plants, such as coal power plants or factories that make cement.",
              "In the most common process, the exhaust gas is cooled and pumped into a chamber containing chemical \u201cscrubbers\u201d that bind to CO2 molecules.",
              "The carbon-free exhaust is then released into the air while the captured carbon is concentrated and stored.",
              "CCS has been implemented at two coal power plants (though one shuttered in 2020) and at about two dozen other locations so far.",
              "2 To catch the last remainders of CO2 once a system passes 90 percent efficiency is equal parts engineering puzzle and economics problem, Herzog says.",
              "The closer a CCS system gets to 100 percent efficiency, the harder and more expensive it becomes to capture additional carbon dioxide.",
              "From an engineering perspective, it is easier to capture carbon from a gas with a higher concentration of CO2 because more molecules of carbon dioxide are flowing past the scrubbers.",
              "Grabbing even more CO2 once most of it is gone requires larger equipment, more time, more energy, and a bigger investment.",
              "While there are only a few dozen CCS projects in the world, some of them have exceeded 95 percent efficiency.",
              "Herzog says it is possible to envision the technology capturing even 98 or 99 percent of a power plant\u2019s CO2.",
              "To realize that goal, however, power plants will have to pay a lot more for every extra molecule of CO2 they capture\u2014which means they need stronger financial incentives to cut their carbon emissions.",
              "A carbon price would be one way to create those incentives, by taxing plants on whatever CO2 enters the atmosphere.",
              "\u201cIf you now start looking at carbon prices and you have a pretty high price, that will make it more affordable to go to higher capture percentages,\u201d Herzog says.",

              "Carbon capture and storage is a three-stage process\u2014capture, transport, and storage\u2014designed to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into Earth\u2019s atmosphere by separating it from emissions before it can be discharged.",
              "Captured CO2 is compressed before it is transported.",
              "A similar process called carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) converts some of the captured carbon into concrete, carbonate rock, plastics, and biofuels before storing the rest.",
              "CO2 is a chemical compound that is formed from the combustion of petroleum, natural gas, coal, biomass, and other carbon-containing materials.",
              "CO2 is also a by-product of fermentation and animal respiration, and it is used by plants in photosynthesis to make carbohydrates.",
              "CO2 is recovered for numerous diverse industrial applications from flue gases, limekilns (a furnace for reducing limestone or shells to lime), and other sources.",
              "The buildup of CO2 in Earth\u2019s atmosphere contributes to global warming and the resulting changes in climate.",
              "Roughly one-third to one-half of the CO2 released into the atmosphere by human activities is absorbed by Earth\u2019s oceans, a process that has resulted in the oceans\u2019 steady acidification.",
              "The main pathways used to extract and recover CO2 from a facility\u2019s emissions are post-combustion, pre-combustion, oxyfuel combustion, and direct air capture.",
              "Post-combustion capture uses solvents (such as monoethanolamine, ammonia, and potash) to separate CO2 from flue gas after the fuel is burned.",
              "To do this, the facility\u2019s combustion process is retrofitted with pollution-control equipment that removes CO2 selectively through absorption using amine-based solvents, adsorption (in which gas molecules are pulled toward the surfaces with which they are in contact), chilling, distillation, or passage of the gas through membranes.",
              "The gas is then heated in recovery columns to separate the solvent from the CO2, and the CO2 is compressed to a liquid state where it can be transported.",
              "The advantages of post-combustion technology include the ability to add scrubbers, piping, and other infrastructure to existing power plants and that it is a fairly reliable technology, with some techniques having been developed before World War II.",
              "Conversely, post-combustion carbon capture is more costly, requiring sizable investments in equipment and chemical solvents.",
              "In addition, untreated flue gas often has relatively low concentrations of CO2, which range from 4 percent in gas-fired power plants up to about 14 percent in coal-fired plants, so the removal of relatively small amounts of carbon using this process is expensive.",
              "Pre-combustion capture involves removing CO2 from a fuel, such as coal or natural gas, before the combustion is complete.",
              "The coal undergoes a process called gasification, which partly oxidizes the fuel in steam and a mixture of oxygen and air under high pressure to form a synthesis gas, or syngas, which is primarily made up of methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen.",
              "On its own, syngas can be used to make liquid fuels, burned to produce electricity, or used to power the process of plasma arc gasification.",
              "With additional processing, however, syngas can yield a mixture rich in CO2 and hydrogen gas (H2).",
              "Compared with post-combustion capture, pre-combustion carbon capture is more efficient since the gas feedstock has a higher CO2 concentration (often between 15 and 50 percent), and it can produce usable by-products, such as hydrogen.",
              "While coal-fired power plants and industrial facilities may be retrofitted with equipment that allows for pre-combustion carbon capture, installing gasification infrastructure is often more expensive than the initial construction cost of a new coal-fired power plant.",
              "Oxyfuel combustion capture burns the fuel in an environment of nearly pure oxygen instead of ambient air (which is largely made up of nitrogen), which limits the waste by-products to CO2 and water vapour.",
              "One advantage of this process is that CO2 is much easier to separate from emissions since the mixture undergoes a dehydration process, and no solvents are needed.",
              "As much as 100 percent of the CO2 released by burning the fuel can be captured, and equipment can be fitted onto existing facilities.",
              "To achieve this level of efficiency, however, costs related to both specialized equipment and materials are relatively high, along with the high energy demands associated with the separation of oxygen from other gases in the air and high combustion temperatures that range from 1,650 to 2,480 \u00b0C (3,000 to 4,500 \u00b0F).",
              "Direct air capture (DAC) is a process that extracts CO2 from the atmosphere directly, often well after combustion has taken place.",
              "In this process, air is passed over streams or surfaces of liquid solvents (such as potassium hydroxide, which attaches to CO2 molecules) or solid sorbents (such as amine-based solids and specialized resins) using wind turbines to funnel air into air contactors (or scrubbing towers), where these chemicals reside.",
              "Here, the CO2 is separated from the air\u2019s other components.",
              "As in the post-combustion carbon capture process, heat is applied to release CO2 from these materials so that it can form carbonate salt pellets and other precipitates or be compressed for transport.",
              "Similarly, \u201cartificial trees\u201d\u2014that is, sticky, resin-covered filters\u2014are designed to remove CO2 passively from ambient rather than forced air;",
              "in this process, CO2 is converted into soda ash, which is washed off with water and collected for storage.",
              "Although artificial trees are smaller and remove less CO2 than larger scrubbing towers, they may become attractive alternatives to large-scale scrubbing-tower-style air contactors since they are less energy intensive, less noisy, and far cheaper to manufacture and install than large DAC facilities.",
              "While scrubbing-tower-style air contactors can be scaled to fit existing power plants, large-scale DAC plants are often standalone facilities that are expensive to build.",
              "As of 2023 fewer than 20 large-scale DAC plants had been constructed in the world.",
              "Captured CO2 is transported from plants to storage sites across a network of pipes, with the smaller pipelines leading away from individual facilities to connect with a larger shared pipeline.",
              "The United States, Canada, Great Britain, and parts of Europe all have extensive pipeline networks, some of which date to the 1970s;",
              "in the United States and Canada alone, pipes carry more than 30 million tonnes (about 33 million tons) of CO2 per year.",
              "However, since the captured CO2 is transported under high pressure and often forms acids in the presence of moisture, pipe networks are not immune from leaks or explosions.",
              "Captured CO2 needs to be stored in locations where the gas can be isolated from the atmosphere.",
              "As a result, geologic formations, deep ocean sites, salt-lined aquifers, and emptied oil and gas reservoirs deep (at least 1 km [0.",
              "6 miles]) underground are viewed as attractive locations.",

              "Captured CO2 is compressed before it is transported.",
              "A similar process called carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) converts some of the captured carbon into concrete, carbonate rock, plastics, and biofuels before storing the rest.",
              "CO2 is a chemical compound that is formed from the combustion of petroleum, natural gas, coal, biomass, and other carbon-containing materials.",
              "CO2 is also a by-product of fermentation and animal respiration, and it is used by plants in photosynthesis to make carbohydrates.",
              "CO2 is recovered for numerous diverse industrial applications from flue gases, limekilns (a furnace for reducing limestone or shells to lime), and other sources.",
              "The buildup of CO2 in Earth\u2019s atmosphere contributes to global warming and the resulting changes in climate.",
              "Roughly one-third to one-half of the CO2 released into the atmosphere by human activities is absorbed by Earth\u2019s oceans, a process that has resulted in the oceans\u2019 steady acidification.",
              "The main pathways used to extract and recover CO2 from a facility\u2019s emissions are post-combustion, pre-combustion, oxyfuel combustion, and direct air capture.",
              "Post-combustion capture uses solvents (such as monoethanolamine, ammonia, and potash) to separate CO2 from flue gas after the fuel is burned.",
              "To do this, the facility\u2019s combustion process is retrofitted with pollution-control equipment that removes CO2 selectively through absorption using amine-based solvents, adsorption (in which gas molecules are pulled toward the surfaces with which they are in contact), chilling, distillation, or passage of the gas through membranes.",
              "The gas is then heated in recovery columns to separate the solvent from the CO2, and the CO2 is compressed to a liquid state where it can be transported.",
              "The advantages of post-combustion technology include the ability to add scrubbers, piping, and other infrastructure to existing power plants and that it is a fairly reliable technology, with some techniques having been developed before World War II.",
              "Conversely, post-combustion carbon capture is more costly, requiring sizable investments in equipment and chemical solvents.",
              "In addition, untreated flue gas often has relatively low concentrations of CO2, which range from 4 percent in gas-fired power plants up to about 14 percent in coal-fired plants, so the removal of relatively small amounts of carbon using this process is expensive.",
              "Pre-combustion capture involves removing CO2 from a fuel, such as coal or natural gas, before the combustion is complete.",
              "The coal undergoes a process called gasification, which partly oxidizes the fuel in steam and a mixture of oxygen and air under high pressure to form a synthesis gas, or syngas, which is primarily made up of methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen.",
              "On its own, syngas can be used to make liquid fuels, burned to produce electricity, or used to power the process of plasma arc gasification.",
              "With additional processing, however, syngas can yield a mixture rich in CO2 and hydrogen gas (H2).",
              "Compared with post-combustion capture, pre-combustion carbon capture is more efficient since the gas feedstock has a higher CO2 concentration (often between 15 and 50 percent), and it can produce usable by-products, such as hydrogen.",
              "While coal-fired power plants and industrial facilities may be retrofitted with equipment that allows for pre-combustion carbon capture, installing gasification infrastructure is often more expensive than the initial construction cost of a new coal-fired power plant.",
              "Oxyfuel combustion capture burns the fuel in an environment of nearly pure oxygen instead of ambient air (which is largely made up of nitrogen), which limits the waste by-products to CO2 and water vapour.",

              "Historically, the primary use of oxy-fuel combustion has been in welding and cutting of metals, especially steel, since oxy-fuel allows for higher flame temperatures than can be achieved with an air-fuel flame.",
              "[1] It has also received a lot of attention in recent decades as a potential carbon capture and storage technology.",
              "[2] There is currently research being done in firing fossil fuel power plants with an oxygen-enriched gas mix instead of air.",
              "Almost all of the nitrogen is removed from input air, yielding a stream that is approximately 95% oxygen.",
              "[3] Firing with pure oxygen would result in too high a flame temperature, so the mixture is diluted by mixing with recycled flue gas, or staged combustion.",
              "The recycled flue gas can also be used to carry fuel into the boiler and ensure adequate convective heat transfer to all boiler areas.",
              "Oxy-fuel combustion produces approximately 75% less flue gas than air fueled combustion and produces exhaust consisting primarily of CO2 and H2O (see figure).",
              "The justification for using oxy-fuel is to produce a CO2 rich flue gas ready for sequestration.",
              "Oxy-fuel combustion has significant advantages over traditional air-fired plants.",
              "Among these are: Economically speaking this method costs more than a traditional air-fired plant.",

              "In chemical looping combustion, the oxygen required to burn the coal is produced internally by oxidation and reduction reactions, as opposed to using more expensive methods of generating oxygen by separating it from air.",
              "[5] At present in the absence of any need to reduce CO2 emissions, oxy-fuel is not competitive.",
              "However, oxy-fuel is a viable alternative to removing CO2 from the flue gas from a conventional air-fired fossil fuel plant.",
              "However, an oxygen concentrator might be able to help, as it simply removes nitrogen.",
              "In industries other than power generation, oxy-fuel combustion can be competitive due to higher sensible heat availability.",
              "Oxy-fuel combustion is common in various aspects of metal production.",
              "The glass industry has been converting to oxy-fuel since the early 1990s because glass furnaces require a temperature of approximately 1500 degrees C, which is not economically attainable at adiabatic flame temperatures for air-fuel combustion unless heat is regenerated between the flue stream and the incoming air stream.",
              "Developed in the mid-19th century, glass furnace regenerators are large and expensive high temperature brick ducts filled with brick arranged in a checkerboard pattern to capture heat as flue gas exits the furnace.",
              "When the flue duct is thoroughly heated, air flow is reversed and the flue duct becomes the air inlet, releasing its heat into the incoming air, and allowing for higher furnace temperatures than can be attained with air-fuel only.",
              "Two sets of regenerative flue ducts allowed for the air flow to be reversed at regular intervals, and thus maintain a high temperature in the incoming air.",
              "By allowing new furnaces to be built without the expense of regenerators, and especially with the added benefit of nitrogen oxide reduction, which allows glass plants to meet emission restrictions, oxy-fuel is cost effective without the need to reduce CO2 emissions.",
              "Oxy-fuel combustion also reduces CO2 release at the glass plant location, although this may be offset by CO2 production due to electric power generation which is necessary to produce oxygen for the combustion process.",
              "Oxy-fuel combustion may also be cost effective in the incineration of low BTU value hazardous waste fuels.",

              "[10] The unforeseen loss of the federal CCS Commercialisation Programme, along with decreased subsidies for renewable energy, left the White Rose Plant with insufficient funds to continue development.",
              "[9] One of the major environmental impacts of burning fossil fuels is the release of CO2, which contributes to climate change.",
              "Because oxyfuel combustion results in flue gas that already has a high concentration of CO2, it makes it easier to purify and store the CO2 rather than releasing it to the atmosphere.",
              "[2] Many fossil fuels, such as coal and oil shale, produce ash as a result of combustion.",
              "This ash also needs to be disposed of, which may impact the environment.",
              "So far studies indicate that, in general, oxyfuel combustion does not significantly affect the composition of ash produced.",
              "Measurements have shown similar mineral and heavy metal concentrations regardless of whether an air or oxyfuel environment was used.",
              "[11][12] However, one notable exception is that oxyfuel ashes often have lower concentrations of calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide (free lime).",
              "Free lime forms when carbonate minerals in fuels like coal and oil shale decompose at the high temperatures occurring during combustion (calcination).",
              "Calcination is an equilibrium reaction and a higher partial pressure of CO2 shifts the equilibrium in favor of CaCO3 and MgCO3 respectively.",
              "Free lime is reactive and can potentially affect the environment, for instance by increasing the alkalinity of the ash.",
              "Because oxyfuel combustion takes place in a CO2-rich atmosphere, decomposition is reduced and the ash generally contains less free lime.",
              "[11][12] Flue gas desulfurization is usually employed to increase the pH of flue gases or their product when reacting with atmospheric moisture (acid rain).",
              "Besides sulfur and its oxides, another potential acid rain component is formed from nitric and nitrous oxide interacting with water - eliminating nitrogen from combustion reduces this factor altogether."

              "For subsurface storage, CO2 is injected in its dense (supercritical) phase to a depth where the temperature and pressure keep the gas in the same phase.",
              "This strategy maximizes the use of available storage volume in the pore spaces within a reservoir.",
              "Therefore, the optimum depth for storage is between 1 and 3 km depth4, which is an appropriate depth range for implementing the CSEM technology.",
              "Furthermore, the resistivity of a saline aquifer containing CO2 is dependent on CO2 saturation, and the CSEM measurements will have appreciable sensitivity to increasing saturation changes compared to the seismic velocity, especially in the mid-to-high saturation ranges17.",

              "The question is then: What to do with the captured CO2?",
              "Most current CCS strategies call for the injection of CO2 deep underground.",

              "Capture generally takes place at large stationary sources of CO2, like power plants or industrial plants that make cement, steel, and chemicals.",
              "Most current carbon capture projects use a liquid to chemically remove the CO2 before it goes out the smokestack, but several new types of capture processes are under development.",
              "The captured CO2 gas is then compressed so it becomes liquid-like and transported to a storage site, generally through a pipeline.",
              "Ship transport is more expensive than using pipelines, but it is being considered in both Europe and Japan.",
              "Once at the storage site, the CO2 is pumped more than 2,500 feet down wells into geological formations like used-up oil and gas reservoirs, as well as formations that contain unusable, salty water.",

              "Other possible uses of CO2 include making chemicals or fuels, but they require large amounts of carbon-free energy, making the costs too high to be competitive today.",
              "For large-scale implementation of CCS, utilization is projected to use less than 10% of the captured CO2.",
              "Utilization We emit so much CO2 into the atmosphere that, if carbon capture is going to play any significant part in the fight against climate change, we will have to store most of the captured CO2 underground.",
              "But \u201cutilization\u201d\u2014selling the CO2 as a valuable product\u2014could help create markets for carbon capture, and make it cheaper for companies to invest in capturing their CO2 emissions.",

              "The main pathways used to extract and recover CO2 from a facility\u2019s emissions are post-combustion, pre-combustion, oxyfuel combustion, and direct air capture.",
              "Post-combustion capture uses solvents (such as monoethanolamine, ammonia, and potash) to separate CO2 from flue gas after the fuel is burned.",
              "To do this, the facility\u2019s combustion process is retrofitted with pollution-control equipment that removes CO2 selectively through absorption using amine-based solvents, adsorption (in which gas molecules are pulled toward the surfaces with which they are in contact), chilling, distillation, or passage of the gas through membranes.",
              "The gas is then heated in recovery columns to separate the solvent from the CO2, and the CO2 is compressed to a liquid state where it can be transported.",
              "The advantages of post-combustion technology include the ability to add scrubbers, piping, and other infrastructure to existing power plants and that it is a fairly reliable technology, with some techniques having been developed before World War II.",
              "Conversely, post-combustion carbon capture is more costly, requiring sizable investments in equipment and chemical solvents.",
              "In addition, untreated flue gas often has relatively low concentrations of CO2, which range from 4 percent in gas-fired power plants up to about 14 percent in coal-fired plants, so the removal of relatively small amounts of carbon using this process is expensive.",
              "Pre-combustion capture involves removing CO2 from a fuel, such as coal or natural gas, before the combustion is complete.",
              "The coal undergoes a process called gasification, which partly oxidizes the fuel in steam and a mixture of oxygen and air under high pressure to form a synthesis gas, or syngas, which is primarily made up of methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen.",
              "On its own, syngas can be used to make liquid fuels, burned to produce electricity, or used to power the process of plasma arc gasification.",
              "With additional processing, however, syngas can yield a mixture rich in CO2 and hydrogen gas (H2).",
              "Compared with post-combustion capture, pre-combustion carbon capture is more efficient since the gas feedstock has a higher CO2 concentration (often between 15 and 50 percent), and it can produce usable by-products, such as hydrogen.",
              "While coal-fired power plants and industrial facilities may be retrofitted with equipment that allows for pre-combustion carbon capture, installing gasification infrastructure is often more expensive than the initial construction cost of a new coal-fired power plant.",
              "Oxyfuel combustion capture burns the fuel in an environment of nearly pure oxygen instead of ambient air (which is largely made up of nitrogen), which limits the waste by-products to CO2 and water vapour.",
              "One advantage of this process is that CO2 is much easier to separate from emissions since the mixture undergoes a dehydration process, and no solvents are needed.",
              "As much as 100 percent of the CO2 released by burning the fuel can be captured, and equipment can be fitted onto existing facilities.",
              "To achieve this level of efficiency, however, costs related to both specialized equipment and materials are relatively high, along with the high energy demands associated with the separation of oxygen from other gases in the air and high combustion temperatures that range from 1,650 to 2,480 \u00b0C (3,000 to 4,500 \u00b0F).",
              "Direct air capture (DAC) is a process that extracts CO2 from the atmosphere directly, often well after combustion has taken place.",
              "In this process, air is passed over streams or surfaces of liquid solvents (such as potassium hydroxide, which attaches to CO2 molecules) or solid sorbents (such as amine-based solids and specialized resins) using wind turbines to funnel air into air contactors (or scrubbing towers), where these chemicals reside.",
              "Here, the CO2 is separated from the air\u2019s other components.",
              "As in the post-combustion carbon capture process, heat is applied to release CO2 from these materials so that it can form carbonate salt pellets and other precipitates or be compressed for transport.",
              "Similarly, \u201cartificial trees\u201d\u2014that is, sticky, resin-covered filters\u2014are designed to remove CO2 passively from ambient rather than forced air;",
              "in this process, CO2 is converted into soda ash, which is washed off with water and collected for storage.",
              "Although artificial trees are smaller and remove less CO2 than larger scrubbing towers, they may become attractive alternatives to large-scale scrubbing-tower-style air contactors since they are less energy intensive, less noisy, and far cheaper to manufacture and install than large DAC facilities.",
              "While scrubbing-tower-style air contactors can be scaled to fit existing power plants, large-scale DAC plants are often standalone facilities that are expensive to build.",
              "As of 2023 fewer than 20 large-scale DAC plants had been constructed in the world.",
              "Captured CO2 is transported from plants to storage sites across a network of pipes, with the smaller pipelines leading away from individual facilities to connect with a larger shared pipeline.",
              "The United States, Canada, Great Britain, and parts of Europe all have extensive pipeline networks, some of which date to the 1970s;",
              "in the United States and Canada alone, pipes carry more than 30 million tonnes (about 33 million tons) of CO2 per year.",
              "However, since the captured CO2 is transported under high pressure and often forms acids in the presence of moisture, pipe networks are not immune from leaks or explosions.",
              "Captured CO2 needs to be stored in locations where the gas can be isolated from the atmosphere.",
              "As a result, geologic formations, deep ocean sites, salt-lined aquifers, and emptied oil and gas reservoirs deep (at least 1 km [0.",
