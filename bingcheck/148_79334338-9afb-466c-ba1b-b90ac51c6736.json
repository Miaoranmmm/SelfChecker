    "query": "What is the most bizarre animal mating ritual that you have ever come across in your research, and what is the scientific explanation for this behavior?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. There are many animals with truly weird courtship rituals, but one of the most bizarre ones that I have come across is the **water strider**[^2^]. Water striders are best known for their ability to walk on water, but their sex lives might be what truly sets them apart. Male water striders go directly for mating rather than attempting to court a female partner. The female does have some say in the matter, as she has a genital shield that she can use to prevent penetration. To coerce the female, male water striders tap their legs against the water's surface in a pattern that lures predatory fish. Scientists speculate the risky behavior encourages the female to mate quickly, as she knows that she'll be the first to get eaten if a fish appears. This is why the females try to stay as far away from the males as they can[^2^].\n\nThe scientific explanation for this behavior is that it is a form of **sexual conflict**, which occurs when the evolutionary interests of males and females diverge. Males benefit from mating with as many females as possible, while females benefit from being selective and avoiding costs of mating such as predation risk, injury, or energy loss. Sexual conflict can lead to various adaptations and counter-adaptations in both sexes, such as genital shields, mating plugs, sperm competition, or mate guarding[^2^].",

              "gracilicornis males may have evolved because they increase predation risk to non-responsive females, and because attraction of predators to females that are reluctant to mate when they are mounted by signalling males may decrease their chances of survival compared with females that copulate quickly.",

              "Early critics argued that previous investigators too often considered only males and their genitalia, while overlooking female genitalia or physiology.",
              "Our analysis of the literature shows that overall this male bias has worsened with time.",
              "The degree of bias is not consistent between subdisciplines: studies of the lock-and-key hypothesis have been the most male focused, while studies of cryptic female choice usually consider both sexes.",
              "The degree of bias also differed across taxonomic groups, but did not associate with the ease of study of male and female genital characteristics.",
              "We argue that the persisting male bias in this field cannot solely be explained by anatomical sex differences influencing accessibility.",
              "Rather the bias reflects enduring assumptions about the dominant role of males in sex, and invariant female genitalia.",
              "New research highlights how rapidly female genital traits can evolve, and how complex coevolutionary dynamics between males and females can shape genital structures.",
              "We argue that understanding genital evolution is hampered by an outdated single-sex bias.",
              "The tremendous diversity of male genitalia has been described as one of evolutionary biology's greatest enigmas [1], and several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this diversity (Box 1).",
              "Hypotheses explaining this diversity include the lock-and-key hypothesis of species isolation (in which male \u201ckeys\u201d fit species-specific female \u201clocks\u201d) [2], the pleiotropy hypothesis suggesting that genital morphology is due to pleiotropic effects of natural selection on other traits [3], female choice [4], sperm competition (competition between sperm from different males for an egg) [5], and sexual conflict (occurring when the two sexes have different optimal fitness strategies for reproduction potentially leading to evolutionary arms races between males and females) [6],[7].",
              "An influential 2004 review by Hosken and Stockley [1] concluded that the field has arrived at a general consensus that sexual selection plays an important role in the evolution of genitalia.",
              "A response to Hosken and Stockley [1] by Me\u0301ndez and Co\u0301rdoba-Aguilar [8] highlighted the then well-known problem that the field of genital evolution as a whole paid far too little attention to the role of females in sexual dynamics, arguing that most studies measured male genital traits and ignored females, hence overlooking the intricate dynamics between the form and function of genitals.",
              "However, just as Darwin predicted reciprocal evolution of pollinator proboscis length and floral tube length [9],[10], genitalia in internally fertilizing species ought to involve an evolutionary dynamic between both sexes.",
              "Lock-and-key: Genital divergence is selected for by avoidance of hybridization, where only individuals with matching genitalia can successfully mate.",

              "Three mechanisms of sexual selection are most frequently evoked: 1) cryptic female choice [4], where male genital shape affects female manipulation of sperm;",
              "2) sexual conflict [39], where genital morphology result from a conflict over fertilization control between males and females;",
              "and 3) sperm competition, where variation in male genitalia influences fertilization success through sperm placement or displacement, e.",
              "g., [5].",
              "Despite this obvious statement, variation in male genitalia is most often discussed without consideration of their female counterparts.",
              "It has been repeatedly noted that a lack of study of female genitalia has seriously hampered comprehension of genital evolution [8],[11],[12].",
              "The lock-and-key hypothesis (see Box 1) has been largely dismissed due to lack of variation among females, and hence an apparent lack of a species-specific \u201clock\u201d for the \u201ckey\u201d [4],[13].",
              "However, taxonomic data on female genitalia are scarce, which may explain why studies that have relied on such data have failed to find evidence for coevolution of male and female genitalia [12].",
              "Males are unlikely to have complete control over sperm usage in internally fertilizing species, and females are expected to influence fertilization and hence paternity.",
              "It is therefore appropriate to consider the effects of female genitalia alongside those of the male [8],[12].",
              "Given that the field has greatly expanded since the publication of Hosken and Stockley's review [1], we examined whether the initially observed male bias has changed by analyzing the number of studies that have investigated the evolution of male genitalia, female genitalia, or that of both sexes in each year from 1989 to 2013 (Box 2).",
              "We broadly classify genitalia as male and female structures that physically interact during sperm transfer, but recognize that many studies do not define genitalia and may include additional reproductive structures under that term.",
              "However, since we are concerned about how the field of genital evolution treats male and female structures, we accepted the authors' definition of genitalia.",
              "We also recognize that there are many mostly morphological papers that describe male and female reproductive structures, including genitalia.",
              "While these studies may include valuable information on how genitalia function during copulation, we only included them if they addressed questions about the evolution of genitalia.",

              "7% (159) on both male and female genitalia.",
              "There seems to have been an even stronger single-sex bias toward male-only studies from 2000 onwards (Figure 1) despite a clearly articulated call for greater consideration of the roles of females by Me\u0301ndez and Co\u0301rdoba-Aguilar in 2004 [8].",
              "This bias is seen in most subdisciplines of genital evolution research regardless of whether studies were exploring speciation or aspects of sexual selection (Figure 2).",
              "A notable, and perhaps not surprising, exception is studies of cryptic female choice, where single-sex studies constitute only around 24% of the publications.",
              "Publications exploring the lock-and-key hypothesis show the greatest bias with over 70% of studies only considering male genitalia.",
              "The majority of publications on animal genitalia are based on insects, with spiders as the second most common model.",
              "The taxonomic groups that suffered the least single-sex bias were spiders and gastropods, whereas mammals showed the greatest bias (Figure 3).",
              "Why is there still a consistent male bias in genital studies of internally fertilizing species?",
              "It has been proposed that this bias arises because male genitals are often more rigid and easier to study than female organs [11].",
              "This may indeed have hampered the investigation of female genitals [11], but we question whether this explanation is the sole reason for the pattern of male bias uncovered here, since the bias differs strikingly between different mechanisms investigated (Figure 2).",
              "In many insects the internal genitalia may be soft and membraneous, but given the availability of modern techniques this should not limit research investigations if the investigators are interested in the question.",
              "For example, micro-computed tomography (CT) scanning of millipede genitalia has revealed high complexity in female genitalia as well as large mechanical correspondence between male and female genitalia in copula [14].",
              "It may be that female genitalia with obvious and quite variable external elements encourage further investigation of internal components.",
              "This may explain the high proportion of studies on spiders that considered the interaction of male and female genitalia (Figure 3).",
              "An alternative explanation for the observed male bias is that female genitalia might not vary much, justifying the focus on variation in male organs.",
              "Nevertheless, several detailed studies show significant inter- and intraspecific variation in female genitalia [13],[15]\u2013[18].",
              "For example, spiders show a large diversity in female genitalia among entelegyne spiders and the form of female genitals is very often species-specific [19].",
              "Waterfowl demonstrate extreme variation in vaginal morphology, with some species such as the mallard Anas platyrhynchos having a highly elaborate and convoluted vagina [20].",
              "Other examples include primate genitalia that show interspecific variation in sexual signalling (e.",
              "g., [21]).",
              "Interspecific differences and rapid evolution of female genitalia in sepsid and drosophilid flies [18],[22] suggest that variation in the female tract can contribute to reproductive isolation.",
              "Female genitalia can even be polymorphic within species [15], clearly showing that female genital morphology is rapidly evolving and subject to active selective forces.",
              "Since it was first proposed, sexual selection theory has been influenced by cultural assumptions about males and females, such as Darwin's initial proposal of females being generally \u201ccoy\u201d [23].",
              "Although the mechanism of male-male competition was readily accepted by Darwin's contemporary biologists, female choice was questioned as investigators thought it uncertain whether females had the mental abilities for executing mate choice [24].",
              "In time and due to criticism from female perspectives, investigators have abandoned gender stereotypes, such as females being generally passive [25].",
              "However, males, their characteristics, and behavior have often been the first object of investigation in the field, later followed by questions about females and their characteristics.",
              "For example, sperm competition (male-male competition on the gamete level) was studied a long time before the corresponding idea of cryptic female choice was suggested, and at the time, the latter was generally thought barely credible [26].",
              "Since Eberhard's [27] in-depth treatment of cryptic female choice, researchers have paid more attention to female genitalia since the possibility of cryptic choice forced a more careful analysis of the possible roles of females [1].",
              "Hence, male bias has historically influenced the assumptions and questions pursued in sexual selection research.",
              "Even today the dominant paradigm in the field holds assumptions that steer researchers toward focusing on male subjects more than females: of higher male variance in reproductive success, of males gaining more by multiple mating than females, and of females being choosier and less eager than males [28].",
              "Indeed, the theoretical assumption that male components of sexual selection are more important than female ones may be one explanation for the biased focus on male genitals in the field [11].",
              "The generality of these assumptions is now being questioned and reevaluated [29]\u2013[31].",
              "Another source of bias may be the gender of the investigators themselves, e.",
              "g., are women more prone to investigate variation in females and vice versa?",
              "We partitioned the papers according to the gender of the principal investigator and calculated the percentage of papers focusing on female, male, or both subjects (Table 1).",
              "The table shows that the male bias in studies is equally distributed among female and male authors, hence we conclude that the gender of the investigators cannot account for the observed bias.",
              "Given the difference in bias among different research areas (Figure 2), we suggest that certain research questions steer researchers toward focusing more on males and thus to overlooking female features.",
              "Furthermore, research on different animal groups differs in focus on males/females (Figure 3), which may both be an effect of the sex differences in ease of studying genitalia (e.",
              "g., both male and female spiders have external genitalia) and the kind of questions that are pursued in that specific group.",
              "We conclude that there seems to be no biological justification for why female genitalia are understudied, and suggest that the bias reflects now outdated assumptions about the unimportance of, or lack of, variation in female genitalia in sexual evolutionary dynamics.",
              "While experimental studies exploring how evolutionary forces have shaped female genital evolution are still a minority of the total genital evolution literature, they provide a disproportionately significant insight into evolutionary sexual dynamics.",
              "Rapid evolution of female genitalia can be driven by sexual conflict, as a response to male wounding of females during copulation.",
              "Comparative analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup revealed the rapid evolution of paired pocket-like structures in the female genital tract.",
              "These have evolved to accommodate the equally rapidly evolving paired spines on the male genitalia, and prevent wounding of the female by these spines during copulation [32].",
              "Similarly, in seed beetles males with larger spines on their penises cause more damage to females during mating.",
              "Phylogenetic analysis of the group shows that females have evolved a counter-adaptation to the spines by increasing the amount of structural connective tissue in their genital tract, thereby reducing the extent of wounding by males [33].",
              "Studies such as these demonstrate that the functions of male armaments are difficult to interpret without exploring the impact on females and their evolutionary counter-adaptations.",
              "Sperm competition depends on the coincident occurrence of sperm from more than one male in the female.",
              "There have been numerous studies on the specialized male penile structures that remove competitor sperm from the female.",
              "Too often the female is assumed to be an invariant container within which all this presumed scooping, hooking, and plunging occurs [34].",
              "For example, the male virga of the earwig Euborellia plebeja is considered a classic sperm competition adaptation.",
              "It is as long as the male body, and possesses an apical fringe of hairs.",
              "As the virga is inserted and removed prior to ejaculation, a reasonable assumption is that its structure enables efficient allosperm removal [35].",
              "However, when examining the female genitalia, a different story emerges [36].",
              "The sperm storage organs of the female are longer than the virga of the male, which prevents later mates from effectively removing the sperm of prior males.",
              "Hence, the morphology of the spermatheca limits sperm displacement and enables female control of sperm retention [36].",
              "Changes in female genitalia have also driven changes in male courtship behavior.",
              "In water striders Gerris gracilicornis females have evolved a genital shield, which seems to effectively block forced copulations by males (Figure 4).",
              "As a consequence males have evolved new forms of courtship behavior to advertize to females and attract mating opportunities rather than coerce [37];",
              "but should that fail, males will lure potential predators into the area to presumably intimidate a female into accepting a coercive mating attempt [38].",

              "These vaginal adaptations may have evolved as an anatomical mechanism of cryptic female choice in species in which forced attempted copulations are common to provide an anatomical mechanism to block or limit penetration of the phallus in forced copulation [20].",

              "If a male in a mating position is at a lower risk during a predator's attack than a single male, and if small males can be more easily thrown off by females, then the small males are at a higher predation risk, especially if they have already attracted predators by producing ripples.",

              "There, you\u2019ll find small insects called water striders (or pond skaters), skimming across the water on outstretched legs.",
              "These legs can pick up the vibrations of prey, predators and mates, but they can also produce vibrations by tapping the water surface.",
              "And males use this ability to blackmail their way into sex.",
              "It\u2019s a drama of sexual tension played out across the surface tension.",
              "Water strider sex begins unceremoniously: the male mounts the female without any courtship rituals or foreplay.",
              "She may resist but if she does, he starts to actively strum the water surface with his legs.",
              "Each vibration risks attracting the attention of a hungry predator, like a fish or backswimmer (above).",
              "And because the female is underneath, she will bear the brunt of any assault.",
              "By creating dangerous vibes, the male intimidates the female into submitting to his advances.",

              "A male water strider doesn\u2019t have to go through the hardships of pregnancy and he plays no role in raising the next generation.",
              "It\u2019s a theme that echoes throughout the animal kingdom and it means that the best strategy for him is to mate with as many females as possible.",
              "After all, he has plenty of sperm to go around.",
              "A female, however, has a limited supply of eggs and mating opportunities.",
              "When she has sex, it has to count, so it suits her to be choosy.",
              "And she has the right equipment for the job.",
              "Last year, Chang Han and Piotr Jablonski from Seoul National University found that female red-backed water striders (Gerris gracilicornis) can block their vaginas with hard genital shields.",
              "This defence is important because once the male manages to insert his penis, he can inflate it to make him harder to throw off.",
              "The female\u2019s only hope is to prevent him from getting through in the first place.",
              "Hyper-violent males can sometimes wear the female down but some opt for a subtler approach \u2013 they tap intricate rhythms on the water with their legs.",
              "When Han and Jablonski discovered these rituals last year, they suggested that the males might be trying to demonstrate their quality, by tapping out the most consistent rhythms. Now, they have another explanation \u2013 the tapping is a form of blackmail, a way of coercing sex from the female with the threat of death.",
              "The duo studied the preferences of the backswimmer \u2013 a predatory bug that floats upside-down at the water\u2019s surface and listens out for the vibrations of potential prey.",
              "When given a choice between a silent male water strider and a mating pair with a tapping male, the backswimmer always headed towards the vibrating duo.",
              "And since these predators attack from below, the female was always the one who was injured while the male strode off to tap another day.",
              "The backswimmer menace is so potent that after a few minutes of tapping from the male, the female relents by opening her genital shield.",
              "If she had been previously attacked by predators, she gave in almost instantly.",
              "And only when she relented did the male stop his threatening taps.",
              "But all of this changed when Han and Jablonski prevented the males from sending out their deadly summons by gluing a bar on the females\u2019 backs.",
              "This stopped the males\u2019 legs from touching the water and it made the females much less forthcoming.",
              "On average, they only gave in after 20 minutes and some held out for a full hour.",
              "Of course, it\u2019s possible that the males tap the water for an entirely different reason, and the threat of predators is just a happy side-effect.",
              "But Han and Jablonski found that the males, particularly large ones, actually tap faster when backswimmers are around \u2013 they\u2019re clearly trying to attract these predators.",
              "This predator-summoning strategy probably evolved from more innocuous behaviours.",
              "Water striders already tap their legs to communicate with each other during fights.",
              "And the males of another species, Aquarius najas, also tap their legs during sex but without causing harsh ripples and without affecting female resistance.",
              "It\u2019s possible that these signals originated as a way of demonstrating male quality, as Han and Jablonski initially suggested, before they were co-opted for more sinister purposes.",
              "The battle of the sexes between male and female water striders has led to a whole suite of adaptations and counter-adaptations.",
              "Some males have evolved special grasping structures to give them a better hold of females, while females have responded by evolving spines and other defences to weaken their grip.",
              "Females evolved their impregnable genital shields, which males have countered with a behaviour that makes females more likely to lower their defences.",
              "To be honest, the female water strider has an easy time of it.",
              "In other insects, where females have evolved an upper hand in the war of the sexes, males have developed even more extreme counter-strategies.",
              "Look no further than the common bedbug \u2013 the male bypasses the female\u2019s genitals altogether and stabs his sharp penis straight into the female\u2019s back, a technique known appropriately as traumatic insemination.",

              "CONICET, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Instituto de Investigaciones \u201cGino Germani\u201d, Buenos Aires, Argentina From its very beginning, sociological thought has been concerned with a topic central to our daily lives: social distance.",
              "Since inception, the concept of social distance has referred to the relationships of familiarity and strangeness between social groups, which is experienced in the social world in terms of \u201cWe\u201d and \u201cThey\u201d.",
              "This article covers the main tenets of a Schutzian phenomenological approach to the study of social distance and group relationships.",
              "Specific focus is placed on the different attitudes and valuations of the in-group towards the out-group considered as a stranger, the invisible excess of meaning that emerges in these types of social relationships and the conceptual construction of the Other that explains the phenomenon of discrimination.",
              "\u201cSocial distance\u201d is one of the key concepts being discussed nowadays in international sociology.",
              "Often used to address the study of ethnicity, class, gender, status and other types of social relationships between groups in society, the main idea behind the concept is that \u201cany given social relationship, in addition to other characteristics, always involves elements of \u2018nearness\u2019 and \u2018distance\u2019\u201d (Karakayali 2016), closeness or proximity and remoteness, familiarity and strangeness.",
              "There is, however, a diversity of ways in which social distance is conceptualized as a sociological notion.",
              "Social researchers usually emphasize the affective dimension of social distance, i.",
              "e., how members of a group \u201cfeel\u201d about others.",
              "They also reflect on the way \u2018us\u2019 is distinguished from \u2018them\u2019 in terms of normative patterns.",
              "Some perspectives emphasize the \u201cinteractive\u201d aspect, referring to how long and how often people interact with each other.",
              "In addition, the cultural-habitual dimension is examined by studying the extent to which groups share similar traits.",
              "The question of how these different dimensions interact with each other and with other types of distance (especially spatial) is a salient area of research.",
              "Beyond the multiple aspects highlighted for the study of social distance between groups, another trait to be taken into account is the different attitudes of a group toward alterity in terms of acceptance, tolerance, intolerance, hostility, confrontation and discrimination, among others.",
              "This attitudinal aspect brings to the foreground issues of xenophobia, racism and social inequality.",
              "For contemporary societies, this stresses a significant need for further study.",
              "It is widely noted that, as interactions with \u201cstrangers\u201d intensify, norms distinguishing \u201cus\u201d from \u201cthem\u201d become increasingly problematic in modern societies, giving way to both more tolerant and xenophobic attitudes.",
              "In all likelihood, \u201ctherefore, social distance will continue to be a significant area of research for contemporary scholars\u201d (Karakayali 2016: 2).",
              "As such, the COVID-19 pandemic provides an invitation to reconsider the phenomena of social distance in a new light, as the pandemic has reinforced tendencies toward xenophobia and discrimination.",
              "The \u201cbolstering of national policies and the closing of borders (often accompanied by panicked xenophobia)\u201d (Butler 2020), go hand in hand with a rise in biases against some groups associated with the pandemic.",
              "The case of Asian Americans in the United States illustrates the upsurge in racially motivated hate crimes involving physical violence and harassment (Gover et al.",
              "2020).",
              "Asian Americans have been associated with the stigmatization and \u201cothering\u201d of people of Asian descent, and have experienced verbal and physical violence motivated by racism and xenophobia.",
              "At the institutional level, the state has implicitly reinforced and encouraged this violence through bigoted rhetoric.",
              "According to a report prepared by Human Rights Watch (2020), government leaders and senior officials in some cases have directly or indirectly encouraged hate crimes, racism, or xenophobia by using anti-Chinese rhetoric.",
              "1 According to the report, COVID-19 has enabled the spread of racism and created national insecurity and general xenophobia, which may be related to the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic.",
              "However, discrimination hasn\u2019t been limited to the United States or to Asians and people of Asian descent.",
              "Persistent racist rhetoric in public discourse against foreign workers is also present in India and Sri Lanka, where leaders have done little to stop rising anti-Muslim discrimination.",
              "In the past months, many apparent COVID-19-related cases of attacks and discrimination against Muslims have been reported.",
              "In Myanmar, ultra-nationalist leaders have used the pandemic to justify threats and hate speech against Muslims. Other types of discrimination connected with the pandemic have also been reported.",
              "In Argentina, The National Institute Against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI) reported that since the declaration of the pandemic, average daily volume of claims has increased by 40%.",
              "Cases of discrimination against patients infected with COVID-19 as well as those tested for coronavirus have expanded to include complaints against health workers and Chinese supermarket employees, all of whom are accused of being a \u201csource of infection\u201d (Zayat 2020).",
              "The intent of this article is not to present an in-depth exploration of the phenomena of discrimination and xenophobia reinforced by the pandemic.",
              "Rather, this article takes that issue as its starting point and explores the conceptual tools for approaching the study of social distance from a phenomenological point of view.",
              "The phenomenological viewpoint provides fertile ground for approaching the phenomenon of social distance at both a philosophical and cultural-historical level.",
              "Searching for a solid philosophical foundation of the concepts of social sciences, Alfred Schutz proposed that \u201call scientific concepts of social facts already presuppose a conscious or unconscious theory of the structure of the social world\u201d (Schutz and Parsons 1978: 11).",
              "Following this guideline, this article explores the philosophical foundation of the concept of social distance and its underlying theory of the structure of the life-world.",
              "The first aim is to unravel the sources of unfamiliarity/strangeness contained in the structure of the life-world, which constitutes the conditions of the dynamics of social reality.",
              "A second and closely connected aim is to investigate the ways in which the experience of strangeness in the social world is organized into zones of varying social distance between groups.",
              "In order to achieve these objectives, the article is organized into four main sections.",
              "The first section presents a brief history of the concept in sociological thought.",
              "It is suggested that classical sociologists\u2019 reflection on the issue of social distance is a consequence of the emergence and consolidation of industrial society.",
              "Phenomena such as social classes, the division of labour, the proximity between groups the new society entails, the impact of a new life in a metropolis and the consequent anonymity in social relationships between groups, are interpreted by sociological approach through the concept of social distance.",
              "Secondly, Georg Simmel\u2019s impact on American sociology is analysed and an overview of the intellectual context in which Schutz addresses the issue is offered.",
              "North American intellectual scene provides a different treatment of the phenomenon of social distance, connected to the need to respond to emerging social problems of racism, discrimination, xenophobia and social exclusion, derived from migration and cultural contact in complex societies.",
              "This is also the cross-cutting theme in Schutzian works of the period.",
              "The third section covers the way in which Schutz addressed the issue of the stranger.",
              "Sources of unfamiliarity/strangeness contained in the structure of the life-world are explored using Ilja Srubar\u2019s notions of existential and comparative strangeness.",
              "The fourth and final section presents main traits of a Schutzian phenomenological approach to the study of social distance.",
              "Schutz\u2019s contribution to the study of relationships between social groups is re-established with a focus on the different attitudes and valuations of the in-group towards the out-group considered as a stranger, the invisible excess of meaning that emerges in these types of social relationships and the conceptual construction of the Other that explains the phenomenon of discrimination.",
              "Sociological reflection on the notion of social distance has its origin in the works of three classical thinkers: Gabriel Tarde, E\u0301mile Durkheim and Georg Simmel.",
              "The concept of social distance was first introduced by Tarde in his book The Laws of Imitation (1903 [1890]).",
              "Since its inception, the concept of social distance has referred to the relationship between social groups, to their constitutions as \u201cWe\u201d and \u201cThey\u201d in terms of group membership, and, fundamentally, to a discussion of the stranger.",
              "According to Tarde: Distance is understood here in its sociological meaning.",
              "However distant in space a stranger may be, he is close by, from this point of view, if we have numerous and daily relations with him and if we have every facility to satisfy our desire to imitate him.",
              "This law of the imitation of the nearest, of the least distant, explains the gradual and consecutive character of the spread of an example that has been set by the highest social ranks.",
              "We may infer, as its corollary, when we see a lower class setting itself to imitating for the first time a much higher class that the distance between the two had diminished.",
              "(Tarde 1903 [1890]: 224) Tarde appears to be the first sociologist to propose that the distance between two groups, defined in terms of classes, can be derived from the degree of imitation that exists between them.",
              "As Nedim Karakayali states, in subsequent literature, this emphasis seems to have shifted to the overall result of imitative processes, that is, to cultural similarities.",
              "He maintained that as the degree of imitation between two groups increases, there builds up more cultural similarity and, therefore, increases social proximity between them (Karakayali 2009: 539).",
              "One example of this drift can be found in the work of Pierre Bourdieu (1990), who conceives social distance as the cultural distance between groups and classes that can be mapped in social space.",
              "In Bourdieu\u2019s language, the different agents, groups and institutions that are situated in social space: \u201chave more properties in common the closer they are to each other;",
              "and fewer common properties, the further they are away from each other\u201d (Bourdieu 1990: 127).",
              "As a consequence, and by theoretical, \u201con paper,\u201d approach: \u201cSpatial distances coincide with social distances\u201d (Bourdieu 1990: 127).",
              "However, although it is possible to observe this structural tendency to segregate in space and to affirm that people close to each other in social space tend to be close in geographical space, real interactions tend to be somehow different.",
              "People who are very distant from each other in social space can enter into interaction in physical space.",
              "That is the case of agents who, occupying a higher position in one of the hierarchies of objective space, symbolically deny the social distance which does not cease to exist: \u201cIn short, one can use the objective distances so as to have the advantages of proximity and the advantages of distance, that is, the distance and the recognition of the distance that is ensured by the symbolic negation of distance\u201d (Bourdieu 1990: 127f.)",
              ".",
              "Beyond the important discussion of the links between social and spatial distance, this viewpoint emphasizes that social proximity between groups increases according to the degree of their cultural similarities, which are understood as the result of imitative processes.",
              "Turning to the question of where the concept of social distance originated, it is generally attributed to Simmel, in particular to his \u201cStranger\u201d manuscript (Ethington 1997;",
              "McLemore 1970).",
              "However, although Simmel\u2019s may well have been the first consequential use of the concept in sociology, it had previously been used by Tarde, and \u201cunder the guise of moral density by E\u0301mile Durkheim\u201d (Levine et al.",
              "1976: 835).",
              "Durkheim devised his reflection of physical and social distance in talking about principles of social integration characteristic of organic solidarity.",
              "According to his view, the division of labour progresses the more individuals there are who are sufficiently in contact with one another to be able mutually to act and react upon one another.",
              "This is what Durkheim calls \u201cdynamic or moral density,\u201d a \u201cdrawing together and the active exchanges that result from it\u201d.",
              "As a consequence of these active exchanges, the progress of the division of labour is in direct proportion to the moral or dynamic density of society.",
              "Additionally, moral density is, and should be, correlative to physical density.",
              "In this regard he states: But this act of drawing together morally can only bear fruit if the real distance between individuals has itself diminished, in whatever manner.",
              "Moral density cannot therefore increase without physical density increasing at the same time, and the latter can serve to measure the extent of the former.",
              "Moreover, it is useless to investigate which of the two has influenced the other;",
              "it suffices to realise that they are inseparable.",
              "(Durkheim 1984 [1893]: 202) Proximity between groups then is expressed in terms of social interactions and involves, in Durkheimian words, active exchanges between individuals that result in drawing together morally;",
              "this process is the basis of social integration.",
              "In this respect, the formation and development of towns are, according to Durkheim, a further symptom, even more characteristic, of the same phenomenon.",
              "Towns always result from the driving need of individuals to keep in the closest possible contact with one another: \u201cThey are like so many points where the social mass is contracting more strongly than elsewhere.",
              "They cannot therefore multiply and spread out unless the moral density increases\u201d (Durkheim 1984 [1893]: 203).",
              "Historically, the study of both integration in general and of residential integration in particular has been bound to the study of the city.",
              "The emergence of modern social science was in part a response to the formation of the modern city.",
              "The mass migration from country to town at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution generated new forms of behavior and social problems that called for scientific attention.",
              "The study of integration has its roots in this moment and, in particular, in Durkheim\u2019s work.",
              "He interpreted integration as the degree to which common rules and values are shared.",
              "The notions of \u201cmoral density\u201d or \u201cmoral rapprochement\u201d refer to this context produced by the reduction of spatial distance between individuals (Weinar et al.",
              "2017: 120).",
              "Tarde\u2019s reflection on social distance also has its roots in that moment, specifically as regards the emergence of class society.",
              "Sociological thinking that emerged from this context outlines two possible approaches to social distance: The first, linked to the law of imitation and to the build-up of cultural similarities between groups and, the second one, concerned with social integration and the strength of social ties in the context of the division of labour.",
              "A third perspective, also rooted in the emergence of the Industrial Revolution and its impact on social life, focused around the work of Simmel, who takes as his point of departure the ideal type of the stranger: The sociology of the stranger is a very broad rubric which encompasses phenomena ranging from the initiation of new social relationships to the assimilation of the newcomers and from the effects of the stranger on the social structure and culture of the receiving group to the social-psychological processes which characterizes the stranger\u2019s role within the group.",
              "(McLemore 1970: 87) Reflection on the experience of the stranger opens the horizon to reflect on different modalities of group affiliation.",
              "Moreover, in Simmel\u2019s scheme, the \u201cutilization of the metaphor of distance was by no means restricted to his pages on the stranger;",
              "it constitutes a pervasive and distinctive feature of his sociology as a whole and of his philosophical thought as well\u201d (Levine et al.",
              "1976: 835).",
              "In the following pages, a brief reference is made to Simmel\u2019s work on social distance, and its impact on American sociology is explored.",
              "The presentation aims to elucidate certain aspects of the discussion in which Schutz reflects on the stranger ideal type and the notion of social distance.",
              "Although Simmel reflects upon the sociological form of the stranger in the context of social problems connected to the emergence of industrial society, the reception of his theory by American sociology is produced in connection with new challenges associated with the complexity of the American society of that time and with the emergence of racism, xenophobic attitudes and discrimination.",
              "As will be shown later, it is clear that in Schutz\u2019s work there is a recognition of this context and of these problem areas.",
              "Simmelian treatment of the notion of social distance involves reflection on the way nearness and remoteness are present in every social relationship.",
              "The sociological form of the stranger allows for dealing with not only the proportion of proximity and distance that exists in every social relation but also with the bonds (or connections) between spatial and social sense of distance and the different modalities of group affiliation, i.",
              "e., the in-group and out-group relationships.",
              "The type of stranger he deals with is the \u201cpotential wanderer:\u201d The stranger is thus being discussed here, not in the sense often touched upon in the past, as the wanderer who comes today and goes tomorrow, but rather as the person who comes today and stays tomorrow.",
              "He is, so to speak, the potential wanderer: although he has not moved on, he has not quite overcome the freedom of coming and going.",
              "He is fixed within a particular spatial group, or within a group whose boundaries are similar to spatial boundaries.",
              "But his position in this group is determined, essentially, by the fact that he has not belonged to it from the beginning, that he imports qualities into it, which do not and cannot stem from the group itself.",
              "(Simmel 1950 [1908]: 402) The assertion that the union of proximity and distance is involved in every human relationship must not go unnoticed.",
              "This general trait of human relationships, in the sociological form of the stranger, acquires special features: \u201cit is patterned in a way that may be succinctly formulated as follows: the distance within this relation indicates that one who is close by is remote, but his strangeness indicates that one who is remote is near\u201d (Simmel 1971 [1908]: 143).",
              "The spatial and the social sense of distance also show special characteristics in the sociological form of the stranger: \u201cthe sociological form of the stranger presents the synthesis [.",
              ".",
              ".]",
              "of both of these properties\u201d (Simmel 1971 [1908]: 143).",
              "This synthesis is compounded by a state of detachment/attachment from and to a given point in space, being that spatial relations are determining conditions of relationships among people and groups, and also symbolic of those relationships.",
              "As stated by Dale Mc Lemore when referring to Simmel\u2019s stranger \u201c[.",
              ".",
              ".]",
              "the principal point of interest has been that a person may be a member of a group in a spatial sense but still not be a member of a group in a social sense;",
              "that a person may be in the group but not of it\u201d (McLemore 1970: 86).",
              "All social forms are defined to some extent in terms of the dimension of interpersonal or intersubjective distance.",
              "Some forms, like conflict, bring distant people into close contact.",
              "Others, like secrecy, increase the distance between people.",
              "Some forms organize gradations of vertical distance, whereas other forms organize horizontal distances.",
              "Forms like the stranger entail distinctive combinations of both proximity and distance.",
              "Simmel\u2019s sociology includes a pioneering analysis of the effects of variations in physical distance on social relations.",
              "In this respect, the phenomenon of the metropolis2 shows that the relations between contemporary urbanities resemble stranger relations in most aspects: \u201cSocial boundaries that are so significant in urban stratification exist alongside time/space distantiation, abstract spaces of circulation and exchange and the transpatial \u2018community\u2019 of the money economy\u201d (Frisby 2004: xxxi).",
              "As David Frisby mentions, we are socialized as strangers in the metropolis, and this fact points to the crucial discussion of Otherness.",
              "The modes of interacting with others in the modern metropolis are associated with the creation of social distance.",
              "Sociability is shaped on the basis of the form rather than the content of interaction, which already presupposes distance.",
              "However, this presupposition is not as dramatically perceived as in the exploration of our confrontation with the Other as a stranger: Our more abstract relationship to the stranger as Other, the sense of fortuitousness in our relations with the stranger, our relation to strangers in the city not as individuals but rather as strangers of a particular type, and Simmel\u2019s references to \u2018inner enemies\u2019 and the proximity/distance dialectic in the stranger\u2019s position creating \u2018dangerous possibilities,\u2019 all indicate that this is a crucial discussion of Otherness.",
              "(Frisby 2004: xxxi) The aforementioned synthesis of proximity and distance which constitutes the formal position of the stranger depends on the type of stranger with which we are dealing.",
              "Each type expresses a certain amount of nearness and remoteness.",
              "Although \u201cboth these qualities are found to some extent in all relationships, a special proportion and reciprocal tension between them produce the specific form of the relation to the \u2018stranger\u2019\u201d (Simmel 1971 [1908]: 149).",
              "According to these remarks, it could be stated that different types of stranger allow for expressing different proportions and reciprocal tensions of nearness and remoteness, that is to say, of social distance.",
              "These types also refer to different modalities of group affiliation.",
              "The more abstract the modes of interacting with others are, the greater the risks of transforming them into \u201cinternal enemies\u201d whose membership within the group involves both being outside it and confronting it.",
              "The sociological form of the stranger \u201cwas quickly differentiated from the parent concept and since 1924 has guided an independent and cumulative research tradition\u201d (McLemore 1970: 87).",
              "As mentioned by specialists in the field, the subsequent tradition misunderstood Simmel\u2019s stranger\u2019s traits, which as a consequence, \u201caltered the shape of the concept\u201d (Levine et al.",
              "1976: 830).",
              "That is the case of Robert Park who, taking as his point of departure Simmel\u2019s definition of the stranger to analyze the phenomena of migration and culture contact in complex societies, proposed the concept of the \u201cmarginal man\u201d as a counterpart: \u201cThe emancipated Jew was, and is, historically and typically the marginal man, the first cosmopolite and citizen of the world\u201d (Park 1928: 892).",
              "The marginal man is a person who aspires to have, but is excluded from, full membership in a new group.",
              "Park suggested that various kinds of deviant behavior such as crime, delinquency and illegitimacy, reflected the experience of the persons who, by migrating, had given up old values but had not adequately acquired the norms and skills of their new setting (Levine et al.",
              "1976: 830).",
              "Everett Stonequist, Park\u2019s student, criticized this point by indicating that the marginal man was not identical to Simmel\u2019s stranger who, closer to the type of a \u201cpotential wanderer,\u201d does not aspire to be assimilated.",
              "This is described by Stonequist as follows: \u201cHis relative detachment frees him from the self-consciousness, the concern for status, and the divided loyalties of the marginal man\u201d (Stonequist 1961 [1937]: 178).",
              "In spite of the clarity of Stonequist\u2019s criticism and of the distinction proposed by him between \u201cmarginality\u201d and \u201cstrangerhood,\u201d Park\u2019s interpretation has prevailed as the dominant reading of Simmel\u2019s stranger in the American context of that time: \u201cThe tendency to confuse the marginal man with Simmel\u2019s stranger has persisted\u201d and Simmel has been misread \u201cthrough Park\u2019s distorting\u201d (Levine et al.",

              "Another direction was taken by Margaret Wood, who expanded Simmel\u2019s concept.",
              "She defined the type of stranger as that of the \u201cnewly arrived outsider\u201d: [w]e shall describe the stranger as one who has come into face-to-face contact with the group for the first time [.",

              "For us the stranger may be, as with Simmel, a potential wanderer, but he may also be a wanderer who comes today and goes tomorrow, or he may come today and remain with us permanently.",
              "(Wood 1934: 43f.)",
              "Stonequist and Wood\u2019s works broadened the typology, opened a new path for thinking about a variety of types of strangers, and proposed a more differentiated view of the phenomena, which takes into consideration the proportion of proximity and distance, and different modalities of group affiliation.",
              "As will be shown below, Schutz also expanded the typology and connected its construction with empirical research.",
              "However, the confusion around the different types of strangers \u201chas impeded the development of a more productive sociology of the stranger\u201d (McLemore 1970: 87).",
              "As Dale McLemore lucidly affirmed: \u201c[t]his statement illustrates the tendency of scholars to turn immediately to Simmel whenever the word stranger is mentioned, even when the tradition presented by Wood and Schutz is the more pertinent\u201d (1970: 87).",
              "Simmelian notion of social distance became a prominent concept in American sociology in the 1920\u2032s owing to a collective need to understand the relations among racial groups in the United States (Levine et al.",

              "In 1928, Park\u2019s student, Emery Bogardus, constructed the first statistical measurement scale of attitude and opinions in order to measure racial prejudices.",
              "Taking as his starting point the notion of social distance, he converted it into psychological distance.",
              "Bogardus\u2019 scale distributes numerical values to different types of social relationships ranging from the closest social relations (marriage) to the most distant (hostility and social exclusion) (Marti\u0301nez 1999: 32).",
              "The social distance scale usually consists of five to seven statements that progressively express more or less intimacy toward the group considered.",
              "Typical scale anchors are \u201cwould have to live outside of my country (7)\u201d and \u201cwould marry (1)\u201d.",
              "In this case, a respondent who accepts item \u201cseven\u201d would be more prejudiced than a respondent who marks item \u201cone\u201d or any other item on the scale.",
              "The cumulative aspect also means that a respondent who expresses a given degree of intimacy will endorse items expressing less intimacy.",
              "A respondent willing to accept a member of a group in their neighbourhood will also accept that same group in their country.",
              "Conversely, those who refuse to accept a group in their country will also refuse to accept them in their neighbourhood (Wark and Galliher 2007: 392).",
              "Rephrasing Simmel\u2019s vocabulary in terms of familiarity and unfamiliarity, Philip Ethington (1997) makes a distinction between metaphoric and geometric distance.",

              "Geometric distance is the structure of everyday life in space\u2013time that permits or promotes the formation of familiarity.",
              "In those terms, the stranger is characterized by the fact that he or she \u201cliterally was not here when we developed our familiarity\u201d.",
              "Ethington regrets that Simmelian concept of social distance, in the hands of his successors, \u201cwas impoverished by stripping away Simmel\u2019s geometric sense of distance\u201d.",
              "Moreover, the loss of the spatial sense of distance was accompanied by a neglect of the analysis of social structure.",
              "According to Charles Kadushin, through the writings of Park and Bogardus, social distance entered the terminology of American sociology and \u201cbecame fixed as a social-psychological, rather than as a social-structural factor\u201d (Kadushin 1962: 519).",
              "Yet social distance became \u201cfirmly entrenched in the guise of an attitude scale and was thus largely removed from consideration as an element of social structure\u201d (Kadushin 1962: 519).",
              "This criticism draws attention to the importance of the study of social structure and the centrality of empirical research to approach the links between physical and social distance.",
              "The question as to whether spatial proximity might lead to social proximity, and to what extent social distance between different status, ethnic or gender groups translates into \u201clocational,\u201d remains open for more empirical research (Karakayali 2016).",
              "This general overview allows for diverse ways of identifying the classification of social distance.",
              "Kadushin identified possible categories to classify different types of social distance.",
              "According to his view, there are four dimensions of social distance: Normative, interactive, cultural or valuational, and personal aspects of distance.",
              "Normative distance alludes to role prescription, an aspect that \u201crefers to the manner and degree of interaction which ought to hold between two or more persons or statuses\u201d (Kadushin 1962: 519).",
              "Secondly, \u201cinteractive distance\u201d refers to role interactions, i.",
              "e., the degree of actual interaction, measured as a rate in any given situation.",
              "Thirdly, cultural distance refers to the \u201cdegree of value homophily that exists between two persons or statuses\u201d.",
              "Finally, personal distance or empathy is \u201cthe degree of understanding and unspoken communication that takes place between two persons or statuses\u201d (Kadushin 1962: 519).",
              "Another classification elaborated by Karakayali, proposes that social distance is not a monolithic concept but that there exist diverse forms of classification.",
              "Firstly, it is possible to identify the type of social distance understood as affective distance, i.",

              "his social scale aims to identify the willingness of the members of a group to form certain types of relations (for instance, marriage or working together) with the members of other groups: \u201cWhat the Bogardus Scale measures is what the members of a group feel about another group that they already perceive as being distant\u2044distinct from their own group\u201d (Karakayali 2009: 541;",
              "emphasis added).",
              "Although important, some conceptions of social distance reduce its study to only the affective dimension of distance.",
              "Secondly, social distance can be conceived as normative distance.",
              "Most groups have collectively recognized criteria -norms of inclusion and exclusion- for differentiating \u201cus\u201d from \u201cthey\u201d.",
              "Such norms dictate what kinds of relations the members of a group can form and with whom, and allow distinguishing degrees of membership to a group.",
              "The latter aspect might overlap with the subjective feelings of the members.",
              "It is also possible that a discrepancy occurs between what the members feel and what the normative system dictates.",

              "Granovetter states that \u201cthe strength of a tie is a (probably linear) combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (mutual confiding) and the reciprocal services which characterize the tie\u201d (Granovetter 1973: 1361).",

              "Its importance hinges on the main purpose of his whole reflection, which can be summarized as an \u201cattempt to provide a phenomenological foundation for the basic concepts of the social sciences\u201d (Walsh and Lehnert 1932 [1967]: ix).",
              "In what follows, the phenomenological foundation for the study of social distance is underlined, and the main tenets of Schutzian approach are introduced.",

              "And, on the other hand, they are based on constructive analysis, which refers to the socio-historical expression of the phenomenon.",

              "As far as the experience of strangeness and familiarity is concerned, a \u201cgradation of unfamiliarity\u201d (Srubar 2005: 251) is, in Schutzian terms, a dimension of the structures of the life-world that, at the same time, constitutes a condition for the dynamics of social reality.",

              "Finally, it is open in the dimension of society, in the sense that it includes as essential components of its meaning the life-worlds of my contemporary fellow human beings, the worlds of my predecessors and successors, and everything created by them and possibly to be brought about by their actions.",

              " Advertisement Aquatic Insects pp 295\u2013320Cite as 1337 Accesses 6 Citations The field of sexual selection has been historically dominated by a stereotyped view of the sexual roles, with competing males and selective females, but in recent decades there has been a paradigm switch, with the emergence and dominance of the concept of sexual conflict.",
              "Put simply, there is sexual conflict when the optimum value for a trait (or a group of traits) is different for females and males.",
              "Although the recent literature mainly considers sexual conflict as a process separate from the other well-known processes in the field of postcopulatory sexual selection (sperm competition and cryptic female choice), our approach is that sexual conflict is the consequence of several pressures related to natural and sexual selection, and not a process by itself.",
              "Therefore, here we consider sexual conflict as a part of a continuum of sexual selection mechanisms. We concentrate on the effects of sexual conflict on reproductive behaviour of three groups of aquatic insects, whose habitats differ markedly, water striders, odonates and diving beetles, but also include some examples of studies addressing sexual conflict in other groups of aquatic insects.",
              "Our hypothesis is that the dimensional structure of the habitat will affect the intensity of sexual conflict over mating rate, copulation duration and postcopulatory guarding.",
              "There is abundant evidence and comprehensive reviews of the conflict over mating rates in water striders, odonates and, to a lesser degree, diving beetles.",
              "The bi-dimensionality of the water surface allows an easy monopolisation of females by males in this microhabitat, and water striders conform to this rule, so that the commonest mating system is characterised by strong conflicts and struggles before and after copulation.",
              "For animals like odonates, which are fast fliers and can use diverse terrestrial microhabitats, the opportunities for males to force females to copulate are certainly limited.",
              "In the case of diving beetles, the situation seems more favourable for the females, as they could control male approaches by hiding easily in the vegetation, or even in the case of extreme male density they could fly away and move to a different water body.",
              "The sexual conflict over mating duration is also intense in water striders, and also relevant in the other reviewed groups.",
              "In the field of postcopulatory conflicts, odonates have offered the best examples of male adaptations and female counter-adaptations, which are even more elaborated when studying the evolution of genitalia.",
              "We end by summarising our main conclusions and propose some ideas for future work.",
              "We stress that a comprehensive understanding of sexual conflicts in animals requires the study of both male and female anatomies, as well as their behaviours, avoiding assumptions or gender stereotypes, which have historically biased research to a male-view approach.",

              "Historically, reproduction was seen as an act of complete cooperation;",
              "the idea of sexual conflict instead highlights that cooperation is just one extreme along a gradient that can range from mostly cooperation to mostly conflict between the sexes.",
              "Sexual conflict can occur when the evolutionary interests of the two sexes are not in accord, resulting in opposing selection pressures on males and females.",
              "These conditions are met as males and females differ in their investment in reproduction, and this leads to distinct roles with different fitness optima for each sex.",
              "Both optima cannot be reached simultaneously, resulting in direct selection on each sex to maximize its fitness at the expense of moving the other sex further off its optimum.",
              "This perpetual tug-of-war between the sexes causes novel opportunities for male-female coevolution, which is predicted to result in rapid evolution of sexual traits that can ultimately lead to diversification and contribute to reproductive isolation and hence speciation.",
              "Sexual conflict is a relatively recent theory formulated at the beginning of the 1970s.",
              "Andersson 1994, a classic monograph on sexual selection, only mentions sexual conflict sporadically, and it is not represented in detail as an independent alternative theory to the \u201cclassical\u201d sexual selection theories.",
              "A comprehensive monograph dedicated to the topic of sexual conflict is Arnqvist and Rowe 2005;",

              "When one male mating with multiple females, called polygyny (\u201cmany females\u201d), the female takes responsibility for most of the parental care as the single male is not capable of providing care to that many offspring.",
              "For instance, imagine that a male has established a territory such that he can provide access to resources.",
              "Females that enter the territory are drawn to its resource richness, which may signal that he has good genes for protecting a territory.",

              "Promiscuity generally occurs when a single male is unable to sexually monopolize a group of females, either because the females range more widely than the territory size of a single male, so they interact with multiple males (eg, the maximum territory size a male can defend is smaller than the females\u2019 ranges), or because males and females live together in large social groups that a single male cannot monopolize.",
              "In large social groups, often all females are sexually receptive at the same time, meaning that a single male cannot prevent other males from mating with other females while he mates with one female.",

              "[6] The combination of resource distribution, parental care, and female breeding synchrony determines what mating strategies the limited sex will employ.",
              "Polygyny will occur when resources are localized and females form clusters, making it easier for males to control them.",

              "The polygyny threshold model also shows the effects of female reproductive success when multiple females in the same territory mate with one male.",
              "In this situation, the female has the option of breeding with an unmated male in a poor-quality territory or with an already-mated male in a high-quality territory.",
              "The second breeding female will receive fewer resources from the male than the first breeding female.",
              "However, if the bigamous threshold is higher than the second female's original resource threshold, the female will enter into a polygynous mating system, since she would still benefit from acquiring more resources.",
              "The polygyny threshold model can be applied to more than two females, provided there are enough resources to support them.",

              "Males provide resources to their harem, such as nest protection and varying levels of parental care.",
              "Females in the harem are able to breed at the same time, indicating that harem size and the number of male offspring are related.",
              "[14] The most important factor when determining male fitness is the order in which he arrives to the territory.",
              "Males who arrive earlier increase the likelihood that they will obtain good nesting sites, improving their odds for attracting more females.",
              "Additionally, a greater song repertoire is correlated with an increase in harem size and increased male fitness because females prefer to mate with males that have a more extensive song repertoire.",
              "[14] It is also possible that broad song repertoires are a supplementary cue for a good mate, in conjunction with male territory size and quality.",
              "A wide-ranging song repertoire develops with age, and older males are more likely to dominate better territories, giving a plausible reason as to why females prefer older males.",
              "[15] Although highly debated, female choice in the great reed warbler may be explained by the good genes theory.",
              "False paternity and decreased offspring survival are two factors which might contribute to a decrease in male fitness.",
              "[14] From an evolutionary standpoint, the most predominant characteristic that is often found in polygynous mating systems is extreme sexual dimorphism.",
              "Sexual dimorphism, or the difference in size or appearance between males and females, gives males an advantage in fights against each other to demonstrate dominance and win over harems. Sexual dimorphism can present in larger body size and canine size.",
              "[3] Polygyny is beneficial in particular to the male, because he has a greater increase in fitness and reproductive success.",
              "This increase consequently reduces the genetic diversity of the community, often leading to increased inbreeding.",
              "However, polygyny is not a particularly beneficial mating system for females, because their mate choice is limited to one male.",
              "[6] Extra-pair copulations are a strategy used by females to avoid the sexual conflict caused by polygyny, allowing them access to better mate choice.",
              "Unlike in males, extra-pair copulations are advantageous for females because they present females with more mate choice as well as increase the genetic diversity of the community.",
              "Extra-pair copulations exemplify sexual conflict, a situation in which one behavior is advantageous for one sex, but disadvantageous for the other.",
              "[6] Female choice, the act in which a female chooses her mate based on the attractiveness of his qualities, is very common in polygynous systems. In these cases, females will choose males based on secondary sexual characteristics, which may indicate access to better and more resources.",
              "For example, female great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) have a preference to mate with males with larger song repertoires, because this indicates that they are older and may have better nesting territories.",
              "[14][15] Also, female grayling butterflies (Hipparchia semele) choose males based on their performance in flight competitions, where the winning male settles in the territory best for oviposition.",
              "[16] Female Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) mate with the winners of battles for the harem because the male has shown that he is stronger than another, potentially offering more protection from predators.",
              "[17] Female red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) exhibit aggression toward other females upon intrusion into the harem, usually heightened around breeding season.",
              "This behavior demonstrates that the females are protecting their breeding male from intruding females, suggesting they are preventing female access to a desirable mate.",

              " Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization.",
              "Fertilization can occur either inside (internal fertilization) or outside (external fertilization) the body of the female.",
              "The information below is adapted from OpenStax Biology 43.",
              "2 External fertilization usually occurs in aquatic environments where both eggs and sperm are released into the water, a process called spawning.",
              "Water protects the eggs from drying out during development.",
              "Species that utilize external fertilization might be fully aquatic, like fish and many aquatic invertebrates, or they may be partially aquatic and partially terrestrial (land-based), like many amphibians.",
              "For both types of organisms, getting the sperm and egg together requires that the gametes be released at the same time and in the same location to increase the likelihood of fertilization (otherwise the time and energy to produce all those gametes was wasted).",
              "How does that happen?",
              "The information below is adapted from OpenStax Biology 43.",
              "2 Internal fertilization occurs most often in terrestrial animals, although some aquatic animals like aquatic mammals (whales, dolphins) and some fish (including some cartilaginous fish like sharks, and some bony fish like guppies) also reproduce via internal fertilization.",
              "There are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization: Internal fertilization has the advantage of protecting the fertilized egg from dehydration on land.",
              "Depending on the species, the embryo may also remain within the female, which protects the eggs from predation.",
              "Internal fertilization also increases the likelihood of fertilization by a specific male.",
              "Fewer offspring are produced through this method, but their survival rate is likely to be higher than that for external fertilization.",
              "The statement above is a gross generalization, but biologically it tends to be true across most species that reproduce sexually, whether they reproduce with internal or external fertilization.",
              "Why is this the case?",
              "Generally females invest more in the offspring than a male does, and she has a limited number of eggs compared to practically limitless sperm produced by a male.",
              "If a female mates with a male of poor genetic quality, and if her offspring don\u2019t survive as a result, then she has wasted a lot of energy and resources and ended up with nothing;",
              "evolutionarily, females in this situation are unlikely to pass on their traits to many offspring.",
              "But a male can mate with practically unlimited numbers of females with little loss of energy or resources, regardless of how successful those offspring may be.",
              "In other words, eggs are \u201cexpensive\u201d and sperm are \u201ccheap.",
              "\u201d Thus, generally a female maximizes her reproductive success by mating with the \u201cbest\u201d male she can, while generally a male maximizes his reproductive success by mating with as many females as possible.",
              "In other words, evolution typically selects for \u201cchoosiness\u201d in females but not necessarily in males.",
              "Any situation where one sex (or both sexes) select specific individuals to mate with (compared to randomly mating with any individual) will result in a phenomenon called sexual selection.",
              "Sexual selection is a type of natural selection where one sex has a preference for certain characteristics in individuals of the other sex, thus leading to increased reproductive success of individuals who have that particular characteristic.",
              "It is important to keep in mind that adaptations (anything that increases an individual\u2019s reproductive success) occur without conscious thought or intention on the part of the individual;",
              "see the Biological Principles textbook pages on \u201cWhat is Evolution?",
              "\u201d and \u201cEvolution by Natural Selection\u201d for help with this often confusing concept.",
              "The result of these types of selection is the evolution of different strategies for maximizing biological fitness.",
              "Biological fitness can be defined as reproductive success relative to others in the population.",
              "An individual who has, for example, 10 surviving offspring has higher fitness than an individual who has 7 offspring surviving offspring (even if the second individual started out with more than 10 offspring).",
              "Because females of most sexually reproducing species are \u201cchoosy,\u201d females are often the sex that sexually selects traits in males.",
              "As a result, males compete with each other for access to females and/or induce a specific female to mate with him.",
              "As a result of this competition, sexual selection often leads to sexual dimorphism, or distinct differences in size or appearance between males and females.",
              "These differences in size or appearance are called secondary sexual characteristics, exaggerated or showy, physical traits that are associated with mating behaviors and reproductive success.",
              "Examples include breasts, showy tails and headpieces, and crazier (to us) traits like the length of the eye-stalks in stalk-eyed flies.",
              "Sexual dimorphism can also lead to specific behaviors in males that increase their reproductive success.",
              "In both cases, significant energy is spent in the process of locating, attracting, and mating with the sex partner.",
              "Competition among males occurs whether species mate via internal or external fertilization.",
              "In species that mate via internal fertilization, it\u2019s pretty obvious that multiple males can\u2019t mate with a female at the same time, and thus they must compete with each other.",
              "In species that mate via external fertilization, the female controls how and when the eggs are released, and thus males must compete for access to her eggs outside of her body.",
              "Males often engage in direct male competition over potential mating partners.",
              "This type of competition occurs when females mate only with a single male, typically the \u201cwinner\u201d of the competition.",
              "Direct male competition often includes aggression (fighting) between males, but there are other forms as well.",
              "Examples of direct male competition include: It\u2019s not all just competition between males;",
              "females choose which males to mate with based on observing the male competition.",
              "Selection of the \u201cbest\u201d male by females is called female choice or intersexual selection.",
              "Female choice (intersexual selection) and direct male competition (intrasexual selection) usually lead to selection for extremely \u201cshowy\u201d traits that don\u2019t appear to provide any benefit to the individual\u2019s survival, and might even make it more likely for the animal to be eaten by a predator (think of the peacock\u2019s tail \u2013 see below).",
              "But if the trait improves the male\u2019s ability to produce successful offspring because more females choose to mate with him, then these traits do in fact improve an individual\u2019s biological fitness, even at the cost of decreasing its survival!",
              "One question is why females should \u201ccare\u201d about these showy male traits.",
              "A leading hypothesis to answer this question is the good genes hypothesis, which is the idea that these sexually-selected, showy male traits are \u201chonest indicators\u201d of good genetic quality.",
              "In other words, it takes good genes to make a big flashy tail (and to avoid being eaten by a predator, since that big tail slows him down), so the bigger and showier the tail, the \u201cbetter\u201d the male.",
              "This video gives a brief overview of the implications of the good genes hypothesis and sexual selection in humans: Instead of (or in addition to) competing directly with each other to have the opportunity to mate with a female, males can also compete for fertilization of a female\u2019s eggs after mating has already occurred.",
              "Competing after mating is also called indirect male competition, or sperm competition, and it results in one male being more successful than another at fertilizing a female\u2019s eggs.",
              "This type of competition occurs in species where the female is likely to mate with multiple males, so instead of males directly competing with each other, they are competing via their sperm.",
              "In other words, if a female mates with more than one male, then any male whose sperm end up fertilizing more eggs is going to have more offspring, on average, than other males.",
              ".",
              "So if there is a trait that makes this male\u2019s sperm more successful than other male\u2019s sperm, then that trait is going to end up increasing in the population over generations.",
              "Examples of traits and behaviors which typically confer first male advantage include: Examples of traits and behaviors which typically confer second male advantage include: Female anatomy can also influence the success of sperm from specific males in a process called cryptic female choice, where a female is capable of preferentially using sperm from a specific male even if she has mated with multiple males.",
              "This process is poorly understood but suggests that males competition alone does not dictate success of that male sperm in fertilizing an egg.",
              "This video provides a great overview of sperm competition, but be aware that it erroneously refers to bonobos as having a polygymous mating system (they are promiscuous) and gorillas as being monogamous (they are polygynous): Parental investment is any energy, effort, or resource that a parent provides to increase the offspring\u2019s chances of survival, but at the cost of the parent\u2019s ability to invest in other offspring.",
              "For example, a male songbird will collect food to feed his hatchlings, but he can only collect so much food in a given day.",
              "His investment of that food in one nest of hatchlings means that he cannot support hatchlings in a second nest at the same time;",
              "in this scenario, he supports one nest at the expense of another.",
              "Parental investment can include all types of parental care, as well as energy resources deposited in the egg or other nutrition provided to the developing embryo.",
              "It occurs both in species that reproduce via internal fertilization as well as those that reproduce via external fertilization.",
              "Some examples are shown below: Sexually reproducing animals can be categorized by mating system, which is a general way of describing how males and females pair when mating.",
              "Mating systems are influenced by evolutionary history and environmental/ecological factors, and they in turn influence selection for different types of traits and behaviors in the species.",
              "There are three general mating systems, all involving innate and evolutionarily selected (as opposed to learned) behaviors, seen in animal populations: monogamous, polygamous, and promiscuous.",
              "The polygamous system includes two sub-types: polgynous and polyandrous systems. Monogamy: In monogamous systems, one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season.",
              "In some animals, such as the prairie vole, these associations can last beyond one breeding season and even as long as the breeding pair\u2019s lifetimes.",
              "While there are many non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain selection for monogamous mating systems, one prominent explanation is the \u201cmale-assistance hypothesis,\u201d where males that remain with a female to help guard and rear their young will have more and healthier offspring.",
              "The male-assistance hypothesis is supported by the observation that many monogamous species live in environments with widely scattered resources, meaning that it takes the effort of more than one adult to forage for enough resources to rear the young.",
              "True monogamy, also called sexual monogamy, is where both partners mate only with each other.",
              "Assuming a 50/50 ratio of females to males, true monogamy is the only mating system where there is likely to be no competition for mates.",
              "True monogamy is exceedingly rare in biological systems. Prairie voles are one of the species that appear to exhibit a true monogamy mating system.",
              "Social monogamy, where two individuals partner together to rear their offspring but also engage in \u201cextra-pair copulations\u201d (matings with other individuals,) is much more common that true monogamy.",
              "The vast majority of songbirds demonstrate social monogamy, where up to 40% of the offspring in a mating pair\u2019s nest were not actually fathered by the male partner.",
              "Although each individual is, in principle, guaranteed a mate in social monogamy, there is still some amount of competition for mates in this mating system.",
              "Social monogamy has both advantages and disadvantages for each partner, and these advantages and disadvantages are often related to competition for mates: Polygamy: Polygamy refers to either one male mating with multiple females or one female mates with many males, and includes the subcategories of polygyny and polyandry.",
              "Polygyny: When one male mating with multiple females, called polygyny (\u201cmany females\u201d), the female takes responsibility for most of the parental care as the single male is not capable of providing care to that many offspring.",
              "For instance, imagine that a male has established a territory such that he can provide access to resources.",
              "Females that enter the territory are drawn to its resource richness, which may signal that he has good genes for protecting a territory.",
              "The female benefits by mating with a genetically fit male at the cost of having no male help care for the offspring.",
              "For example, in the yellow-rumped honeyguide (a bird) males defend beehives because the females feed on beewax.",
              "As the females approach to find beeswax, the male defending the nest will mate with them.",
              "Harem mating structures are a type of polygynous system where certain males dominate mating while controlling a territory with resources.",
              "In elephant seals, the alpha male dominates the mating within the group.",
              "Another type of polygyny is a lek system.",
              "In leks, the species has a communal courting area where several males perform elaborate displays for females, and the females choose their mate from the performing males.",
              "Lekking behavior is observed in several bird species including the sage grouse and the prairie chicken.",
              "Polyandry: The other type of polygamy is called a polyandry (\u201cmany males\u201d), where one female mates with multiple males.",
              "Polyandry very rare in biological systems, because it involves sex role reversal where females invest less in offspring while males invest more.",
              "Pipefishes, a close relative of seahorses, are an example of a species that exhibits polyandry where females compete for access to males.",
              "In both pipefishes and seahorses, males receive the eggs from the female, fertilize them, protect them within a pouch, and give birth to the offspring (see below).",
              "However, seahorses are monogamous, while pipefish are polyandrous.",
              "Why do these two similar species differ in mating system?",
              "Ecologically, seahorses live in habitats with widely distributed resources, which means that the seahorse population is spread out and spread thin.",
              "The scattered population means that it is can be difficult to find a mating partner.",
              "Natural selection favors keeping a partner, once found, for reproductive assistance.",
              "In contrast to seahorses, pipefish tends to live in very dense populations in resource-rich environments.",
              "Because the male\u2019s pouches, rather than the female\u2019s eggs, are the limiting resource in reproduction, females compete with each other for access to males.",
              "Promiscuity: Promiscuous mating systems occur when each female mates with multiple males, and each male mates with multiple females.",
              "Promiscuity generally occurs when a single male is unable to sexually monopolize a group of females, either because the females range more widely than the territory size of a single male, so they interact with multiple males (eg, the maximum territory size a male can defend is smaller than the females\u2019 ranges), or because males and females live together in large social groups that a single male cannot monopolize.",
              "In large social groups, often all females are sexually receptive at the same time, meaning that a single male cannot prevent other males from mating with other females while he mates with one female.",
              "Because each female mates with multiple males, paternity is never certain.",
              "The uncertainty of not knowing \u201cwho\u2019s the daddy\u201d selects for males to avoid infanticide, as they may inadvertently kill their own offspring.",

              "Except in the case of sexual (true) monogamy, there is always competition for fertilization.",
              "What differs in different mating systems is whether the competition occurs before mating (direct male competition) or after mating (sperm competition).",

          "Each vibration risks attracting the attention of a hungry predator, like a fish or backswimmer (above).",

          "There is abundant evidence and comprehensive reviews of the conflict over mating rates in water striders, odonates and, to a lesser degree, diving beetles. ",
          "The bi-dimensionality of the water surface allows an easy monopolisation of females by males in this microhabitat, and water striders conform to this rule, so that the commonest mating system is characterised by strong conflicts and struggles before and after copulation. ",
          "The sexual conflict over mating duration is also intense in water striders, and also relevant in the other reviewed groups.",
          "Sexual conflict occurs when males and females act against each others' interest, typically resulting in selection favoring harmful males.",
          "We show that in water striders, aggressive male mating behavior was strongly favored within groups but not favored in a multigroup population when individuals can freely disperse among groups."

          "You can imagine the advantage for a male in this scenario: he helps rear offspring with his social partner, increasing the likely survival of those offspring, but he also mates with other females, thus increasing his total number of offspring (assuming any of these other offspring also survive)."

          "Alteration of the operational sex ratio of adult Drosophila over just a few tens of generations can lead to altered ejaculate allocation patterns and the evolution of resistance in females to the costly effects of elevated mating rates.",
          "Selection experiments that have imposed different mating systems (e. g. monogamy versus polyandry) can reveal the effects on overall male and female fitness of the removal of sexual selection and conflict.",
          "Sexual conflict arises because of the different evolutionary interests of males and females (Parker 1979), and evolutionary approaches can reveal sexual conflict that occurs because of the expression of the same or different genes in males versus females (intra- versus interlocus sexual conflict, respectively, e. g. Rice 1992, 1996).",
          "For example, female D. melanogaster had longer lifespans following single matings to males from lines selected for 47 generations of monogamy, in comparison with females mated to polyandrous males (Holland & Rice 1999).",
          "Together, these studies support the idea that experimental evolutionary manipulations of sexual selection and sexual conflict can lead to significant divergence in both pre- and post-mating traits.",
          "Previously, females from these lines were tested for evidence of female resistance to the costly effects of elevated matings with males (Wigby & Chapman 2004).",
          "Sexual selection can therefore reinforce natural selection and accelerate the rate of adaptation."
