    "query": "What is the most effective method for predicting and preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases, and how have recent advancements in technology and data analysis impacted these efforts?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. There is no single answer to it, as different methods may work better for different diseases and contexts. However, some of the common methods for predicting and preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases are:\n\n- **Mathematical modeling**: This involves using mathematical equations and data to simulate how diseases spread and how interventions can affect them. Mathematical models can help estimate the risk of outbreaks, identify the most effective control measures, and evaluate the impact of public health policies[^2^].\n- **Global disease data**: This involves collecting, analyzing, and sharing information on disease cases, outbreaks, and trends across countries and regions. Global disease data can help monitor the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, detect early warning signs of potential epidemics, and inform prevention and response strategies[^1^].\n- **Vaccination**: This involves administering a substance that stimulates the immune system to protect against a specific disease. Vaccination can prevent or reduce the severity of infections, lower the risk of transmission, and contribute to herd immunity. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as yellow fever, cholera, and influenza[^5^].\n- **Nonpharmaceutical interventions**: These are measures that do not involve vaccines or medications, such as handwashing, social distancing, wearing masks, and quarantining. These methods can help reduce the exposure and transmission of infectious agents, especially when vaccines or treatments are not available or accessible. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are particularly useful for diseases that can be spread through person-to-person contact[^4^].\n- **Artificial intelligence and big data**: These are technologies that use algorithms and large amounts of data to perform complex tasks, such as pattern recognition, prediction, and decision making. Artificial intelligence and big data can help improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease surveillance, diagnosis, forecasting, and response. For example, artificial intelligence can help identify novel pathogens, analyze genomic data, track disease spread, and optimize resource allocation[^6^].\n\nThese methods are not mutually exclusive and can be used in combination to enhance their effectiveness. Recent advancements in technology and data analysis have improved the capacity and speed of these methods, but they also pose new challenges and ethical issues that need to be addressed.",

              "In fact, mathematical treatments have contributed substantially in the epidemiology area since the formulation of the famous SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model, in the beginning of the 20th century.",
              "We presented the SIR deterministic model and we also showed a more realistic application of this model applying a stochastic approach in complex networks.",
              "Nowadays, computational tools, such as big data and complex networks, in addition to mathematical modeling and statistical analysis, have been shown to be essential to understand the developing of the disease and the scale of the emerging outbreak.",
              "These issues are fundamental concerns to guide public health policies.",
              "Lately, the current pandemic caused by the new coronavirus further enlightened the importance of mathematical modeling associated with computational and statistical tools.",
              "For this reason, we intend to bring basic knowledge of mathematical modeling applied to epidemiology to a broad audience.",
              "We show the progress of this field of knowledge over the years, as well as the technical part involving several numerical tools.",
              "Studies involving epidemiology were consolidated in the 19th century although the mortality from infectious diseases has been investigated mathematically since the Eighteenth century [20].",
              "But it was only in 1927, with the formulation of a mathematical model known as SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model [45], by the biochemist Kermack and the physician McKendrick , that the modern mathematical epidemiology indeed began.",
              "Afterwards, many increasingly complex models were created to model epidemic processes, but most of them are based on the concepts of the SIR model [8, 47].",
              "In general, such models are extremely useful for finding out how rapidly the etiological agent, for example, a virus, can spread, how many people will be affected, what containment measures can be taken, what proportion of a population should be vaccinated, etc.",
              "The study of infectious disease dynamics has become very interdisciplinary, in the last decades.",
              "The contributions of mathematics, physics, biology, computer science, statistics and epidemiology are essential to provide effective responses for the development and improvement of public health.",
              "In this context, mathematical modeling appears with a huge potential to clarify the complexity of the dynamics of infectious diseases [30, 40].",
              "Infectious diseases emerge due to environmental, social and demographic factors because we are always in contact with microorganisms or animals that host them [58].",
              "According to World Health Organization (WHO), research and development efforts must prioritize a set of diseases, all of them caused by virus, including ebola virus [16], Zika virus [2], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) [39] and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [28, 50].",
              "Recently, due to the current pandemic caused by the new coronavirus, the importance of mathematical modeling have become increasingly remarkable.",
              "Jargons of the area such as basic reproductive number, infection rate, epidemic threshold, etc.",
              ", are frequently mentioned in news and in social media posts.",
              "In this context, our aim is to provide basic information of mathematical modeling applied to epidemiology to a broad audience and more detailed references for those who would like to learn deeper the topic.",
              "This manuscript is divided as follows: in Sect.",
              "2, we presented a historical background about epidemiology and multicausality.",
              "In Sect.",
              "3 we presented the advances of mathematical models in the context of epidemiological analysis.",
              "In Sect.",
              "4, we presented the mathematical development of the SIR model, its usefulness for modeling a pandemic, its unfolding in other more complex epidemic models and its implementation using complex networks.",
              "Finally, in Sect.",
              "5, we closed this issue presenting some perspectives and challenges of the mathematical modeling related to pandemics, public health, vaccines and infodemic.",
              "Researches involving epidemiology were well-established in the Nineteenth century with pioneering studies about the London cholera epidemic (1849\u20131854) by the sanitarist medical-doctor John Snow.",
              "He became known as the father of epidemiology because he was able to determine the source of infection from a disease, even without knowing its etiological agent [63].",
              "Afterward, the scientist Louis Pasteur determined the etiological agent of diseases, which enabled the introduction of prevention and treatment measures [72].",
              "Previously, this research area had already had contributions from experts as John Graunt, in the Fifteenth century, who quantified the patterns of mortality and birth rates [68].",
              "In the Sixteenth century, Louis Villerme\u0301 investigated the impact of poverty and bad working conditions on the health of the population [43] and Pierre Louis used the epidemiological method in clinical investigations [56].",
              "Edward Jenner, in 1796, discovered the first smallpox vaccine, almost a hundred years before the virus was discovered.",
              "Fortunately, this disease was permanently eradicated from the planet in 1980 due to mass vaccination [67].",
              "Ignaz Semmelweis, in the 19h century, was the first health professional to associate the contamination of hands with transmission disease and he introduced hygiene measures to reduce the spread of pathogens, significantly decreasing the number of deaths from infection in hospitals [77].",
              "Therefore, infectious diseases are a ubiquitous part of human life.",
              "The bubonic plague, caused by a bacteria transmitted to human by the rat flea, reached Europe in the Fourteenth century leaving 50 million dead.",
              "Cholera, known since ancient times and transmitted to people through contaminated water and food, had a first epidemic outbreak in the early Nineteenth century killing hundreds of thousands of people.",
              "Tuberculosis is highly contagious because it is transmitted from one person to another through the respiratory tract [58, 60].",
              "This disease killed a billion people between 1850 and 1950 although trace elements of the disease were found in skeletons 7000 years ago.",
              "In recent years, the infection has resurfaced in underdeveloped countries and currently, together with malaria, they are considered the most important re-emerging infectious diseases in the world [80].",
              "Epidemics of new and old infectious diseases, also known as emerging and reemerging diseases, periodically emerge [57].",
              "They remain among the leading causes of death and can be associated with human behaviours and environmental perturbation [25].",
              "There are many infectious diseases that have plagued humanity for years such as bubonic plague, cholera, tuberculosis, smallpox, Spanish flu, dengue fever, AIDS, etc.",
              "Many of them have caused terrible epidemics and/or cause worrying endemics, especially in tropical and underdeveloped countries [60].",
              "Remarkably, major epidemics of the Twentieth and Twenty first centuries are caused by virus.",
              "The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of infectious diseases in the world, causing more than 700,000 deaths per year.",
              "Many of them are transmitted by a virus through a vector, such as dengue, yellow fever and Zika [80].",
              "Such infections affect more the poorest populations of underdeveloped countries, being classified as neglected tropical diseases [80].",
              "The Zika virus, for example was identified in 1947 among primates in the Zika forest in Uganda but the major outbreak happened in Brazil between 2015 and 2016 and subsequently spread to other countries in South America, Central America and the Caribbean.",
              "Brazil led the discovery of the relationship between the Zika virus and the increase cases of microcephaly in newborns [12].",
              "Another viral disease of global importance is Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), whose outbreak began in the 1980s, that is caused by HIV virus and it attacks the immune system.",
              "There is no vaccine, but treatment can be done with antiretroviral drugs, which also greatly reduces the chance of transmission through sexual relations [32].",
              "In Africa, it is estimated that 17% of adults have the virus, according to WHO [80].",
              "This continent is also the most affected by the ebola virus.",
              "This disease can be transmitted through contaminated meat (bats are usuallys the primary hosts) or body fluids from infected people.",
              "As it manifests severe symptoms, it is easy to identify and isolate the infected individual.",
              "The same does not happen with diseases caused by viruses like influenza and coronavirus [16].",
              "Some strains of the influenza virus, for example, were responsible for the Spanish flu in 1918 [75], killing millions of people worldwide and for swine flu in 2009.",
              "Different strains of the coronavirus were responsible for the 2002 epidemic when SARS-CoV virus caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [28, 50].",
              "In 2012 MERS-CoV virus caused Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [39] and finally, in 2019 , the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, responsible for the corona virus disease (COVID-19) [48], infected 25 million people and killed 848,000 people around the world until August 2020, according to WHO [80].",
              "In general, the symptoms of these diseases are similar and in the beggining not much severe.",
              "People usually present clinical symptoms as fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.",
              "The delay in the manifestation of symptoms (about a week after contagion) combined with mild symptoms that affect the majority of the population are key ingredients that promote a fast spreading of the disease [49].",

              "Transmission occurs through physical contact with contaminated people or surfaces, such as shaking hands or touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, mouth or nose, for example.",
              "Sneezing, coughing and saliva droplets from infected people also transmit the virus, that is why the use of masks and measures related to social distance are so required by health surveillance [80].",
              "In this context, mathematical modeling offers valuable tools for understanding the disease spreading, quantifying the total number of people being infected over time and, consequently, investigating the impact of humans mobility, environmental changes and also the effectiveness of prevention and control measures for developing and evaluating evidence for decision-making in global health [8, 30].",
              "The SIR model is one of the most basic models to investigate epidemic process.",
              "In this scenario, each individual can be in one of three epidemiological states at any given time: susceptible, infected and infectious, or removed which can mean immunized (recovered) or dead [45].",
              "The model specifies the rates at which individual changes their state, as detailed in the netx section.",
              "Originally, epidemic models did not taking into account the heterogeneity in contact behavior not even the mobility of the agents involved in the disease transmission process.",
              "The simplest theory of epidemic spreading assumes that the population can be divided into different compartments according to the stage of the disease as susceptible, infected or removed, for the SIR model, for example.",
              "However, individuals are assumed to be identical and have approximately the same number of neighbors.",
              "From this elementary approach, we are able to write a time evolution equation for the number of infected individuals and finally, we can obtain relevant informations about the disease spreading.",

              "Over the past few decades, the increase sophistication of epidemic models, the advance in the computational system and the use of complex network tools combine with big data provide opportunities to predict epidemic outbreaks and control strategies in an accurate and increasingly realistic way [8, 11, 40, 47].",
              "There are many works in the literature that can exemplify the advancement in mathematical modeling [3, 44].",
              "For instance, to model the measles outbreak in children, the models considered age groups, spatial and temporal features and metapopulation structured [24, 38, 82].",
              "Metapopulation is a set of populations, separated in space, but connected with each other allowing the movement of people between them [21].",
              "When it concerns about infectious diseases transmitted by a vector, such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika and leishmaniasis, the modeling involves at least two host species and environmental conditions should be considered.",
              "In this case, multilayer networks [37] have shown to be useful because they are composed by two distinc layers, for instance, one representing the human population and its mobility, and the other representing the same for the vector\u2014a mosquito, for example\u2014that transmits the disease to humans.",

              "Novel emerging infections such as SARS, MERS, and SARS-Cov2 required models that take into account contact tracing, quarantine, human mobility patterns, intervetions measures, latency period, comorbidities, age groups and impact of vaccines.",
              "Besides that, social mixing patterns, the urban demography and spatial dynamics also have to be taken into account as they directly impact on the transmission of infectious diseases.",
              "[46, 51, 53].",
              "To implement and to investigate the spread of infectious diseases we can used a set of approaches: deterministic, stochastic, agent-based, or a mixed of them.",

              "Most of them are based on compartment models, this means, the populations of individuals are divided in different compartments, where each compartment represents a specific stage of the disease [30].",
              "In a stochastic framework, the transition probabilities of one compartment to another can be modeled by a continuous time Markov process [1, 76].",
              "However, these probabilities can be approximated, in the deterministic approach, by a differential form.",
              "In this case, the set of ordinary differential equations describe how the system evolve in time [69, 74].",
              "Besides that, statistical approaches can also be used to model epidemic dynamics, mainly when it involves concerns related to the spatio-temporal behavior of the disease [6, 41, 66].",
              "In general, all of these models try to capture the complexity of the real-world such as mobility patterns, social contacts, age stratification and spatial distribution of the population.",
              "The deterministic investigation of epidemic models is already sufficient to provide us a basic description of an epidemic, such as the existence of an epidemic threshold that separates a phase where the epidemic grows exponentially from a disease-free state [54].",
              "It is due to the existence of this threshold that disease control measures can be introduced.",
              "On the other hand, stochastic models, associated with Monte Carlos simulations, are useful to investigate epidemic models on networks [4, 36, 62, 64].",
              "In this scenario, each individual of a population is represented by a vertex or a node of the network and the transmission of the disease occurs through edges connecting them.",
              "This framework provides a more realistic perspective, since we are able to investigate the epidemic spreading on large and highly heterogeneous systems. In the next section, we describe both deterministic and stochastic approaches to explore the SIR model.",

              "The SIR model becomes a famous epidemic model because despite its simplicity, it is able to predict an essential feature for epidemiology: epidemic threshold.",
              "It separates two distinct states of the epidemic: disease free scenario and a state of there are a significant quantity of infected people [54].",
              "There are many other models more complex than the SIR model, but almost all of them are based on the SIR rules, that describes very well the dynamic of an epidemic [62].",
              "We firstly investigated this successful model using a deterministic approach and after we implemented this model in networks using the stochastic framework.",
              "In this model [45], the population is divided in three compartments: susceptible S, infected I or removed R.",
              "Susceptible individuals are at risk of getting the disease, if they have some contact with an infected one.",
              "If it happens, the susceptible individual becomes infected and, consequently, he/she is able to disseminate the virus.",
              "Generally, there are two possibilities for infected people, to heal and become immune or, unfortunately, to die.",
              "Both of cases are equivalent from a mathematical point of view because they do not transmit the virus anymore and pass to the removed class.",
              "Besides the SIR model, there are other models that include more compartments and that can be useful depending on the type of disease one wants to model.",
              "For example, in the SEIR model, we consider a latent period, called Exposed (E), in which an individual is infected but it still does not transmit the virus.",
              "This stage corresponds to an intermediate period between susceptible and infected.",
              "We can also include a differentiation between recovered and dead individuals through the inclusion of compartment D (dead).",
              "In this case, we have a SEIRD model.",
              "Another example is the famous SIRS model, in which the individual has only temporary immunity, and may become susceptible to the disease again after a certain time [64].",
              "Recently, Arenas and collaborators [5] proposed a model to study the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic based on 10 compartments.",
              "According to this work, the population is divided into: susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatic infectious (A), symptomatic infectious (I), to be admitted in ICU (pre hospitalized in ICU,PH), fatal prognosis (predeceased,PD), admitted in ICU that will recover (HR) or decease (HD), recovered (R), and deceased(D).",
              "Thus we can then conclude that, according to the complexity of the investigated disease, many compartments can be incorporated into the model.",
              "However, it is interesting to note that, despite its simplicity, the SIR model is able to capture essential features of an ordinary epidemic, such as the fact that social distancing measures work very well and that vaccination is really the best strategy to contain its spreading, as we will show below.",
              "Therefore, in this work we are going to focus on this model.",
              "If the reader wants to know more details about the other models, we recommend reading references [30, 64].",
              "In the SIR model, we considered that the size N of population remains constant, this means: N=S(t)+I(t)+R(t), where X(t) represents the population of the compartment X in a given time step t.",
              "So, S(t)/N is the fraction of the population that can be infected.",
              "Let\u2019s suppose that each infected individual has, on average, \u03bc contacts, then \u03bcS(t)I(t)/N daily meetings can result in contagion.",
              "However, it is reasonable to assume that only a fraction of those meetings \u03c4<1 effectively results in contagion.",
              "Consequently, the number of new infected people in the next day will be [45]: But the number of infected people also decreases as long as they become recovered or dead.",
              "If the mean recovered time is D days, a fraction \u03b2=1/D of infected will become recovered every day.",
              "Finally, the number of total infected in the next day can given by: where \u0394t is the unit of time that corresponds to an specific time interval, which can denote, for example, one day.",
              "If N has a large value, we can consider that the variables are continuous when we make the interval of time smaller and smaller, that is: In the beginning of a new epidemic, that corresponds to t=0 in our mathematical approach, we can assume a commonly hypothesis that practically all individuals are susceptible1 - except the zero individual\u2014it means S(t=0)\u2248N.",
              "This value remains pretty constant in the first steps of the contagion.",

              "If \u03bbS(0)-\u03b2>0, the number of infected grows exponentially.",
              "However, if \u03bbS(0)-\u03b2<0, the number of infected people decreases until the complete extinction of the epidemic.",
              "The value \u03bbS(0)/\u03b2=1 is the epidemic threshold, which separates two distinct phases of the epidemic.",
              "When the initial condition corresponds to all susceptible people, as happened in the COVID-19 spreading for example, we have a particular case when the value \u03bbS(0)/\u03b2=\u03bbN/\u03b2 is known as the basic reproductive number and it measures the \u201cintensity of the contagion\u201d, this means, the quantity of contagion that each infected person can cause.",
              "It means that the number of infected will increase because \u03bbS(t)/\u03b2>1.",
              "On the other hand, when we look at how the number of susceptible people changes over time, we concluded that this quantity will always decreases with time because Therefore, there will be a time when the quantity \u03bbS(t)/\u03b2 will become smaller than one, and consequently, the number of infected will start to decrease.",
              "That is, the number of infected individuals grows exponentially fast at the beginning of the epidemic, reaches a peak and begins to decline as we show in Fig.",

              "This is the natural behavior of an epidemic.",

              "This shows us there are other strategies that can be adopted by governments and the entire population to mitigate the epidemic.",
              "Indeed, the most efficient measure that would cause minor impact on society is mass vaccination.",
              "If that happened at the beginning of the epidemic, few people would be infected because the quantity S(t) would already start with a reduced value, quickly extinguishing the epidemic (see Fig.",

              "This explain why such measures of social distance are very important: the peak reduction, that is, the reduction of people that are infected simultaneously, avoids overloading health systems. How long a person remains infected is also a relevant factor.",

              "We show the difference between the infected curve over time when the contagion is reduced.",

              "Studies involving epidemiology were consolidated in the 19th century although the mortality from infectious diseases has been investigated mathematically since the Eighteenth century [20].",
              "But it was only in 1927, with the formulation of a mathematical model known as SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model [45], by the biochemist Kermack and the physician McKendrick , that the modern mathematical epidemiology indeed began.",
              "Afterwards, many increasingly complex models were created to model epidemic processes, but most of them are based on the concepts of the SIR model [8, 47].",
              "In general, such models are extremely useful for finding out how rapidly the etiological agent, for example, a virus, can spread, how many people will be affected, what containment measures can be taken, what proportion of a population should be vaccinated, etc.",

              "He became known as the father of epidemiology because he was able to determine the source of infection from a disease, even without knowing its etiological agent [63].",
              "Afterward, the scientist Louis Pasteur determined the etiological agent of diseases, which enabled the introduction of prevention and treatment measures [72].",
              "Previously, this research area had already had contributions from experts as John Graunt, in the Fifteenth century, who quantified the patterns of mortality and birth rates [68].",

              "Ignaz Semmelweis, in the 19h century, was the first health professional to associate the contamination of hands with transmission disease and he introduced hygiene measures to reduce the spread of pathogens, significantly decreasing the number of deaths from infection in hospitals [77].",

              "Such infections affect more the poorest populations of underdeveloped countries, being classified as neglected tropical diseases [80].",
              "The Zika virus, for example was identified in 1947 among primates in the Zika forest in Uganda but the major outbreak happened in Brazil between 2015 and 2016 and subsequently spread to other countries in South America, Central America and the Caribbean.",

              "This continent is also the most affected by the ebola virus.",
              "This disease can be transmitted through contaminated meat (bats are usuallys the primary hosts) or body fluids from infected people.",
              "As it manifests severe symptoms, it is easy to identify and isolate the infected individual.",
              "The same does not happen with diseases caused by viruses like influenza and coronavirus [16].",
              "Some strains of the influenza virus, for example, were responsible for the Spanish flu in 1918 [75], killing millions of people worldwide and for swine flu in 2009.",
              "Different strains of the coronavirus were responsible for the 2002 epidemic when SARS-CoV virus caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [28, 50].",
              "In 2012 MERS-CoV virus caused Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [39] and finally, in 2019 , the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, responsible for the corona virus disease (COVID-19) [48], infected 25 million people and killed 848,000 people around the world until August 2020, according to WHO [80].",
              "In general, the symptoms of these diseases are similar and in the beggining not much severe.",
              "People usually present clinical symptoms as fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.",
              "The delay in the manifestation of symptoms (about a week after contagion) combined with mild symptoms that affect the majority of the population are key ingredients that promote a fast spreading of the disease [49].",
              "In addition to these ingredients, the way as the virus is transmitted from one person to another also facilitates the spread.",
              "Transmission occurs through physical contact with contaminated people or surfaces, such as shaking hands or touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, mouth or nose, for example.",
              "Sneezing, coughing and saliva droplets from infected people also transmit the virus, that is why the use of masks and measures related to social distance are so required by health surveillance [80].",
              "In this context, mathematical modeling offers valuable tools for understanding the disease spreading, quantifying the total number of people being infected over time and, consequently, investigating the impact of humans mobility, environmental changes and also the effectiveness of prevention and control measures for developing and evaluating evidence for decision-making in global health [8, 30].",
              "The SIR model is one of the most basic models to investigate epidemic process.",
              "In this scenario, each individual can be in one of three epidemiological states at any given time: susceptible, infected and infectious, or removed which can mean immunized (recovered) or dead [45].",
              "The model specifies the rates at which individual changes their state, as detailed in the netx section.",
              "Originally, epidemic models did not taking into account the heterogeneity in contact behavior not even the mobility of the agents involved in the disease transmission process.",
              "The simplest theory of epidemic spreading assumes that the population can be divided into different compartments according to the stage of the disease as susceptible, infected or removed, for the SIR model, for example.",
              "However, individuals are assumed to be identical and have approximately the same number of neighbors.",
              "From this elementary approach, we are able to write a time evolution equation for the number of infected individuals and finally, we can obtain relevant informations about the disease spreading.",
              "This characterizes the homogenenous mean-field theory [7] and the complete analysis of this algebraic development is shown in Sect.",
              "4.",
              "Over the past few decades, the increase sophistication of epidemic models, the advance in the computational system and the use of complex network tools combine with big data provide opportunities to predict epidemic outbreaks and control strategies in an accurate and increasingly realistic way [8, 11, 40, 47].",
              "There are many works in the literature that can exemplify the advancement in mathematical modeling [3, 44].",
              "For instance, to model the measles outbreak in children, the models considered age groups, spatial and temporal features and metapopulation structured [24, 38, 82].",
              "Metapopulation is a set of populations, separated in space, but connected with each other allowing the movement of people between them [21].",
              "When it concerns about infectious diseases transmitted by a vector, such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika and leishmaniasis, the modeling involves at least two host species and environmental conditions should be considered.",
              "In this case, multilayer networks [37] have shown to be useful because they are composed by two distinc layers, for instance, one representing the human population and its mobility, and the other representing the same for the vector\u2014a mosquito, for example\u2014that transmits the disease to humans.",
              "The disease propagation between layers since one infected human can infect a insect which, in turn, can sting a healthy human and infects him [37].",
              "Novel emerging infections such as SARS, MERS, and SARS-Cov2 required models that take into account contact tracing, quarantine, human mobility patterns, intervetions measures, latency period, comorbidities, age groups and impact of vaccines.",
              "Besides that, social mixing patterns, the urban demography and spatial dynamics also have to be taken into account as they directly impact on the transmission of infectious diseases.",
              "[46, 51, 53].",
              "To implement and to investigate the spread of infectious diseases we can used a set of approaches: deterministic, stochastic, agent-based, or a mixed of them.",
              "These alternative perspectives allowing researchers to gain complementary insights about infectious diseases and investigate strategies for combating them.",
              "Most of them are based on compartment models, this means, the populations of individuals are divided in different compartments, where each compartment represents a specific stage of the disease [30].",
              "In a stochastic framework, the transition probabilities of one compartment to another can be modeled by a continuous time Markov process [1, 76].",
              "However, these probabilities can be approximated, in the deterministic approach, by a differential form.",
              "In this case, the set of ordinary differential equations describe how the system evolve in time [69, 74].",
              "Besides that, statistical approaches can also be used to model epidemic dynamics, mainly when it involves concerns related to the spatio-temporal behavior of the disease [6, 41, 66].",
              "In general, all of these models try to capture the complexity of the real-world such as mobility patterns, social contacts, age stratification and spatial distribution of the population.",
              "The deterministic investigation of epidemic models is already sufficient to provide us a basic description of an epidemic, such as the existence of an epidemic threshold that separates a phase where the epidemic grows exponentially from a disease-free state [54].",
              "It is due to the existence of this threshold that disease control measures can be introduced.",
              "On the other hand, stochastic models, associated with Monte Carlos simulations, are useful to investigate epidemic models on networks [4, 36, 62, 64].",
              "In this scenario, each individual of a population is represented by a vertex or a node of the network and the transmission of the disease occurs through edges connecting them.",
              "This framework provides a more realistic perspective, since we are able to investigate the epidemic spreading on large and highly heterogeneous systems. In the next section, we describe both deterministic and stochastic approaches to explore the SIR model.",
              "How to model the evolution of the dynamic disease and how to mitigate its growth?",
              "[45] An epidemic outbreak usually starts with just one infected person\u2014called zero individual\u2014that is the first one takes the virus.",
              "As mentioned previously, we can use the SIR model [45] to investigate this dynamic.",
              "The SIR model becomes a famous epidemic model because despite its simplicity, it is able to predict an essential feature for epidemiology: epidemic threshold.",
              "It separates two distinct states of the epidemic: disease free scenario and a state of there are a significant quantity of infected people [54].",
              "There are many other models more complex than the SIR model, but almost all of them are based on the SIR rules, that describes very well the dynamic of an epidemic [62].",

              "25, 28 During the course of the SARS epidemic in 2003, mathematical modelling was an essential tool in showing that intervention methods gradually brought the epidemic under control in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China and Singapore,7, 8, 25, 28 and that controls appear to have been lifted too early in Toronto, Canada.",
              "29 Reanalysis of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic shows that public health measures were effective in mitigating this outbreak.",
              "30, 31, 32 Although R is an estimate of average transmission at a population level, individuals vary both in how they respond to an outbreak of a novel infection (such SARS) or an outbreak of a known infection (such as pandemic influenza), and in their behaviour in terms of the number of contacts that they make.",
              "14 Some individuals, termed \u2018superspreaders\u2019, may transmit to many others either because of some characteristic of their infection, because of their contacts or purely by chance \u2013 being in the wrong place at the right stage of their infection.",
              "7, 8, 33, 34, Care should be taken when gathering and interpreting data on possible exposures because they may be subject to bias towards previously identified sources and away from transmission from casual contacts;",

              "In assessing the potential consequences of an infectious disease outbreak, one of the most important concerns of policy makers is the number of fatalities.",
              "The case fatality rate (CFR) for a particular aetiological agent is the proportion of those who acquire the disease who will eventually die from it.",
              "In the early stages of an outbreak there will be many new cases of the disease for whom the outcome is not yet known and therefore estimates of the CFR must be carefully calculated.",
              "6, 35 In 2003 the WHO initially reported a CFR of 5 per cent,4 in fact the CFR for SARS was a much higher 15 per cent overall.",
              "6, 35 The overall CFR often hides large variations, with the young and the elderly often at highest risk.",
              "In the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, the CFR was very low among the young (<1 per cent for ages <30 years) and increased to 55 per cent for patients over 60 years of age.",
              "15 Very few cases were admitted to hospital among the very young,6 which is unusual because children are often considered to be the group with the highest rate of transmission of directly transmitted pathogens, while also serving as a source of infection for their parents and other adults (sometimes called a \u2018core group\u2019).",
              "1 Serological surveys showed little evidence to support asymptomatic cases among this age group.",
              "In the influenza pandemic of 1918, the CFR was much higher (\u223c3 per cent) in young adults aged 20\u201340 years than in non-pandemic years (<0.",
              "5 per cent).",
              "36 Also, those aged 5\u201314 years contributed disproportionately to the numbers of cases (\u223c25 per cent), but not to the numbers of deaths.",
              "36 There could be many possible explanations for these distributions, such as previous exposure to the pandemic strain, environmental factors, patterns of mixing and transmission because of the world war,36 or because of biological factors which could have made the virus so pathogenic overall (such as those discussed by Loo et al37).",
              "High numbers of cases and fatalities among the 20\u201340 age group are likely to have huge economic impact because they form an important part of the workforce, and are primary carers for children.",
              "Isolation of symptomatic individuals together with tracing and quarantine of their contacts constitute major weapons in the armoury of public health outbreak control measures.",
              "The success of these strategies has been shown to be crucially dependent on the proportion of transmissions which occur before infected individuals show symptoms.26 Isolation of a proportion of symptomatic individuals can control an outbreak provided this proportion is large enough for that infection.",
              "26 Normally circulating influenza is believed to be infectious before the infected individual is showing symptoms,38 which makes control extremely difficult.",
              "If, however, the disease is mainly transmitted to close contacts, for example family members, then contact tracing may be manageable and effective.",
              "If transmission is likely for more casual contacts, contact tracing is much more difficult.",
              "Contact tracing has also been shown to depend on the degree of variability in the timing of infectiousness between different infected people in the population.",
              "39, 40 Before large amounts of resources are allocated, it may be important to assess the effectiveness of such a policy early in an epidemic through analysis of transmission chains and the impact of the intervention on the effective reproduction number.",
              "Both vaccination and prophylactic treatment with antiviral drugs or antibiotics restrict the spread of an infectious disease by limiting the number of individuals to whom the infection can be transmitted.",
              "Such strategies do not have to eliminate susceptibility from the population, but merely need to reduce the number of susceptible individuals so that the epidemic cannot be sustained.",
              "The minimum proportion of the population that must be vaccinated to prevent a large outbreak is 1\u22121/R0 for homogeneous populations.",
              "1 (There are also expressions for heterogeneous populations.",
              "41) This proportion is higher for diseases with large R0.",
              "The whole population need not be vaccinated, as those who are not vaccinated are protected by \u2018herd immunity\u2019, that is, the fact that the epidemic cannot be sustained in the population because there are so few susceptible individuals.",
              "Limited vaccine and antivirals stockpiles available to governments may be employed in a number of ways, to those most at risk, to key workers, or to contain an outbreak.",
              "If antivirals are to be distributed prophylactically to prevent the spread of disease, rather than to treat cases, then containment may be possible, provided (i) there are enough doses or courses of treatment, (ii) the programme is implemented extremely rapidly, and (iii) cases are situated in a limited geographic region.",
              "11, 13, 40 The evolution of drug resistance would, of course, be a concern if large scale prophylaxis were implemented.",
              "Because of the short doubling time of influenza epidemics, these strategies would have to be implemented when there are very few cases.",
              "One such responsive strategy \u2013 implementing travel restrictions and prophylactic treatment of everyone within 10 km ring of each case \u2013 would require a stockpile of approximately 3 million courses of antiviral drugs to contain an outbreak of pandemic influenza.",
              "11 Following the publication of this analysis by Ferguson et al, Roche donated 3 million doses of their antiviral drug to the WHO for this very purpose and the WHO has set up project to develop protocols for practical implementation of containment.",

              "42, 43, 44, 45 The SARS epidemic of 2003 spread across the globe within a matter of days, eventually affecting 27 countries, with suspected cases reported in every populated continent (Figure 1).",
              "Public health measures, including screening and travel restrictions, can be put in place to slow this spread.",
              "The effectiveness of such methods, however, is dependent on the characteristics of the disease.",
              "If an infection has an incubation period which is longer than the duration of a flight then infected people are unlikely to develop symptoms during a flight.",
              "Thus even 100 per cent effective entry screening is unlikely to be useful in identifying cases.",
              "45 Imported SARS cases caused new outbreaks only in the early stages of the global outbreak, because of effective exchanges of information about the disease, the lack of pre-symptomatic infectiousness, and local outbreak control.",
              "If an outbreak is uncontrolled, then the number of new cases continues to grow exponentially and sheer weight of numbers means that cases will be exported.",

              "These data are increasingly digitized and critical for the development of new health interventions, in particular those that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve health outcomes (1, 2).",
              "Recognizing that pooling and sharing data can accelerate innovation, there have been several calls in recent years to make data available as a global public good for health as part of a set of collective actions that are global in scope and required to address transnational health challenges (3, 4).",
              "Most recently, researchers and global policy makers have called for data sharing related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and developed platforms to facilitate the sharing of patient-level data for those who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 (5, 6).",
              "The pandemic has underscored the urgent need to recognize health data as a global public good with mechanisms to facilitate rapid data sharing and data governance.",
              "Doing so would support critical pandemic response activities.",
              "For example, researchers in China sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome and made the data publicly available through an open access platform in January 2020 (7).",
              "By making these data available, these researchers helped hasten the development of critical diagnostic assays.",
              "Despite these efforts, there remain several persistent challenges that will need to be overcome.",
              "The technical challenges associated with data sharing have increased as datasets have grown in size and become more complex (8).",
              "There also remain several economic, legal, and political barriers that make sharing health-related data difficult.",
              "In the context of appeals for increased data sharing related to health and efforts to overcome these multifaceted challenges, different types of data and their sources are often conflated.",
              "This is problematic because the mechanisms to facilitate data sharing are often specific to data types.",
              "For example, data sharing platforms for clinical data remain in the nascent phase.",
              "While in some areas, such as cardiovascular disease, there are efforts emerging to address both drug development and clinical practice (9), in others, like genomics, where data sharing platforms are more established, the analytical software and associated outputs require significant effort for conversion and standardization (10).",
              "Given these unique and data-specific challenges and toward establishing data as a global public good, we conducted a rapid review to characterize the current barriers to sharing data that are specific to the types of data used in public health efforts and to identify potential solutions that would support data sharing in the context of these challenges.",
              "The findings of this review could help in prioritizing the types of data that would benefit global public health and pandemic preparedness efforts through improved and expanded sharing (Table 1).",
              "Data domains, owners, and examples of data (11).",
              "As the volume of public health data expands and data are more interconnected, a broad range of data is being used to support research and inform global health policies and practice.",
              "We expand on an existing framework (21) to provide a classification of data into four broad archetypes (1) patient data, (2) health systems data, (3) routine public health data, and (4) health research data.",
              "It should be noted that this categorization is used to describe how these data are generated and not necessarily their application or use.",
              "This data classification is also described in further detail in Table 1.",
              "Data generated at the patient level include biomedical data (e.",
              "g., genomic data, proteomic data), electronic health records, and data generated by individuals themselves (e.",
              "g., data from wearables and social media).",
              "Sharing patient data allows for independent analysis of research results to ensure reliability, reproducibility, and accountability\u2014all increasingly important in the context of black box algorithms based on AI.",
              "Sharing datasets can provide researchers and health intervention developers with appropriate population data references.",
              "Data sharing can therefore make an important contribution to public health by strengthening the evidence base used to make clinical and regulatory decisions (22).",
              "Health systems data include human resources data, service availability and utilization data (e.",
              "g., number of hospital beds, insurance claims data), and performance metrics (e.",
              "g., performance assessment results, patient satisfaction surveys).",
              "Many of these data are found in health management information systems (HMIS) datasets used around the world, including in many resource limited settings.",
              "Sharing health systems data can strengthen coordination and collaboration between the public and private sectors toward achieving common public health goals and outcomes.",
              "Sharing health systems data with the research community can also provide insights into strategies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of health services and measuring the impact of new health policies and interventions.",
              "Routine sources include health facility and community information systems. Non-routine sources are household and other population-based surveys (e.",
              "g., demographic and health surveys, multi-indicator cluster surveys), censuses, civil registration (e.",
              "g., births and deaths) and vital statistics systems, disease surveillance systems, health facility surveys, and administrative data systems (23).",
              "Many of these data are already made available publicly either in aggregate or at the individual level.",
              "In addition to supporting research activities as already described, sharing routine and non-routine public health data can also serve to establish global health guidelines, norms, and standards.",
              "In particular, these data can be used to provide more comprehensive estimates of morbidity and mortality, including cause-specific estimates.",
              "The data described above are largely collected for administrative purposes or for program planning and management purposes.",
              "However, a large volume of data are generated through observational and experimental health research efforts.",
              "Sharing clinical trial data can accelerate advances in public health by generating evidence on the safety and effectiveness of interventions.",
              "There are numerous examples of data from clinical trials being used to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of interventions or to improve clinical care (24).",
              "Making such data available supports transparency and reproducibility in research.",
              "The barriers to sharing health data have been well-characterized by Van Panhuis et al.",
              "(25) Based on our rapid review, we expanded on this nomenclature to identify the barriers specific to data sharing in global public health, and have illustrated in the table below how they might apply to each archetype.",
              "Data protection regulations vary across jurisdictions so definitions on ownership, control and use, as well as the tools or applications that apply these definitions need to align with applicable regulation in relevant jurisdictions (26).",
              "For transparency, when users create or generate data on a web or mobile application, the application's information collection and sharing policies are often unclear to the user.",
              "This creates a lack of transparency regarding how information may flow beyond its initial or intended audience or purpose (27).",
              "Informed consent is also problematic to implement.",
              "Collection, sharing and use of data can take place without individuals understanding it is happening or the extent that it does.",
              "This means there is a need to ensure a clear understanding on when its being collected, what is collected, how it will be shared and used, as well as how consent can be revoked (28).",
              "Security is another major barrier.",
              "Data breaches can expose confidential information, lead to third-party manipulation and violate rights or dignity.",
              "Data protection standards are needed to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure or use of personal data (29).",
              "Security is closely linked to rights and stigma, and the need to protect against the use of information to exploit, marginalize, criminalize, discriminate or exclude vulnerable or disproportionately affected populations (30).",
              "For all data archetypes, the prospect of sharing data raises concerns related to threats to the privacy of personal information that can identify or be linked to a person (31, 32).",
              "Privacy issues are particularly acute with regard to patient data, including in resource-constrained settings where data systems are rapidly evolving, corruption is common, and data managers might lack sufficient security training (33\u201335).",
              "In such settings, regulations may be lacking or not be enforced (34).",
              "Even when consent procedures are in place, patients are not always explained the extent to which their data are being shared, with whom, or for what purpose (34).",
              "The use of mobile tracking apps to assist with contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted many of these concerns, with multiple examples of data being sold to private companies without individual consent (11, 36, 37).",
              "Given these considerations, efforts related to data sharing in global health should require patient data and research data to be fully anonymized.",
              "To date in public health, with perhaps some notable exceptions [i.",
              "e., research (38) and \u201comics\u201d], there are few efforts focused on health data sharing across borders.",
              "Rather, existing data sharing activities seem to focus primarily on individual country standardization and interoperability (39).",
              "Also, where they exist, data sharing frameworks, laws, and regulations have not kept pace with the technological advances that are changing how data collection, sharing, and analysis occur (27, 30).",
              "While many of these issues are not unique to global public health, there is perhaps particular urgency in this area given the self- or group-identifying characteristics of data and the potential for misuse or harm if in the wrong hands or without proper safeguards.",
              "Addressing these pitfalls, including the misuse of public health data, will require a range of interventions bespoke to the respective data archetype and that takes into account the motivations and incentives of data owners.",
              "It will also require countries and data owners to commit to data sharing principles and acknowledge data as a global public good (4, 40).",
              "Toward this end, there are lessons that can be learned from other disciplines where data sharing and standardization efforts are more advanced.",
              "The most well-know is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which has supported the development of over 23 thousand standards in a diverse range of areas, covering almost every aspect of technology and manufacturing.",
              "Less well-known is the World Meteorological Organization, which hosts a data exchange and technology transfer platform through which national weather agencies regularly share large atmospheric and meteorological data (41).",
              "The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is an international cooperative based in Belgium that enables secure and standardized financial transactions around the world.",

              "also known as SWIFT BIC and SWIFT codes) is a unique identification code that is used to facilitate the reliable transfer of funds between banks.",
              "In its role as the normative global health agency, we believe that the World Health Organization (WHO) could also play an active role in coordinating data sharing efforts, engaging in partnerships and in the development of guidelines and standards, in particular for patient data, public health data, and health systems data.",
              "There are multiple examples where such efforts are already underway.",
              "WHO has developed a number of policies on data sharing (42).",
              "While legally binding, these policies do provide direction for member states (43, 44).",
              "Another is EPI-BRAIN (Epidemic Big Data Resource and Analytics Innovation Network) (45), an online platform intended to bring together public health data with information such as population movement, animal diseases meteorological, and other environmental factors to allow for analysis of large scale data sets for outbreak prediction and emergency preparedness.",
              "WHO has also recently established a new platform to support clinical characterization of patients with COVID-19 (46).",

              "While these efforts are not necessarily aggregated across countries, the architecture of the software makes this a possibility (18).",
              "While engaging WHO does not imply compliance, by focusing on norms, standards, and guidance, including issues related to privacy, data standardization, and interoperability, WHO can serve to advance data sharing efforts for the benefit of global health.",

              "45 76 81 86 A major concern cited was the lack of guidance for defining the term \u2018global\u2019 in GH.",
              "26 34 43 48 75 As Bozorgmehr has outlined, the term is often used interchangeably within the GH community to mean \u2018worldwide\u2019, \u2018everywhere\u2019, \u2018holistic\u2019 and/or \u2018issues that transcend national boundaries\u2019.",
              "48 This trend was noticeable within our review, as well.",
              "Engebretsen emphasised that GH \u2018does not only allude to supranational dependency within the health field, but refers to a norm or vision for health with global ambitions\u2019.",
              "26 This view suggests that because the planet is populated by a multiplicity of positionings, perspectives and diverse world views, there can never be a truly a universal definition of \u2018the global\u2019 nor a global consensus around the definition of GH.",
              "Finally, among studies that conducted original research into the definition of GH, several reported that study participants could not reach consensus on a definition.",
              "52 74 75 77 Many thought it would be difficult if not impossible to arrive at a single, unified theoretical definition of GH, yet considered it important to formulate an operational definition of GH for guiding emerging activities related to GH.",
              "23 45 77 This is the first study to systematically synthesise the literature defining GH and analyse the definitions found therein.",
              "All of the articles included in this study were published in peer-reviewed journals since 2009 indicating recent and steadfast interest in the topic of GH\u2019s definition.",
              "This review examined GH definitions in the literature, and our thematic analysis focused on identifying recurrent themes across different definitions of GH.",
              "Of the 78 articles included in this study, approximately one-third utilised empirical research methodologies to posit definitions of GH or else directly contribute towards the establishment of a common definition.",
              "Another one-third of papers summarised and discussed previously published definitions of GH (eg, reviews/overviews), while the remaining one-third suggested definitions of GH that were less grounded in analysis of empirical data than in the perspectives of its authors (eg, editorials, viewpoints).",
              "This systematic analysis indicated that the question of GH\u2019s precise definition marks a point of controversy across fields of expertise.",
              "The variety of GH definitions posited by diverse experts in search of a common definition indicate that GH is multifaceted and polysemous.",
              "In its broadest sense, GH can be defined as an area of research and practice committed to the application of overtly multidisciplinary, multisectoral and culturally sensitive approaches for reducing health disparities that transcend national borders.",
              "Indeed, it was most commonly defined across the literature in such general terms. More specific definitions of GH were, of course, proposed by and considered valuable for many stakeholders in our review.",
              "Our analysis indicates that the precise definitions proposed by different experts were devised to serve particular functions.",
              "For example, narrow and concise definitions of GH were most frequently sought in the domains of governance and education, primarily for steering the development of policy frameworks and curricula, respectively.",
              "The imperative for an exact definition of GH in these subfields may be linked to bureaucratic demands for demarcating a technical term under which to classify specific activities, standardise certain functions, administer funds and direct workflow accordingly.",
              "It is also in this domain that authors most vociferously decried the absence of a unified and concise definition of GH, arguing this lack has led to ineffective initiatives, elusive methods for establishing accountability and instances of resource allocation based on ad hoc criteria\u2014attractiveness to donors, public opinion, development agendum, foreign, economic or security policy priorities and so on\u2014rather than via transparent mechanisms for adjudicating health need.",
              "28 54 58 65 83 In contexts where health needs and upstream challenges were articulated, the lack of an agreed-upon definition oft impeded the policy process because stakeholders could not discern which GH issues among the multitude of different problems labelled as important were, in fact, the most pressing.",
              "24 45 52 Because political indecision ramifies disproportionately for publics in countries where reliance on GH aid is a matter of life and death, establishing a clear definition of GH seems most crucial for the domain of governance.",
              "We also found that detailed descriptions of GH\u2019s specific conceptual and functional dimensions tended to reflect the specialisations or discipline-specific priorities of their authors.",
              "For example, definitions of GH stipulating the primacy of \u2018cultural competency\u2019 and \u2018multidisciplinarity\u2019 were more commonly proposed by interdisciplinary professionals in the literature on GH education than in journals of health policy, where definitions of GH were oriented more toward \u2018security\u2019 and \u2018governance\u2019 concerns.",
              "This suggests a correspondence between the subjective, experiential positions of the definers and the vocabulary they used to define or frame the need to define GH.",
              "Unsurprisingly, we found that health professionals proposed the majority of definitions of GH in the literature.",
              "Additionally, the majority of publications and their authors were from higher income countries.",
              "Several authors in our review critically observed that GH has become institutionalised at a faster rate in higher income countries compared with lower and middle-income countries.",
              "20 48 63 72 77 82 Their observations combined with our findings suggest that extant definitions of GH published in the literature or otherwise circulating in academic and professionalised spaces may unevenly reflect the interests and priorities of stakeholders from higher income countries.",
              "This suggests a need for greater diversity and inclusion in the debate on GH\u2019s definition, as well as further reflexivity regarding who is defining GH, their means and motivations for doing so, and what these definitions put into action.",
              "Interestingly, several articles published since 2019 have extended the debate on this topic of GH\u2019s definition by directly engaging questions of geography and positionality: a recent commentary by King and Kolski defining GH \u2018as public health somewhere else\u2019 was met with pushback by those who argue that spatial definitions of GH are limited and limiting.",
              "99\u2013102 To determine how GH is defined by experts in the literature, we ensured that the selection criteria developed for this study were broad enough to include a wide range of perspectives.",
              "Therefore, we included articles with varying degrees of evidentiary support, such as viewpoints, commentaries and editorials.",
              "Consequently, the results may be influenced by some of the primary researchers\u2019 assumptions, projections, and biases.",
              "Backward citation tracking was used to add relevant articles to the review that had not been initially identified through database searching.",
              "This ensured that the review was exhaustive, however it also means that some conclusions drawn in the thematic analysis may have been influenced by this manual search strategy.",
              "By applying qualitative methods, this review provided a robust analysis of the thematic categories undergirding extant definitions of GH.",
              "A major limitation of this form of analysis is the extensive time required to develop and establish a code book and standardise the three coders\u2019 use of the code book.",
              "However, this was deemed necessary to ensure consistency of judgement and intercoder reliability at each stage in the analysis.",
              "Another limitation of this study is that only articles written in English were included.",
              "To enhance the generalisability of results, future reviews should include data from non-English articles, especially if an inclusive, common definition of GH is to be achieved.",
              "Finally, this review was finalised prior to the emergence of the novel coronavirus.",
              "As such, future research should take into account new definitions of GH that emerge in light of the pandemic and lessons learnt.",
              "Between 2009 and 2019, GH was most commonly defined in the literature in broad and general terms: as an area of research and practice committed to the application of multidisciplinary, multisectoral and culturally sensitive approaches for reducing health disparities that transcend national borders.",
              "More precise definitions exist to serve particular functions and tend to reflect the priorities of its definers.",
              "The four key themes that emerged from the present analysis are that GH is: (1) a multiplex approach to worldwide health improvement taught and researched through academic institutions;",
              "(2) an ethos that is guided by justice principles;",
              "(3) a mode of governance that yields influence through political decision-making, problem identification, the allocation and exchange of resources across borders and (4) a polysemous concept with historical antecedents and an emergent future.",
              "Findings from this thematic analysis have the potential to organise future conversations about which definition of GH is most common and/or most useful.",
              "Future discussions on the topic might shift from questioning the abstract \u2018what\u2019 of GH to more pragmatic and reflexive questions about \u2018who\u2019 defines GH and towards what ends.",

              "Vaccines help the body learn how to defend itself from disease without the dangers of a full-blown infection.",
              "The immune response to a vaccine might cause tiredness and discomfort for a day or two, but the resulting protection can last a lifetime.",
              "Infections are unpredictable and can have long-term consequences.",
              "Even mild or symptom-less infections can be deadly.",
              "For example, most people infected with the human papillomavirus (HPV) never show any sign of infection.",
              "But for some, the sign appears years later as an aggressive, life-threatening cancer.",
              "By then, it\u2019s too late to get vaccinated.",
              "Vaccines work by imitating an infection\u2014the presence of a disease-causing organism in the body\u2014to engage the body\u2019s natural defenses.",
              "The active ingredient in all vaccines is an antigen, the name for any substance that causes the immune system to begin producing antibodies.",
              "In a vaccine, the antigen could be either Antibodies are proteins produced by white blood cells to identify and neutralize foreign substances.",
              "White blood cells are created in the bone marrow but dispersed throughout the body in low numbers, ready to begin multiplying and attacking microbes and substances not native to the body.",
              "After they have eliminated an infection, white blood cells stop multiplying and their numbers dwindle until only a few are left to keep watch.",
              "At that point, a person is considered immunized.",
              "Because immunity can take weeks to develop after vaccination, it is possible to become infected in the weeks immediately following vaccination.",
              "Even after that, vaccinated people can and sometimes do get infected.",
              "But a vaccinated person is far less likely to die or become seriously ill than someone whose immune system is unprepared to fight an infection.",
              "A single dose of vaccine provides only partial protection.",
              "The number of doses needed to achieve immunity depends on whether the antigen in a vaccine is alive or not.",
              "Because they contain living bacteria or viruses, live-attenuated vaccines can provide enduring protection with only two doses.",
              "By contrast, non-live vaccines typically require at least three doses to achieve protection that fades over time and must be restored with booster doses.",
              "Live-attenuated vaccines Non-live vaccines Certain vaccines must be updated periodically to protect against mutation-prone viruses that cause waves of infections months or years apart.",
              "To stay protected, people must get the updated vaccines even if they got an earlier version.",
              "History shows that vaccines are the safest, most effective way to protect yourself and your family from many preventable diseases.",
              "Everyone should get all recommended vaccines at the recommended times.",

              "Adults should get all recommended vaccines for their age or other risk factors such as health condition or occupation.",
              "All adults should get tetanus boosters, seasonal flu and COVID-19 vaccines, and any vaccines missed in childhood.",
              "To be immune is to be partially or fully resistant to a specific infectious disease or disease-causing organism.",
              "A person who is immune can resist the bacteria or viruses that cause a disease, but the protection is never perfect.",
              "Immunization is the process of being made resistant to an infectious disease, usually by means of a vaccine.",
              "Immunity is protection against a disease, and it can be passive or active, natural or vaccine induced.",
              "Active immunity comes from being exposed to a disease-causing organism.",
              "Either way, active immunity takes longer to develop but lasts longer than passive immunity.",

              "When a pathogen does infect the body, our body\u2019s defences, called the immune system, are triggered and the pathogen is attacked and destroyed or overcome.",
              "A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that can cause disease within the body.",
              "Each pathogen is made up of several subparts, usually unique to that specific pathogen and the disease it causes.",
              "The subpart of a pathogen that causes the formation of antibodies is called an antigen.",
              "The antibodies produced in response to the pathogen\u2019s antigen are an important part of the immune system.",
              "You can consider antibodies as the soldiers in your body\u2019s defense system.",
              "Each antibody, or soldier, in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen.",
              "We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies.",
              "When the human body is exposed to an antigen for the first time, it takes time for the immune system to respond and produce antibodies specific to that antigen.",
              "In the meantime, the person is susceptible to becoming ill.",
              "Once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced, they work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease.",
              "Antibodies to one pathogen generally don\u2019t protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other, like cousins.",
              "Once the body produces antibodies in its primary response to an antigen, it also creates antibody-producing memory cells, which remain alive even after the pathogen is defeated by the antibodies.",
              "If the body is exposed to the same pathogen more than once, the antibody response is much faster and more effective than the first time around because the memory cells are at the ready to pump out antibodies against that antigen.",
              "This means that if the person is exposed to the dangerous pathogen in the future, their immune system will be able to respond immediately, protecting against disease.",
              "Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body.",
              "Newer vaccines contain the blueprint for producing antigens rather than the antigen itself.",
              "Regardless of whether the vaccine is made up of the antigen itself or the blueprint so that the body will produce the antigen, this weakened version will not cause the disease in the person receiving the vaccine, but it will prompt their immune system to respond much as it would have on its first reaction to the actual pathogen.",
              "Some vaccines require multiple doses, given weeks or months apart.",
              "This is sometimes needed to allow for the production of long-lived antibodies and development of memory cells.",
              "In this way, the body is trained to fight the specific disease-causing organism, building up memory of the pathogen so as to rapidly fight it if and when exposed in the future.",
              "When someone is vaccinated, they are very likely to be protected against the targeted disease.",
              "But not everyone can be vaccinated.",
              "People with underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems (such as cancer or HIV) or who have severe allergies to some vaccine components may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines.",
              "These people can still be protected if they live in and amongst others who are vaccinated.",
              "When a lot of people in a community are vaccinated the pathogen has a hard time circulating because most of the people it encounters are immune.",
              "So the more that others are vaccinated, the less likely people who are unable to be protected by vaccines are at risk of even being exposed to the harmful pathogens.",
              "This is called herd immunity.",
              "This is especially important for those people who not only can\u2019t be vaccinated but may be more susceptible to the diseases we vaccinate against.",
              "No single vaccine provides 100% protection, and herd immunity does not provide full protection to those who cannot safely be vaccinated.",
              "But with herd immunity, these people will have substantial protection, thanks to those around them being vaccinated.",
              "Vaccinating not only protects yourself, but also protects those in the community who are unable to be vaccinated.",
              "If you are able to, get vaccinated.",
              "Throughout history, humans have successfully developed vaccines for a number of life-threatening diseases, including meningitis, tetanus, measles and wild poliovirus.",
              "In the early 1900s, polio was a worldwide disease, paralysing hundreds of thousands of people every year.",

              "The World Health Organization estimates that global vaccination programs save 2\u20133 million lives per year by priming the immune system to protect against pathogenic threats that pose significant global health and economic burdens1.",
              "Besides individual protection, vaccination programs also rely on population or \u201cherd\u201d immunity: the immunization of large portions of the population to protect the unvaccinated, immunocompromised, and immunologically nai\u0308ve by reducing the number of susceptible hosts to a level below the threshold needed for transmission.",
              "For example, immunization of >80% of the global population against smallpox virus reduced transmission rates to uninfected individuals to a point low enough to achieve eradication of the virus2.",
              "Similarly, poliovirus is now targeted for eradication, with only Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria documenting endemic viral infections1.",
              "Despite the success of select vaccination programs, societal and biological factors (Figure 1), including the inability of population groups to generate protective immunity in response to vaccination is a challenge for achieving herd immunity.",
              "The unvaccinated, including the very young, aged, and those who are immunocompromised due to infection, congenital conditions or medical history, must be protected by passive immunity.",
              "For example, unvaccinated females benefit from human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of their male partners3,4, as HPV strains 16 and 18 are linked to 70\u201380% of cases of cervical cancer4.",
              "While both males and females can be infected with HPV, females are more likely to experience detrimental oncogenic effects, including loss of reproductive capabilities.",
              "The vaccination of females and males in young populations with attenuated vaccines of the circulating HPV strains (6, 11, 16, and 18) has decreased transmission of these specific HPV viruses to young unvaccinated females in Scotland3.",
              "Thus, vaccination of the potential carriers within the population can promote disease prevention in the unvaccinated.",
              "Biological and societal factors affecting vaccine-induced population immunity.",
              "Immune senescence, immaturity, and imprinting limit human vaccine responses.",
              "These issues pose challenging obstacles to the development of vaccine-induced broadly protective long-lasting immunity.",
              "Immunosenescence refers to the progressive loss of responsiveness to a pathogen, resulting in decreased antibody titer or cellular responses, requiring booster vaccinations to restore immunity.",
              "In the late 20th century, measles was nearly eradicated in China, Korea and the United States as the result of early-age vaccination and boosters with attenuated virus5,6.",
              "However, re-introduction of the wild-type virus into these localities has caused spikes of infection in immunized middle-aged adults and has been linked to the wild-type measles virus\u2019 capacity to overcome reduced antibody titers in these more aged populations5,6, indicating a prospective need for a tertiary booster in adults to bolster neutralization titers.",
              "The breadth and length of duration of herd immunity are also dependent upon characteristics of the pathogen and its interactions with the immune system.",
              "Antigenic drift, antigenic shift, and recombination result in antigenic diversity within a pathogen pool, and a viral species can consist of multiple variants that are antigenically distinct from each other.",
              "The lack of a proof-reading function associated with most RNA polymerases makes RNA viruses particularly adept at generating strain diversity.",

              "The immunocompromised, immunosenescent, and young children have been postulated to be norovirus reservoirs7.",
              "In these populations, a suppressed or nai\u0308ve immune system may not fully neutralize every viral variant.",
              "Lower immune pressure on the virus, along with an error-prone RNA polymerase, allows for mutated variants to emerge and escape neutralization.",
              "Pathogen-immune response interactions also shape Dengue and influenza virus immunity and subsequent vaccine design.",
              "Dengue circulates as four serotypes, (DENV1\u20134), which have roughly 70% sequence homology.",
              "Infection with one serotype induces production of both cross-reactive and serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies during initial infection8.",
              "Upon infection with a second serotype, the original memory immune response is preferentially stimulated.",
              "Due to antigenic differences between the primary and secondary viruses, pre-existing antibody is unable to effectively neutralize the second virus, allowing immune evasion through immune imprinting (original antigenic sin/antigenic seniority)8,9.",
              "Importantly, depending on the level and neutralization capacity of the cross-reactive pre-existing antibodies, a secondary infection can cause severe disease10.",
              "Similarly, the immune system preferentially recalls memory antibody responses to the earliest infecting strains of influenza A and norovirus and shows weaker consecutive responses to infection with subsequent serotypes, respectively 11,13.",
              "As the herd is composed of individuals from many different age groups, and pandemic Influenza and norovirus strains change over time, effective vaccine development that induces broad protection is highly complicated by age and pre-exposure history.",
              "Conserved epitopes are potential vaccine targets for these and other pathogens that are susceptible to antigenic drift/shift and recombination7.",
              "While progress toward a universal influenza vaccine is being made, protection currently relies on regular vaccination with multiple attenuated circulating strains to reduce transmission and mitigate disease severity11.",
              "Despite a global surveillance network, predicting future flu epidemic strains for vaccine production is high risk, as evidence by influenza vaccine-contemporary strain mismatches in both 2014\u20132015 and 2017\u20132018 14.",
              "Norovirus, dengue, and influenza illustrate challenges in eliciting broad immunity through vaccination with a single serotype of attenuated virus.",
              "While vaccination would protect against the vaccinated serotype, it has the potential to increase the severity of a secondary infection by inducing a dampened response to later variants based on antigenic variation, imprinting, and timing between inoculation and secondary infection and/or immune enhancement which occurs in Dengue virus secondary infections.",
              "Research focusing on protective immunity correlates, particularly cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers, and chimeric serotype attenuated-viruses to elicit broad immunity is underway7,8.",
              "Understanding and optimizing these factors may induce broad immunity across populations.",
              "As vaccines that can overcome the challenges of poor immune responsiveness in hosts and antigenic diversity in pathogens are developed, public policy plays a critical role in achieving the high population vaccination rate needed to achieve herd immunity and freedom from disease.",
              "Universal access to affordable health care is of the highest priority, as individuals of lower socioeconomic status often forgo vaccinations due to accessibility reasons12, which can leave large pockets of non-vaccinated, susceptible people who not only may suffer disease themselves but can also facilitate transmission to others who are unable to get immunized, thus breaking the protective barrier herd immunity provides.",
              "The observed spike in incidents of pertussis and measles in children and adults in the United States15, indicates a need for effective public education to counter anti-vaccination proponents whose fear of vaccine side-effects form pockets of susceptibility and opportunity for spread of pathogens among those who are immunocompromised or unable to receive a vaccine due to age requirements.",
              "The more accessible we make vaccination through education programs, minute clinics, job-site resources, and lowered costs, the more effective vaccination programs will be12.",
              "To reach the goal of protection from disease and eradication of pathogens through vaccination, governments, scientists, and citizens will have to commit resources equivalent to the diversity and abundance of the pathogens we fight.",

              "Aedes albopictus mosquitoes have been responsible for outbreaks of human infections (including dengue and chikungunya) where humans are the main source of blood available.",
              "The capacity of Aedes albopictus to feed on many different species also means that they can potentially serve as bridge vectors and carry viruses from one species to another, for example, from animals to humans.",

              "Viruses are also heterogeneous.",

              "Mosquitoes are refractory to infection by many viruses.",
              "A virus must overcome multiple barriers to be transmitted by a mosquito.",
              "The virus must infect the epithelial cells of the mosquito midgut.",
              "To do this, it must overcome the digestive enzymes in the mosquito, internal microbiota, and the physical barrier of the midgut epithelium.",
              "The virus must infect, replicate, be shed and then cross the basal lamina into the hemolymph of the mosquito.",
              "To be transmitted, the virus must traverse the basal lamina surrounding the salivary gland and infect acinar cells.",
              "From that site, virus can be inoculated into hosts at the time of blood feeding.",
              "If the salivary glands are infected, the virus persists in saliva for the life of the mosquito \u2013 allowing the mosquito to transmit the virus to more than one host.",
              "A virus may infect the midgut but be unable to disseminate or unable to infect the salivary glands.",
              "In the laboratory, mosquitoes can be allowed to feed on blood containing viruses and can then be tested at various points in time to assess presence of virus at various sites and its presence in mosquito saliva.",
              "As an interesting aside, the YF vaccine virus (which has been used since 1937) apparently is able to infect mosquitoes but because of the midgut barrier is unable to disseminate in mosquitoes \u2013 so it cannot be transmitted by mosquitoes from person to person even though the vaccine virus produces viremia in those vaccinated [11].",
              "It is relevant to know whether a specific vector population is competent to transmit a specific virus.",
              "It is even more useful to know the vector efficiency or vectorial capacity.",
              "Just because a particular mosquito is competent to transmit a specific virus, does not mean that it can do so efficiently.",
              "But even a mosquito that is a relatively inefficient vector, if present in large numbers may be able to sustain an outbreak.",
              "Vectorial capacity takes into account the number of mosquitoes relative to the host, the daily blood-feeding rate on the specific host (animal or human), the vector competence (the transmission rate among virus-exposed mosquitoes), the daily survival of the mosquito species or population being studied, and the external incubation period (time it takes for mosquito to transmit virus after initial exposure).",
              "Thus the vectorial capacity takes into account environmental as well mosquito factors that affect mosquito behavior, longevity, and biting activity.",
              "Predicting where YF outbreaks might occur is important in planning how to use vaccine but is complicated.",
              "To better understand potential for introductions of YF virus into new areas, many laboratory studies have been done to assess specific mosquito populations and their competence to transmit specific YF viruses.",
              "Amraoui [13] and colleagues at the Pasteur institute showed that Aedes albopictus mosquitoes collected from southeast France could be infected in the laboratory with a West African strain of YF virus.",

              "While people who are vaccinated can still get sick, they are better able to avoid serious outcomes than people who have not been vaccinated.",
              "CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a seasonal flu vaccine each year.",
              "With flu activity low but increasing, now is still a good time to get vaccinated.",
              "Data for this study were collected in the VISION Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) Network, a research collaboration between CDC, Westat, and multiple sites with integrated clinical, laboratory, and vaccination records in the United States.",

              "The 2022-2023 flu season saw the highest rates of flu-related hospitalizations in children since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",
              "Flu vaccine coverage among children last season was about 6 percentage points lower than it was prior to the pandemic.",
              "Higher hospitalization rates could reflect drops in vaccine coverage, but also the fact that last year the flu season began unusually early, and many kids who got sick had not yet had a chance to get vaccinated.",
              "Strong vaccine recommendations from clinicians and healthcare providers can help parents make the decision to get their children a flu vaccine.",

              "Children of any age with certain chronic health conditions are also at higher risk.",
              "During the 2022-2023 flu season, 66 percent of children (people younger than 18 years) who were hospitalized with flu in one of CDC\u2019s surveillance networks had at least one underlying health condition, such as asthma, neurologic disease, obesity, or a weakened immune system.",

              "A flu vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness by 40% to 60%, but even if your child still gets sick with flu, getting a flu vaccine can reduce illness severity, helping to prevent more serious flu-related outcomes.",

              "Most of the supervised ML algorithms can work with small datasets that are organized and labeled, whereas deep-learning programs can work with raw, unstructured data and require much larger volumes [60,61].",

              "After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, several efforts have been made to apply AI techniques on data such as CT scans, X-ray images, and cough sounds to follow infection [65,66,67].",
              "Several studies have utilized omics data to find repurposed drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment [68,69].",

              "IDVI scores range from 0 to 1, and a lower score signifies potential epidemic threats.",
              "Further, travel history along with common signs and symptoms through mobile phone-based online surveys can be used to build an AI-based model to predict risk factors [81].",
