That's a long dive down!\n- The largest ocean on Earth is the **Pacific Ocean**[^1^], which covers around 30 percent of the Earth's surface[^1^].

              "The melt rises as magma at the linear weakness between the separating plates, and emerges as lava, creating new oceanic crust and lithosphere upon cooling.",
              "The first discovered mid-ocean ridge was the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is a spreading center that bisects the North and South Atlantic basins;",
              "hence the origin of the name 'mid-ocean ridge'.",

              "Mid-ocean ridges around the globe are linked by plate tectonic boundaries and the trace of the ridges across the ocean floor appears similar to the seam of a baseball.",
              "The mid-ocean ridge system thus is the longest mountain range on Earth, reaching about 65,000 km (40,000 mi).",
              "The mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form the Ocean Ridge, a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean, making it the longest mountain range in the world.",
              "The continuous mountain range is 65,000 km (40,400 mi) long (several times longer than the Andes, the longest continental mountain range), and the total length of the oceanic ridge system is 80,000 km (49,700 mi) long.",
              "[1] At the spreading center on a mid-ocean ridge, the depth of the seafloor is approximately 2,600 meters (8,500 ft).",
              "[2][3] On the ridge flanks, the depth of the seafloor (or the height of a location on a mid-ocean ridge above a base-level) is correlated with its age (age of the lithosphere where depth is measured).",
              "The depth-age relation can be modeled by the cooling of a lithosphere plate[4][5] or mantle half-space.",
              "[6] A good approximation is that the depth of the seafloor at a location on a spreading mid-ocean ridge is proportional to the square root of the age of the seafloor.",
              "[6] The overall shape of ridges results from Pratt isostacy: close to the ridge axis, there is a hot, low-density mantle supporting the oceanic crust.",
              "As the oceanic plate cools, away from the ridge axis, the oceanic mantle lithosphere (the colder, denser part of the mantle that, together with the crust, comprises the oceanic plates) thickens, and the density increases.",
              "Thus older seafloor is underlain by denser material and is deeper.",
              "[4][5] Spreading rate is the rate at which an ocean basin widens due to seafloor spreading.",

              "[2][3][7][8] Spreading rates range from approximately 10\u2013200 mm/yr.",
              "[2][3] Slow-spreading ridges such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have spread much less far (showing a steeper profile) than faster ridges such as the East Pacific Rise (gentle profile) for the same amount of time and cooling and consequent bathymetric deepening.",
              "[2] Slow-spreading ridges (less than 40 mm/yr) generally have large rift valleys, sometimes as wide as 10\u201320 km (6.",

              "The crust and the relatively rigid peridotite below it make up the oceanic lithosphere, which sits above the less rigid and viscous asthenosphere.",
              "[3] The oceanic lithosphere is formed at an oceanic ridge, while the lithosphere is subducted back into the asthenosphere at ocean trenches.",
              "Two processes, ridge-push and slab pull, are thought to be responsible for spreading at mid-ocean ridges.",
              "[24] Ridge push refers to the gravitation sliding of the ocean plate that is raised above the hotter asthenosphere, thus creating a body force causing sliding of the plate downslope.",
              "[25] In slab pull the weight of a tectonic plate being subducted (pulled) below an overlying plate at a subduction zone drags the rest of the plate along behind it.",
              "The slab pull mechanism is considered to be contributing more than the ridge push.",
              "[24][26] A process previously proposed to contribute to plate motion and the formation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges is the \"mantle conveyor\" due to deep convection (see image).",
              "[27][28] However, some studies have shown that the upper mantle (asthenosphere) is too plastic (flexible) to generate enough friction to pull the tectonic plate along.",
              "[29][30] Moreover, mantle upwelling that causes magma to form beneath the ocean ridges appears to involve only its upper 400 km (250 mi), as deduced from seismic tomography and observations of the seismic discontinuity in the upper mantle at about 400 km (250 mi).",
              "On the other hand, some of the world's largest tectonic plates such as the North American Plate and South American plate are in motion, yet only are being subducted in restricted locations such as the Lesser Antilles Arc and Scotia Arc, pointing to action by the ridge push body force on these plates.",
              "Computer modeling of the plates and mantle motions suggest that plate motion and mantle convection are not connected, and the main plate driving force is slab pull.",
              "[31] Increased rates of seafloor spreading (i.",
              "e. the rate of expansion of the mid-ocean ridge) have caused the global (eustatic) sea level to rise over very long timescales (millions of years).",
              "[32][33] Increased seafloor spreading means that the mid-ocean ridge will then expand and form a broader ridge with decreased average depth, taking up more space in the ocean basin.",
              "This displaces the overlying ocean and causes sea levels to rise.",
              "[34] Sealevel change can be attributed to other factors (thermal expansion, ice melting, and mantle convection creating dynamic topography[35]).",
              "Over very long timescales, however, it is the result of changes in the volume of the ocean basins which are, in turn, affected by rates of seafloor spreading along the mid-ocean ridges.",
              "[36] The 100 to 170 meters higher sea level of the Cretaceous Period (144\u201365 Ma) is partly attributed to plate tectonics because thermal expansion and the absence of ice sheets only account for some of the extra sea level.",
              "[34] Seafloor spreading on mid-ocean ridges is a global scale ion-exchange system.",
              "[37] Hydrothermal vents at spreading centers introduce various amounts of iron, sulfur, manganese, silicon, and other elements into the ocean, some of which are recycled into the ocean crust.",
              "Helium-3, an isotope that accompanies volcanism from the mantle, is emitted by hydrothermal vents and can be detected in plumes within the ocean.",
              "[38] Fast spreading rates will expand the mid-ocean ridge causing basalt reactions with seawater to happen more rapidly.",
              "The magnesium/calcium ratio will be lower because more magnesium ions are being removed from seawater and consumed by the rock, and more calcium ions are being removed from the rock and released into seawater.",
              "Hydrothermal activity at the ridge crest is efficient in removing magnesium.",
              "[39] A lower Mg/Ca ratio favors the precipitation of low-Mg calcite polymorphs of calcium carbonate (calcite seas).",
              "[40][41] Slow spreading at mid-ocean ridges has the opposite effect and will result in a higher Mg/Ca ratio favoring the precipitation of aragonite and high-Mg calcite polymorphs of calcium carbonate (aragonite seas).",
              "[41] Experiments show that most modern high-Mg calcite organisms would have been low-Mg calcite in past calcite seas,[42] meaning that the Mg/Ca ratio in an organism's skeleton varies with the Mg/Ca ratio of the seawater in which it was grown.",
              "The mineralogy of reef-building and sediment-producing organisms is thus regulated by chemical reactions occurring along the mid-ocean ridge, the rate of which is controlled by the rate of sea-floor spreading.",
              "[39][42] The first indications that a ridge bisects the Atlantic Ocean basin came from the results of the British Challenger expedition in the nineteenth century.",
              "[43] Soundings from lines dropped to the seafloor were analyzed by oceanographers Matthew Fontaine Maury and Charles Wyville Thomson and revealed a prominent rise in the seafloor that ran down the Atlantic basin from north to south.",
              "Sonar echo sounders confirmed this in the early twentieth century.",
              "[44] It was not until after World War II, when the ocean floor was surveyed in more detail, that the full extent of mid-ocean ridges became known.",

              "Other research showed that the ridge crest was seismically active[45] and fresh lavas were found in the rift valley.",
              "[46] Also, crustal heat flow was higher here than elsewhere in the Atlantic Ocean basin.",
              "[47] At first, the ridge was thought to be a feature specific to the Atlantic Ocean.",
              "However, as surveys of the ocean floor continued around the world, it was discovered that every ocean contains parts of the mid-ocean ridge system.",

              "In the Southern Hemisphere the Pacific and Atlantic mix in the relatively narrow Drake Passage between Tierra del Fuego in South America and Graham Land in Antarctica, and the Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean meet at the 60\u00b0 S parallel.",
              "The separation between the Pacific and Indian oceans is less distinct, but generally it is considered to lie along the line of islands extending eastward from Sumatra, through Java to Timor, thence across the Timor Sea to Cape Londonderry in Australia.",
              "To the south of Australia the boundary extends across the Bass Strait and thence from Tasmania to 60\u00b0 S.",
              "Because of the pattern of major mountain systems of the globe, a relatively small proportion (one-seventh) of the total continental drainage enters the Pacific\u2014a total drainage area of less than about three times the total area of Australia.",

              "Except for its extreme northern and southern sections, which are characterized by fjords and their numerous off-lying islands, and except for the deeply indented Gulf of California, the coastal boundary is relatively regular and the continental shelf narrow.",
              "The western, or Asiatic, coastal boundary, in contrast, is irregular.",
              "Although the mountain systems there lie roughly parallel to the coast, as they do on the eastern Pacific coastlands, the western Pacific is noted for its many marginal seas.",
              "From north to south they include the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan (East Sea), the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea.",
              "Their eastern boundaries are formed by southward-jutting peninsulas or island arcs or both.",
              "It is of oceanographic significance that the great rivers of eastern Asia\u2014including the Amur, the Huang He (Yellow River), the Yangtze, the Xi and Pearl (Zhu), and the Mekong\u2014enter the Pacific indirectly by way of the marginal seas.",

              "The eastern Pacific region, which extends southward from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, is relatively narrow and is associated with the American cordilleran system of almost unbroken mountain chains, the coastal ranges of which rise steeply from the western shores of North and South America.",
              "The continental shelf, which runs parallel to it, is narrow, while the adjacent continental slope is very steep.",
              "Significant oceanic trenches in this region are the Middle America Trench in the North Pacific and the Peru-Chile Trench in the South Pacific.",
              "The seaward boundary of the western Pacific region is marked by a broken line of oceanic trenches, extending from the Aleutian Trench in the north through the Kuril and Japan trenches and southward to the Tonga and Kermadec trenches, terminating close to the northeast of North Island, New Zealand.",
              "Its structure is more complex than that of the eastern region.",
              "Characteristically associated with the ocean trenches of the western region are festoons of either peninsulas or islands or both.",
              "The islands, which include those of Japan as well as numerous smaller islands, represent the upper parts of mountain systems that rise abruptly from the deep ocean floor.",
              "The island clusters of the western Pacific form the boundaries of the several wide and deep continental seas of the region.",
              "The central Pacific region lies between the boundaries of the eastern and western regions.",
              "The largest and the most geologically stable of the structural provinces of the Earth\u2019s crust, it is characterized by expansive areas of low relief, lying at a general depth of about 15,000 feet (4,600 metres) below the surface.",
              "To the east of longitude 150\u00b0 W, the relief of the ocean floor is considerably less pronounced than it is to the west.",
              "In the eastern Pacific the Cocos Ridge extends southwestward from the Central American isthmus to the Galapagos Islands.",
              "To the south of the Galapagos lies the Peru Basin, which is separated by the extensive Sala y Go\u0301mez Ridge from the Southeast Pacific Basin, which in turn is separated from the Southwest Pacific Basin by the East Pacific Rise and indeterminate Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, which runs from the Sala y Go\u0301mez Ridge to Antarctica in the vicinity of 150\u00b0 W.",
              "Extending southward from the Tasman Basin (between New Zealand and eastern Australia) is the Macquarie Ridge, which forms a major boundary between the deep waters of the Pacific and Indian oceans.",

              "The submerged parts of the series of ridges that are capped by the island archipelagoes of the western Pacific are continuous and are to be found at depths of less than about 2,000 feet (610 metres).",
              "These ridges include the Aleutian Ridge in the northwestern Pacific;",
              "the series of ridges extending southward through the Kuril, Bonin, and Mariana island groups, and the archipelagoes of Yap and Palau;",
              "those extending eastward from New Guinea, including the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon and Santa Cruz island chains;",
              "and, finally, the ridges extending southward, from which rise the Samoa, Tonga, Kermadec, and Chatham island groups, as well as Macquarie Island.",
              "Apart from the narrow coastal zone of the eastern region and the broad continental seas of the western region, the Pacific is floored with pelagic (oceanic) material derived from the remains of marine plants and animals that once inhabited the waters lying above.",
              "Red or brown radiolarian ooze is found along the zone of the Pacific North Equatorial Current, east of longitude 170\u00b0 W, and on the floors of some deep Indonesian basins.",
              "A belt of diatom ooze occurs between latitudes 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 S and across the North Pacific, between Japan and Alaska.",
              "Calcareous globigerina ooze occurs in the shallower parts of the South Pacific, the dissolving power of the seawater at great depths being sufficient to dissolve calcareous material to such an extent that these oozes are not generally found at depths in excess of about 15,000 feet (4,600 metres).",
              "Silica-containing material, such as radiolarian and diatom ooze, is found at greater depths, but even these siliceous remains are dissolved at very great depths, where the characteristic deposit is red clay.",
              "Red clay, which covers no less than half of the Pacific floor, is believed to be formed of colloidal (extremely finely divided) clays derived essentially from the land.",
              "On the abyssal plains, where sediments accumulate slowly, chemical and biological processes lead to the formation of metal-bearing coatings around objects such as the ear bones of fishes.",
              "The nodules so formed contain manganese, iron, nickel, copper, cobalt, and traces of other metals such as platinum.",
              "They cover large areas of the ocean floor in the Pacific.",
              "Similar processes form coatings, called manganese crusts, on the rock surfaces of seamounts.",
              "Among the many different forms of land-derived muds (formed by the erosive action of rivers, tides, and currents) that floor the continental shelves and slopes of the Pacific, the yellow mud of the Yellow Sea is of particular interest.",
              "The mud is conveyed to the seabed by the Huang He, which drains a vast area of northern China blanketed with loess, a fine-grained soil.",
              "The islands of the western region\u2014including the Aleutians, the Kurils, the Ryukyus, Taiwan, the Malay Archipelago (including New Guinea), and New Zealand\u2014are continental in character.",
              "Geologically, they consist partly of sedimentary rocks, and their structures are similar to those of the coastal mountain ranges of the adjacent continent.",
              "A geologically important boundary between the continental, or \u201chigh,\u201d islands and the numerous truly oceanic, or \u201clow,\u201d islands of the Pacific is the Andesite Line, a region of intense volcanic and seismic activity.",
              "In the northern and western Pacific the Andesite Line follows close to seaward the trend of the island arcs from the Aleutians southward to the Yap and Palau arcs, thence eastward through the Bismarck, Solomon, and Santa Cruz archipelagoes, and thence southward through the Samoa, Tonga, and Chatham groups and Macquarie Island to Antarctica.",
              "Islands to the west of the line are rich in andesite, a type of intrusive igneous rock;",
              "islands to the east (oceanic side) of it are essentially of basalt, an extrusive igneous rock.",
              "The numerous oceanic islands of the Pacific are unevenly distributed.",
              "They lie, in the main, between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn and occur in great numbers in the western Pacific.",
              "The northernmost chain of oceanic islands is associated with the Hawaiian Ridge.",
              "The Hawaiian archipelago consists of about 2,000 islands, although the term Hawaiian Islands is usually applied to the small group that lies at the eastern end of the archipelago.",
              "The numerous small islands of Micronesia lie mainly north of the Equator and to the west of the 180\u00b0 meridian.",
              "Nearly all are coralline;",
              "the principal groups are the Marianas, the Marshalls, the Carolines, Kiribati (Gilbert Islands), and Tuvalu (Ellice Islands).",
              "To the south of Micronesia lies Melanesia, which consists mostly of small coral islands.",
              "The region\u2019s physiography is dominated by a group of large continental islands, however, including New Guinea.",

              "The immense area of Polynesia includes the Hawaiian Islands, the Phoenix Islands, Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands, the Society Islands, Tuamotu, and the Marquesas.",
              "Evidence drawn from various geophysical fields\u2014seismology, volcanology, gravimetry, and paleomagnetism (remanent magnetism)\u2014points to the general validity of the theory of plate tectonics.",
              "All the major physical features in the Pacific are understood to originate in plate tectonics.",
              "The western Pacific arcs of volcanic islands and deep trenches are convergent zones where two plates are colliding, one being subducted (forced under the other).",
              "The East Pacific Rise is an active spreading centre where new crust is being created.",
              "The northeastern Pacific margin is the strike-slip zone where the American Plate and the Pacific Plate are gliding laterally past each other via the major San Andreas Fault system.",
              "In the southeastern Pacific, however, the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate are colliding to form the Andes Mountains along western South America and, a short distance offshore, the Peru-Chile Trench.",
              "The floor of the northeastern Pacific is remarkable for its several major fracture zones, which extend east and west and which, in some instances, are identifiable over distances of thousands of miles.",
              "Of great geologic interest are the seamounts (submerged volcanoes), guyots (flat-topped seamounts), and oceanic islands of the Pacific.",
              "The numerous tropical islands of the Pacific are mainly coralline.",
              "The principal types of coral reefs\u2014fringing, barrier, and atoll\u2014as well as the guyots, which rise within the Pacific from the ocean floor in latitudes north and south of the tropics, are explained partially by the slow subsidence theory advanced by the English naturalist Charles Darwin during the 19th century and partially by the theory of plate tectonics.",
              "The wind and pressure systems of the Pacific conform closely to the planetary system\u2014the patterns of air pressure and the consequent wind patterns that develop in the atmosphere of the Earth as a result of its rotation (Coriolis force) and the inclination of its axis (ecliptic) toward the Sun.",
              "They are, in essence, a three-celled latitudinal arrangement of the atmospheric circulation, with the systems in the Northern and Southern hemispheres mirroring each other on opposite sides of the Equator.",
              "The vast extent of open water in the Pacific influences wind and pressure patterns over it, and climatic conditions in the southern and eastern Pacific\u2014where the steadiness of the trade winds and the westerlies is remarkable\u2014are the most uniform on the globe.",
              "In the North Pacific, however, conditions are not so uniform, particularly the considerable climatic differences between the eastern and western regions in the same latitude.",

              "95% of the ocean is unexplored and has never been seen by human eyes.",
              "You might be asking yourself: Why is that?",
              "First of all, ocean exploration technology is relatively new.",
              "Of course, human beings have always explored the ocean\u2019s surface, but it was only in the last few decades that we were able to start discovering its depths and floors.",
              "Of course, with satellites we can chart the ocean surface temperatures, waters and color (which is an indicator of plant life), but we need much more advanced technology to map its deeper parts: like deep sea submarines and sonars.",
              "Also, it is difficult to see in deep water.",
              "Another reason for the relatively small amount of ocean we have explored is that, at great depths, exploration conditions become extreme.",
              "The so-called \u201csunlight zone\u201d ends at about 200 meters below the surface, making imaging much trickier, and pressure is extremely high.",
              "Basically, it is easier to send a person in space than it is to get the bottom of the ocean!",
              "In fact, scientists know more about the surface of the Moon than they do about the ocean\u2019s floor.",
              "Why is it so important to explore the ocean and find out all we can about its huge ecosystem?",
              "Unfortunately, nowadays, the ocean is facing some serious issues that compromise its balance and that of the whole planet.",
              "One of the main threats to its balance is ocean pollution through oil spills, littering and improper manufacturing plants.",
              "The ocean is not only the largest ecosystem on Earth, it also generates over half the oxygen we breathe on the planet through some tiny plants that live on its surface (Phytoplankton), and impacts climate on a global scale.",
              "Protecting the ocean is therefore one of the biggest actions we can take to reduce the effects of climate change.",
              "And, the more we know about it, the more efficient we can become at safeguarding its health and that of the planet.",
              "Biological oceanography studies life within marine environments.",
              "Ecosystems are often a delicate balance, and knowing more about the ocean\u2019s inhabitants is crucial if we want to safeguard their life.",
              "Research can help us better manage the impacts of modern society on the most important ecosystems on Earth with better policies and regulations.",
              "Knowing more about the ocean will also help in deepening our knowledge on the close relationship humans have with it.",
              "By better understanding the dynamics of this vast underwater universe, we will be able to improve the way we relate to it and appreciate its importance in our life: for our health and that of the planet, but also for the economy, transportation and recreation sectors.",

              "In some places, forests of fern-like fronds covered the ocean floor, but since they grew at depths beyond where light could reach they obtained energy by absorbing nutrients, like carbon, directly from the water rather than through photosynthesis.",
              "Unlike the filter feeding invertebrates of today, such as sea pens, these Ediacaran fronds likely did not have digestive organs and instead directly absorbed simple molecules, in a similar manner as bacteria.",

              "Plants began to grow on land during the Ordovician, followed by invertebrates during the Silurian and finally vertebrates during the late Devonian.",
              "These early land dwellers were amphibian-like, eventually giving rise to reptiles by the end of the era.",
              "The Cambrian period occurred approximately 542-488 million years ago and included the biggest evolutionary explosion in Earth\u2019s history.",
              "Some researchers think this happened due to a combination of a warming climate, more oxygen in the ocean, and the creation of extensive shallow-water marine habitats.",
              "This environment would be ideal for the proliferation of new types of animals, including those that were larger and more complex in their body shapes and ecologies than their ancestors.",
              "The world\u2019s first predators took to scanning the seabed from above or hiding in the sediments of the seafloor as disguised ambushers.",

              "Though the first creatures to have shells arose in the Ediacaran, by the Cambrian this body feature became more common and it would prove as a critical defense mechanism against hungry predators.",
              "Many of these creatures were discovered in the Burgess Shale, an area of the Canadian Rockies with a large deposit of preserved Cambrian-age fossils The largest and most fearsome looking predators to roam the seas during the Cambrian were the anomalocarids.",
              "The largest intact specimens discovered reach up to 3 feet in length.",
              "Some species of anomalocarids used two curled appendages to capture their prey and reel it in to a square ring of jagged teeth.",
              "They would also use crushing jaws to tear through the protective armor of hard creatures like trilobites.",
              "But unlike many of its relatives, one species of anomalocarid doesn't seem to be an apex predator.",
              "Like the whale shark and basking shark of today, the large shrimp-like creature called Tamisiocaris borealis was a filter feeder, and likely the first ever to live in the ocean.",
              "Scientists think the feather-like structures on its head were used to rake plankton from the sea.",
              "The appendages had finely spaced spines, further divided by smaller spines, which would have formed an efficient trap for small plankton.",
              "Another formidable predator, Hurdia victoria has been nicknamed the Tyrannosaurus rex of the Cambrian era due to its relatively large size.",
              "While it never reached the size of the largest anomalocarids, some specimens reached 50 cm (around 20 inches), which was large for a time when most animals were about as big as a fingernail.",
              "Its prey consisted of trilobites and other smaller animals crawling on the seafloor.",
              "But not all predators stalked their prey from above.",
              "The ancient worm Ottoia prolifica lived in a self-constructed u-shaped home below the ocean floor.",
              "From there, Ottoia prolifica ambushed prey, which it would swallow headfirst.",
              "Most of its prey were small shelled animals related to mollusks, as well as worms, though there is evidence that they sometimes resorted to cannibalism.",
              "Despite the impressive adaptations of the world\u2019s first predators, those that were preyed upon soon developed their own line of defenses.",
              "Hallucigenia sparsa, a worm, is notable for the porcupine-like spikes that covered its back\u2014an efficient way to ward off hungry jaws.",
              "Opabinia took a different approach and evolved five mushroom-like eyes that allowed it to see predators approaching from many directions.",
              "Additionally, its segmented portions were filled with fluid in order to be more flexible, an important trait for avoiding capture.",
              "Perhaps the most famous creatures to emerge during the Cambrian were the trilobites.",
              "Relatives of insects, crabs, and spiders, there were over 20,000 trilobite species that lived between the Cambrian and the end of the Paleozoic Era when they went extinct, some 252 million years ago.",
              "Prolific survivors with a segmented body plan that could be easily modified and altered, they soon dominated the seafloor.",
              "It seems no method for catching food was beyond the scope of what a trilobite could do\u2014predation, scavenging, filter feeding, and even forming a symbiotic relationship with bacteria were all methods of feeding employed by at least one species.",
              "There is also evidence that trilobites were social creatures, migrating caravan style across the seafloor and meeting for mass molting events where they collectively shed their hard exoskeletons.",
              "One species even has a trident \u201cfork\u201d that protrudes from his head, an adornment believed to attract the opposite sex.",

              "At first glance, an ichthyosaur looks much like dolphins that live today.",
              "But ichthyosaurs are not mammals, nor are they fish, they are reptiles.",
              "Just as whales and sharks have adapted similar body plans to maximize swimming efficiency, ichthyosaurs evolved streamlined bodies built for swimming.",
              "The first ichthyosaurs that emerged roughly 250 million years ago had horizontally elongated tails and swam by undulating their entire bodies from side to side like an eel.",
              "But as they evolved large crescent shape tails, similar to those of present-day tuna, they began to propel themselves by fanning only their tail.",

              "While ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and turtles reigned supreme since the early Triassic, the first mosasaur didn't emerge until the late Cretaceous, about 99 million years ago.",
              "But in a short period of time, they quickly diversified.",
              "Some developed bulbous teeth that they used to hammer away at oyster-like bivalves, while others developed razor-like teeth that could pierce and shred larger prey, including other mosasaurs.",

              "But about 100 million years ago, during the heyday of the dinosaurs, the majority of reefs were built by mollusks called rudist clams. Like modern clams, rudists were bivalves, with two shells (or valves) joined at a hinge.",

              "Earth is unique among the rocky planets in the Solar System in having oceans of liquid water on its surface.",
              "[2] Liquid water, which is necessary for all known forms of life, continues to exist on the surface of Earth because the planet is at a far enough distance (known as the habitable zone) from the Sun that it does not lose its water, but not so far that low temperatures cause all water on the planet to freeze.",
              "It was long thought that Earth's water did not originate from the planet's region of the protoplanetary disk.",
              "Instead, it was hypothesized water and other volatiles must have been delivered to Earth from the outer Solar System later in its history.",
              "Recent research, however, indicates that hydrogen inside the Earth played a role in the formation of the ocean.",
              "[3] The two ideas are not mutually exclusive, as there is also evidence that water was delivered to Earth by impacts from icy planetesimals similar in composition to asteroids in the outer edges of the asteroid belt.",
              "[4] One factor in estimating when water appeared on Earth is that water is continually being lost to space.",
              "H2O molecules in the atmosphere are broken up by photolysis, and the resulting free hydrogen atoms can sometimes escape Earth's gravitational pull (see: Atmospheric escape).",
              "When the Earth was younger and less massive, water would have been lost to space more easily.",
              "Lighter elements like hydrogen and helium are expected to leak from the atmosphere continually, but isotopic ratios of heavier noble gases in the modern atmosphere suggest that even the heavier elements in the early atmosphere were subject to significant losses.",
              "[4] In particular, xenon is useful for calculations of water loss over time.",
              "Not only is it a noble gas (and therefore is not removed from the atmosphere through chemical reactions with other elements), but comparisons between the abundances of its nine stable isotopes in the modern atmosphere reveal that the Earth lost at least one ocean of water early in its history, between the Hadean and Archean eons.",
              "[5][clarification needed] Any water on Earth during the latter part of its accretion would have been disrupted by the Moon-forming impact (~4.",
              "5 billion years ago), which likely vaporized much of Earth's crust and upper mantle and created a rock-vapor atmosphere around the young planet.",
              "[6][7] The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a majority carbon dioxide atmosphere with hydrogen and water vapor.",
              "Afterward, liquid water oceans may have existed despite the surface temperature of 230 \u00b0C (446 \u00b0F) due to the increased atmospheric pressure of the CO2 atmosphere.",
              "As the cooling continued, most CO2 was removed from the atmosphere by subduction and dissolution in ocean water, but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and mantle cycles appeared.",

              "[20][22] Water has a much lower condensation temperature than other materials that compose the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, such as iron and silicates.",
              "The region of the protoplanetary disk closest to the Sun was very hot early in the history of the Solar System, and it is not feasible that oceans of water condensed with the Earth as it formed.",

              "[21] In this scenario, Earth was able to retain water in some form throughout accretion and major impact events.",
              "This hypothesis is supported by similarities in the abundance and the isotope ratios of water between the oldest known carbonaceous chondrite meteorites and meteorites from Vesta, both of which originate from the Solar System's asteroid belt.",
              "[25][26] It is also supported by studies of osmium isotope ratios, which suggest that a sizeable quantity of water was contained in the material that Earth accreted early on.",
              "[27][28] Measurements of the chemical composition of lunar samples collected by the Apollo 15 and 17 missions further support this, and indicate that water was already present on Earth before the Moon was formed.",
              "[29] One problem with this hypothesis is that the noble gas isotope ratios of Earth's atmosphere are different from those of its mantle, which suggests they were formed from different sources.",
              "[30][31] To explain this observation, a so-called \"late veneer\" theory has been proposed in which water was delivered much later in Earth's history, after the Moon-forming impact.",
              "However, the current understanding of Earth's formation allows for less than 1% of Earth's material accreting after the Moon formed, implying that the material accreted later must have been very water-rich.",
              "Models of early Solar System dynamics have shown that icy asteroids could have been delivered to the inner Solar System (including Earth) during this period if Jupiter migrated closer to the Sun.",
              "[32] Yet a third hypothesis, supported by evidence from molybdenum isotope ratios, suggests that the Earth gained most of its water from the same interplanetary collision that caused the formation of the Moon.",
              "[33] The evidence from 2019 shows that the molybdenum isotopic composition of the Earth's mantle originates from the outer Solar System, likely having brought water to Earth.",

              "[33] Isotopic ratios provide a unique \"chemical fingerprint\" that is used to compare Earth's water with reservoirs elsewhere in the Solar System.",
              "One such isotopic ratio, that of deuterium to hydrogen (D/H), is particularly useful in the search for the origin of water on Earth.",
              "Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and its heavier isotope deuterium can sometimes take the place of a hydrogen atom in molecules like H2O.",
              "Most deuterium was created in the Big Bang or in supernovae, so its uneven distribution throughout the protosolar nebula was effectively \"locked in\" early in the formation of the Solar System.",
              "[34] By studying the different isotopic ratios of Earth and of other icy bodies in the Solar System, the likely origins of Earth's water can be researched.",

              "The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen may have increased over the Earth's lifetime as the lighter isotope is more likely to leak to space in atmospheric loss processes.",
              "However no process is known that can decrease Earth's D/H ratio over time.",
              "[36] This loss of the lighter isotope is one explanation for why Venus has such a high D/H ratio, as that planet's water was vaporized during the runaway greenhouse effect and subsequently lost much of its hydrogen to space.",
              "[37] Because Earth's D/H ratio has increased significantly over time, the D/H ratio of water originally delivered to the planet was lower than at present.",
              "This is consistent with a scenario in which a significant proportion of the water on Earth was already present during the planet's early evolution.",
