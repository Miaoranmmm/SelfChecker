              "The particle was finally discovered on July 4, 2012, by researchers at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \u2014 the most powerful particle accelerator in the world \u2014 located at the European particle physics laboratory CERN, Switzerland.",
              "The LHC confirmed the existence of the Higgs field and the mechanism that gives rise to mass and thus completed the standard model of particle physics \u2014 the best description we have of the subatomic world.",
              "Related: The Higgs boson could have kept our universe from collapsing As scientists approached the end of the 20th Century advances in particle physics had answered many questions that surrounded the fundamental building blocks of nature.",
              "Yet, as physicists steadily populated the particle zoo with electrons, protons, bosons, and all flavors of quarks, some pressing questions remained stubbornly unanswered.",
              "Amongst these, why do some particles have mass?",
              "The story of the Higgs boson is motivated by this question.",
              "The Higgs boson has a mass of 125 billion electron volts \u2014 meaning it is 130 times more massive than a proton , according to CERN.",
              "It is also chargeless with zero spin \u2014 a quantum mechanical equivalent to angular momentum.",
              "The Higgs Boson is the only elementary particle with no spin.",
              "A boson is a \"force carrier\" particle that comes into play when particles interact with each other, with a boson exchanged during this interaction.",
              "For example, when two electrons interact they exchange a photon \u2014 the force-carrying particle of electromagnetic fields.",
              "Because quantum field theory describes the microscopic world and the quantum fields that fill the universe with wave mechanics, a boson can also be described as a wave in a field.",
              "So a photon is a particle and a wave that arises from an excited electromagnetic field and the Higgs boson is the particle or \"quantized manifestation\" that arises from the Higgs field when excited.",
              "That field generates mass via its interaction with other particles and the mechanism carried by the Higgs boson called the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism.",
              "The Higgs boson's nickname \"the God Particle\" was solidified upon its discovery, namely as a result of the popular media.",
              "The origin of this is often connected to Nobel Prize-winning physicist Leon Lederman referring to the Higgs boson as the \"Goddamn Particle\" in frustration with regards to how difficult it was to detect.",
              "Business Insider says that when Lederman authored a book on the Higgs boson in the 1990s the title was to be \"The Goddamn Particle\" but the publishers changed this to \"The God Particle\" and a troublesome connection with religion was drawn, one which bothers physicists to this day.",
              "Still, it's hard to overestimate the importance of the Higgs boson and the Higgs field in general, as without this aspect of nature no particles would have mass.",
              "That means no stars, no planets, and no us \u2014 something which may help warrant its hyperbolic nickname.",
              "In 1964, researchers had begun to use quantum field theory to study the weak nuclear force \u2014 which determines the atomic decay of elements by transforming protons to neutrons \u2014 and its force carriers the W and Z bosons.",
              "The weak force carriers should be massless, and if they weren't this risked breaking a principle of nature called symmetry which \u2014 just like the symmetry of a shape ensures it looks the same if it is turned or flipped \u2014 ensures the laws of nature are the same however they are viewed.",
              "Putting mass arbitrarily onto particles also caused certain predictions to trend towards infinity.",
              "Yet, researchers knew that because the weak force is so strong over short distance interactions \u2014 much more powerful than gravity \u2014 but very weak over longer interactions, its bosons must have mass.",
              "The solution proposed by Peter Higgs Franc\u0327ois Englert, and Robert Brout, in 1964 was a new field and a way to \"trick\" nature into breaking symmetry spontaneously.",

              "Higgs and his fellow physicist proposed that when the universe was born it was filled with the Higgs field in a symmetrical, but unstable state \u2014 like the precariously balanced pencil.",
              "The field quickly, in just fractions of a second, finds a stable configuration, but this in the process breaks its symmetry.",
              "This gives rise to the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism which grants mass to the W and Z bosons.",
              "What was later discovered about the Higgs field was that it would not only give mass to the W and Z bosons but that it would grant mass to many other fundamental particles.",
              "Without the Higgs field and the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism, all fundamental particles would race around the universe at the speed of light.",
              "This theory doesn't just explain why particles have mass but also, why they have different masses.",
              "Particles that interact \u2014 or \"couple\" \u2014 with the Higgs field more strongly are granted greater masses.",
              "Even the Higgs boson itself gets its mass from its own interaction with the Higgs field.",
              "This has been confirmed by watching how Higgs boson particles decay.",
              "One particle not granted mass by the Higgs field is the basic particle of light \u2014 the photon.",
              "This is because spontaneous symmetry breaking doesn't happen for photons as it does for its fellow force-carrying particles the W and Z bosons.",
              "This mass-granting phenomenon also only applies to fundamental particles like electrons and quarks.",
              "Particles like protons \u2014 made up of quarks \u2014 get most of their mass from the binding energy that holds their constituents together.",
              "While all this conforms well to theory, the next step was to discover evidence of the Higgs field by detecting its force-carrying particle.",
              "Doing this would be no simple task, in fact, it would require the largest experiment and most sophisticated machine in human history.",
              "In this way, the search for the Higgs boson itself has pushed both particle accelerator and detector technology to its limits \u2014 with the ultimate expression of this being the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).",
              "Detecting the Higgs boson isn't just a question of setting up a detector and waiting for one to come along.",
              "These particles only existed in the high-energy conditions of the early universe.",
              "That means before detecting this particle, these high-energy conditions have to be replicated and Higgs bosons have to be created.",
              "The LHC does this by accelerating protons to near-light speed and smashing them together.",
              "This creates a cascade of particles that quickly decay into lighter particles.",
              "The Higgs boson decays too rapidly to be spotted and was instead identified by detecting particle decays that indicated a particle with no spin and matched theoretical predictions for this missing boson.",
              "The particle was detected by both the LHC ATLAS detector and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector.",
              "The announcement of the detection of the Higgs boson was made at CERN in Geneva on July 4, 2012.",
              "It took until March the following year to confirm this the detected particle was indeed the Higgs boson.",
              "By revealing this particle, predicted by the standard model the discovery of the Higgs boson completed this picture of the subatomic world.",
              "There are still mysteries beyond this theory such as the nature of dark matter which the Higgs boson \u2014 through its unique properties \u2014 could help solve.",
              "The year after the discovery of the Higgs boson, Peter Higgs and Franc\u0327ois Englert were awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics, for their Higgs field theory.",
              "The Nobel Committee wrote of the award: \"for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.\"",

              "And the investigation of this elusive particle will deepen during run 3 of the LHC and particularly when the particle accelerator's high luminosity upgrade is completed in 2029.",
              "This will allow the LHC to conduct more collisions providing researchers with more opportunities to spot exotic physics including phenomena beyond the standard model.",
              "CERN estimates that following the upgrade each year the accelerator will create 15 million of these particles.",
              "This is compared to 3 million Higgs bosons created by the LHC in 2017.",
              "This may be key to detecting other \"flavors\" of the Higgs boson.",

              "There comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored.",
              "That moment came today for physicists at Cern, near Geneva, home of the Large Hadron Collider, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important Higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science.",
              "In presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on Wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher.",
              "Cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the Higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle.",
              "Formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of Higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of Higgs bosons.",
              "The discovery of more than one kind of Higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics.",
              "\"Is it a Higgs boson or not?",
              "Well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the Standard Model Higgs.",
              "A different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion,\" said Tommaso Dorigo, a scientist on the CMS experimental team at Cern.",
              "The Standard Model Higgs boson is the most simple proposed version of particle.",
              "The queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement.",
              "Those inside broke into applause when Peter Higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room.",
              "\"Cern should really build a larger auditorium.",
              "The present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the Higgs boson,\" said Dorigo.",
              "Scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as Joe Incandela and Fabiola Gianotti, the respective heads of the Large Hadron Collider detector teams called CMS and Atlas, presented their results for the first time.",
              "Both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 GeV, about 130 times the mass of a proton.",

              "They have worked hard and long for this day.",
              "The particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today.",
              "The hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries.",
              "For some, this has been their life's work.",
              "There is never a bad time for good news, but Cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy.",
              "The discovery of the Higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years.",
              "It proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe.",
              "This field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. Without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it.",
              "While scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the Nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work.",
              "Traditionally, Nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later.",
              "Peter Higgs at Edinburgh University was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field.",
              "That was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments.",
              "One of the original gang of six, Robert Brout at the Free University in Brussels, died last year.",
              "The others are Francois Englert from Belgium, Tom Kibble from the UK, and Dick Hagen and Gerry Guralnik in the US.",
              "Peter Higgs said: \"I am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged.",
              "They are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place.",
              "\"I never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge.\"",
              "According to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light.",
              "But one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the Higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue.",
              "Some particles feel the Higgs field more than others.",
              "The quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles.",
              "Others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight.",
              "Particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light.",
              "To find the Higgs particle, physicists at Cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the Large Hadron Collider.",
              "Occasionally, these collisions might create a Higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles.",
              "To spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data.",
              "Particle physicists use a \"sigma\" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five.",
              "One and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data.",
              "A three sigma result counts as an official \"observation\", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong.",
              "Evidence for the Higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months.",
              "In December, the Atlas and CMS teams at Cern reported what appeared to be hints of a Higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (GeV), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton.",
              "On Wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming.",
              "The Atlas team reported a particle at 126.",
              "5GeV with a confidence of five sigma, while the CMS team found a particle with a mass of 125.",
              "3 GeV with a 4.",
              "9 sigma confidence.",
              "At the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles.",

              "Sean Carroll, a physicist at California Institute of Technology, said there was the slightest sign of something unusual in the results.",
              "\"It's clear that the LHC has discovered a new particle.",

              "If the differences are real, they very possibly come from new particles interacting with the Higgs.",
              "The fun has just begun!\"",
              "Ben Allanach, a physicist at Cambridge University, said: \"Rolf was right though when he said 'I think we have it'.\"",
              "Jeff Forshaw, a physicist at Manchester University, said: \"This is sensational news and quite brilliant science.",
              "Without doubt, CERN has delivered us a new particle that looks every bit like the long-sought-after Higgs boson, which is absolutely central to our understanding of how the universe works at its most elemental level.",

              "The strengths of the signals observed independently by CMS and Atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the Tevatron experiments CDF and D0.",

              "Does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses?",
              "\"The discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the Standard Model, and for other physics beyond the Standard Model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter.\"",

              "67 When designing sgRNA, strategies such as GC content, sgRNA length, and chemical modifications of sgRNA must be considered.",
              "Generally speaking, studies revealed that GC content of between 40% and 60%, truncated (short length of sgRNA), and incorporation of 2\u02b9-O-methyl-3\u02b9-phosphonoacetate in the sgRNA ribose-phosphate backbone are the preferred methods to increase genome editing efficiency of CRISPR/Cas-9.",
              "67,68 Modifying the Cas-9 protein to optimize its nuclease specificity is another way to reduce off-target effects.",
              "For instance, mutating either one of the catalytic residues of Cas-9 nuclease (HNH and RuvC) will convert the Cas-9 into nickase that could only generate a single-stranded break instead of a blunt cleavage.",

The waveform, detected by both LIGO observatories,[6] matched the predictions of general relativity[7][8][9] for a gravitational wave emanating from the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes of around 36 and 29 solar masses and the subsequent \"ringdown\" of the single resulting black hole.",

              "It was also heralded as inaugurating a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy, which will enable observations of violent astrophysical events that were not previously possible and potentially allow the direct observation of the very earliest history of the universe.",

              "[22] Eight more observations were made in 2017, including GW170817, the first observed merger of binary neutron stars, which was also observed in electromagnetic radiation.",

              "[26] General relativity interprets gravity as a consequence of distortions in space-time, caused by mass.",
              "Therefore, Einstein also predicted that events in the cosmos would cause \"ripples\" in space-time \u2013 distortions of space-time itself \u2013 which would spread outward, although they would be so minuscule that they would be nearly impossible to detect by any technology foreseen at that time.",
              "[13] It was also predicted that objects moving in an orbit would lose energy for this reason (a consequence of the law of conservation of energy), as some energy would be given off as gravitational waves, although this would be insignificantly small in all but the most extreme cases.",
              "[27] One case where gravitational waves would be strongest is during the final moments of the merger of two compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes.",
              "Over a span of millions of years, binary neutron stars, and binary black holes lose energy, largely through gravitational waves, and as a result, they spiral in towards each other.",
              "At the very end of this process, the two objects will reach extreme velocities, and in the final fraction of a second of their merger a substantial amount of their mass would theoretically be converted into gravitational energy, and travel outward as gravitational waves,[28] allowing a greater than usual chance for detection.",
              "However, since little was known about the number of compact binaries in the universe and reaching that final stage can be very slow, there was little certainty as to how often such events might happen.",
              "[29] Gravitational waves can be detected indirectly \u2013 by observing celestial phenomena caused by gravitational waves \u2013 or more directly by means of instruments such as the Earth-based LIGO or the planned space-based LISA instrument.",
              "[30] Evidence of gravitational waves was first deduced in 1974 through the motion of the double neutron star system PSR B1913+16, in which one of the stars is a pulsar that emits electro-magnetic pulses at radio frequencies at precise, regular intervals as it rotates.",
              "Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor, who discovered the stars, also showed that over time, the frequency of pulses shortened, and that the stars were gradually spiralling towards each other with an energy loss that agreed closely with the predicted energy that would be radiated by gravitational waves.",
              "[31][32] For this work, Hulse and Taylor were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993.",
              "[33] Further observations of this pulsar and others in multiple systems (such as the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039) also agree with General Relativity to high precision.",
              "[34][35] Direct observation of gravitational waves was not possible for the many decades after they were predicted due to the minuscule effect that would need to be detected and separated from the background of vibrations present everywhere on Earth.",
              "A technique called interferometry was suggested in the 1960s and eventually technology developed sufficiently for this technique to become feasible.",
              "In the present approach used by LIGO, a laser beam is split and the two halves are recombined after travelling different paths.",
              "Changes to the length of the paths or the time taken for the two split beams, caused by the effect of passing gravitational waves, to reach the point where they recombine are revealed as \"beats\".",
              "Such a technique is extremely sensitive to tiny changes in the distance or time taken to traverse the two paths.",
              "In theory, an interferometer with arms about 4 km long would be capable of revealing the change of space-time \u2013 a tiny fraction of the size of a single proton \u2013 as a gravitational wave of sufficient strength passed through Earth from elsewhere.",
              "This effect would be perceptible only to other interferometers of a similar size, such as the Virgo, GEO 600 and planned KAGRA and INDIGO detectors.",
              "In practice at least two interferometers would be needed because any gravitational wave would be detected at both of these but other kinds of disturbance would generally not be present at both.",

              "The team alerted the astronomical community to the detection, but no corresponding signal has been found in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum or in neutrinos.",
              "The lack of an optical counterpart isn\u2019t really a surprise, says astrophysicist Coleman Miller of the University of Maryland in College Park.",
              "Two such black holes in a close orbit are likely to sweep their immediate vicinity clear of gas and dust, he explains, and the gravitational radiation released by the merger does not agitate what little material remains enough to emit electromagnetic energy.",
              "Analysis of the signal suggests that the black holes were not spinning very rapidly.",
              "It\u2019s noteworthy that three of the mergers detected so far involved black holes with a few tens of solar masses and little spin, while one event involved black holes of around 14 and 7 solar masses with somewhat higher spin, says gravitational theorist Frans Pretorius of Princeton University.",
              "But he is cautious about identifying patterns in a set of only four detections.",
              "Miller is similarly cautious about drawing conclusions but says that it\u2019s consistent with models of the formation of large black holes, in which angular momentum is carried away by material ejected from the original star.",
              "The combination of Virgo and LIGO also allowed a novel, although preliminary, test of the polarization of the waves, a geometrical property that\u2019s related to the way they disturb spacetime.",
              "In general relativity, gravitational waves have what is called a quadrupole or tensor form.",
              "This polarization means that a wave traveling from left to right, for example, would distort a circle of particles in the vertical plane perpendicular to the propagation direction into, say, a vertical ellipse, then a horizontal ellipse, and then back to vertical again with each wave cycle.",
              "In principle, however, gravity theories based on spacetime curvature can have waves of other forms: scalar, in which the ring of particles would expand and contract as a whole;",
              "and vector, in which particles would move back and forth along the direction of wave propagation.",
              "LIGO\u2019s two L-shaped interferometers are aligned \u201cback-to-back,\u201d pointing away from each other.",
              "This arrangement enhances the sensitivity of the pair for waves coming from some directions but prevents a direct test of polarization.",
              "The different orientation of the Virgo interferometer allowed the team to study polarization and show that the data strongly favor a pure tensor waveform over a pure vector or pure scalar form.",
              "This is the first direct test of the polarization of gravitational waves, says LIGO team member Deirdre Shoemaker of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.",
              "Future tests will try to set limits on the proportion of scalar and vector waves in gravitational radiation, she adds, but a complete analysis of the polarization would require detectors set at five different orientations.",
              "The first collaborative observing run of LIGO and Virgo ended on August 25.",
              "At the September 27 press conference announcing the new discovery, LIGO spokesman David Shoemaker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said that the performance of the LIGO detectors is currently at about half of the design specification and that further fine-tuning should improve the sensitivity.",
              "It\u2019s possible, he added, that with both LIGO detectors performing at their best, researchers could see black hole mergers as often as once a week, making gravitational wave observations a reliable astronomical tool.",

              "[54] Lee, playing black, opened with a High Chinese formation and generated a large area of black influence, which AlphaGo invaded at move 12.",
              "This required the program to defend a weak group, which it did successfully.",
              "[54] An Younggil described Lee's move 31 as possibly the \"losing move\"[54] and Andy Jackson of the American Go Association considered that the outcome had already been decided by move 35.",

              "Lee counterattacked at moves 77/79, but AlphaGo's response was effective and its move 90 succeeded in simplifying the position.",
              "It then gained a large area of control at the bottom of the board, strengthening its position with moves from 102 to 112 described by An as \"sophisticated\".",
              "[54] Lee attacked again at moves 115 and 125, but AlphaGo's responses were again effective.",

              "[54] Lee (white) won the fourth game.",
              "Lee chose to play a type of extreme strategy, known as amashi, in response to AlphaGo's apparent preference for Souba Go (attempting to win by many small gains when the opportunity arises), taking territory at the perimeter rather than the center.",
              "[57] By doing so, his apparent aim was to force an \"all or nothing\" style of situation \u2013 a possible weakness for an opponent strong at negotiation types of play, and one which might make AlphaGo's capability of deciding slim advantages largely irrelevant.",
              "[57] The first 11 moves were identical to the second game, where Lee also played white.",
              "In the early game, Lee concentrated on taking territory in the edges and corners of the board, allowing AlphaGo to gain influence in the top and centre.",
              "Lee then invaded AlphaGo's region of influence at the top with moves 40 to 48, following the amashi strategy.",
              "AlphaGo responded with a shoulder hit at move 47, subsequently sacrificing four stones elsewhere, and gaining the initiative with moves 47 to 53 and 69.",

              "However, an unexpected play at white 78, described as \"a brilliant tesuji\", turned the game around.",
              "[57] The move developed a white wedge at the centre, and increased the game's complexity.",
              "[58] Gu Li (9p) described it as a \"divine move\" and stated that the move had been completely unforeseen by him.",
              "[57] AlphaGo responded poorly on move 79, at which time it estimated it had a 70% chance to win the game.",
              "Lee followed up with a strong move at white 82.",
              "[57] AlphaGo's initial response in moves 83 to 85 was appropriate, but at move 87, its estimate of its chances to win suddenly plummeted,[59][non-primary source needed][60][non-primary source needed] provoking it to make a series of very bad moves from black 87 to 101.",
              "David Ormerod characterised moves 87 to 101 as typical of Monte Carlo-based program mistakes.",

              "[57] AlphaGo's resignation was triggered when it evaluated its chance of winning to be less than 20%;",
              "this is intended to match the decision of professionals who resign rather than play to the end when their position is felt to be irrecoverable.",
              "[58] An Younggil at Go Game Guru concluded that the game was \"a masterpiece for Lee Sedol and will almost certainly become a famous game in the history of Go\".",

              "Her case represents the second trial of gene-editing as a therapy \u2014 the first was carried out last year in patients with HIV.",
              "More similar trials are planned \u2014 and companies are also preparing to trial therapies that inject DNA that codes for gene-editing enzymes directly into the human body.",
              "Immunologist Waseem Qasim of Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust in London, whose team treated the girl, says that his team had planned to start a safety trial next year in 10\u201312 patients.",
              "But when the researchers came across the baby, in whom all other treatments had failed, they were able to obtain special permission to treat her with the new technology, developed by researchers from Cellectis, a company headquartered in Paris.",
              "Several months after the procedure, Qasim says that she is doing well.",
              "His team will present the case in December at an American Society of Hematology meeting in Orlando, Florida.",
              "A bridge to a cure To administer the therapy, the researchers extract immune cells called T-cells from a healthy donor, and expose them to a type of DNA-cutting enzyme called a TALEN.",
              "The enzyme deactivates immune genes that would otherwise cause the donor cells to attack when injected into a person with leukaemia, and modifies genes to protect the new cells from anti-cancer drugs that the patient is taking.",
              "The individual then undergoes therapy to destroy his or her own immune system, which is replaced with the modified cells.",
              "The treatment is not a permanent solution for leukaemia patients, says Qasim, but rather a \u2019bridge\u2018 to keep the person alive until a matched T cell donor can be found.",
              "The first ever use of gene-editing in people employed a similar ex-vivo approach.",
              "Last year, Sangamo BioSciences in Richmond, California, published results1 from a clinical trial in which it used gene-edited cells to treat 12 people with HIV.",
              "Instead of TALENs, the researchers used a different class of DNA-cutting enzyme called a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN).",
              "When added to blood extracted from the patients, the ZFNs cut the gene for a protein on T-cells targeted by HIV, and the team then pumped the cells back into the patients.",
              "The results were positive \u2014 at the time of the announcement, half of the participants were cleared to stop taking their antiretroviral drugs \u2014 and Sangamo tells Nature that it has now treated more than 70 patients with the therapy.",
              "Haemophilia hope For some diseases, however, it makes more sense to edit the genome in vivo \u2014 for example, if the target cells are in an organ or tissue type harder to remove than blood.",
              "In a study presented in October at a meeting of the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in Washington DC, Sangamo senior scientist Fyodor Urnov reported that his group had injected 15 monkeys with viruses that carried genes encoding ZFN and normal versions of factor IX \u2014 a blood-clotting protein produced by the liver, which is mutated in people with haemophilia B.",
              "The ZFN cut the genome at a section that encodes a protein called albumin, which is made in large quantities in the liver, and inserted a healthy version of the factor-IX gene.",
              "The team found that the monkey\u2019s livers began producing much more factor IX: the protein's levels in the blood increased by 10%.",
              "Urnov says that the site could be a good place to insert other genes2, and likens the albumin gene to \"a USB port in the human genome\u201d.",
              "A committee at the US National Institutes of Health, which approves all clinical trials involving modified DNA, gave the green light to human trials of the factor-IX therapy in September, according to Urnov, but Sangamo must still get permission from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
              "Urnov says that the company will apply by the end of the year and, if successful, that trials could begin in early 2016.",
              "Sangamo also plans to apply for permission to do several other in vivo gene-editing trials, including of therapies for the blood diseases haemoglobinopathy and \u00df-thalassaemia.",
              "Sangamo is not the only company with plans to start testing the approach in people.",
              "On 3 November, biotechnology start-up Editas Medicine in Cambridge, Massachusetts, announced that, by 2017, it hopes to start trials of a therapy that involves gene-editing in vivo.",
              "The researchers would inject DNA encoding the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system into the eyes of people with a rare retinal disorder called Leber congenital amaurosis to correct a mutated gene.",
              "Growing concerns Therapies both ex vivo and in vivo could cause cuts and mutations elsewhere in the genome, but the in-vivo variety introduces another concern because the DNA-delivering vector can remain active in the body for years after injection.",
              "Biologist Valder Arruda of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, who is exploring factor-IX gene-therapy approaches for haemophilia, worries that this could have unforeseen effects, such as an immune reaction to the DNA-cutting enzyme.",
              "Sangamo, however, says that it has not seen evidence of such destructive effects in its animal studies.",
              "Other challenges of editing in vivo, says Qasim, include ensuring that enough of the target cells actually get edited and that the vector delivers its payload to the right part of the body.",
              "Meanwhile, the list of disorders that editing in vivo could help to treat is growing.",
              "In a study presented at a synthetic-biology meeting in April, biomedical engineer Charles Gersbach at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, reported injecting a viral vector that coded for a DNA-cutting enzyme into the muscles of mice with the mutation responsible for muscular dystrophy, a muscle-wasting disease.",
              "The injections corrected the gene in about 20% of muscle cells \u2014 enough to substantially improve their muscle tone and strength.",

The moment when quantum computing can seriously threaten to compromise the security of digital communications remains many years, if not decades, in the future.",
              "But the leaked draft of Google\u2019s paper likely represents the first experimental proof of the long-held theoretical premise that quantum computers can outperform even the most powerful modern supercomputers on certain tasks, experts say.",

              "While the term supremacy is a bit of an exaggeration, as it concerns just one application, it shows that quantum computers with their qubits, albeit still years from commercialization in all likelihood, have finally reached a point where they have solved a problem that no transistor-based computer or supercomputer could ever solve, essentially proving that quantum computers indeed work.",
