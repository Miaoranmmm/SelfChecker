    "response": "That's a great question. There have been many amazing discoveries and advancements in astronomy in the past decade that have expanded our knowledge and curiosity about the universe. Here are some of the most significant ones:\n\n- The first observation of gravitational waves by the LIGO detectors in 2015, confirming Einstein's prediction of ripples in space-time caused by massive cosmic events like black hole mergers[^1^] [^3^].\n- The first direct image of a black hole by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019, revealing the shadow of the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy M87[^1^].\n- The discovery of thousands of exoplanets by various missions like Kepler, TESS, and Gaia, including some potentially habitable ones like Proxima b and TRAPPIST-1e[^1^] [^2^].\n- The exploration of Pluto and its moons by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2015, revealing a complex and diverse world with mountains, glaciers, and a possible subsurface ocean[^1^].\n- The landing of Curiosity rover on Mars in 2012 and Perseverance rover in 2021, both equipped with advanced instruments to study the geology, climate, and potential habitability of the red planet[^1^].\n- The detection of organic molecules and seasonal variations of methane on Mars by Curiosity rover, suggesting possible biological or geological sources[^1^].\n- The arrival of Juno spacecraft at Jupiter in 2016 and Cassini spacecraft at Saturn in 2004, both providing unprecedented insights into the structure, atmosphere, magnetism, and moons of these giant planets[^1^].\n- The encounter of Rosetta spacecraft with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014, becoming the first mission to orbit and land on a comet and study its composition and activity[^1^].\n- The discovery of interstellar objects 'Oumuamua and Borisov passing through our solar system in 2017 and 2019, respectively, offering clues about the origin and diversity of other planetary systems[^1^].\n- The first detection of phosphine gas in the atmosphere of Venus by ALMA telescope in 2020, raising the possibility of microbial life on our neighboring planet[^1^].\n\nThese are just some examples of the remarkable achievements and discoveries made by astronomers and space explorers in the past decade.

              "A laser beam of light is generated and directed toward a beam splitter, which splits it into two separate and equal beams. The light beams then travel perpendicularly to a distant mirror, with each arm of the device being 4 kilometers in length.",
              "The mirrors reflect the light back to the beam splitter, repeating this process 200 times.",
              "When gravitational waves pass through this device, they cause the length of the two arms to alternately stretch and squeeze by infinitesimal amounts, tremendously exaggerated here for visibility.",
              "This movement causes the light beam that hits the detector to flicker.",
              "The second half of the animation explains the flickering, and this is where light interference comes into play.",

              "Normally, when no gravitational waves are present, the distance between the beam splitter and the mirror is precisely controlled so that the light waves are kept out of phase with each other and cancel each other out.",
              "The result is that no light hits the detectors.",
              "But when gravitational waves pass through the system, the distance between the end mirrors and the beam splitter lengthen in one arm and at the same time shorten in the other arm in such a way that the light waves from the two arms go in and out of phase with each other.",
              "When the light waves are in phase with each other, they add together constructively and produce a bright beam that illuminates the detectors.",

              "Curious about Methane and Organic Molecules on Mars",
              "At the 2014 Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), scientists announced two important discoveries made by NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover.",
              "The findings included Curiosity\u2019s detection of organic molecules in drill samples taken from a mudstone that once sat on the bottom of and ancient martian lake.",
              "The second finding was a spike in levels of atmospheric methane at the rover\u2019s research site.",
              "Curiosity is the rover element of NASA\u2019s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission and landed on Mars in 2012.",
              "One of the key goals of MSL is to explore the potential for past or present habitable environments on Mars, and part of this objective is to search for organic compounds of either biological or non-biological origins.",
              "To accomplish this goal, Curiosity has been examining the martian regolith, drilling into martian rocks and taking samples of the planet\u2019s atmosphere.",
              "Organic Findings Curiosity carries the most powerful tool for studying volatiles (chemicals with low boiling points often found in gaseous form) and organic compounds (molecules containing carbon and hydrogen) ever sent to Mars: the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite.",
              "So far, SAM has made thirty-four measurements from ten different sites on the planet.",
              "The first was a scoop of wind-deposited sand and dust at a place called Rocknest.",
              "The elemental composition of the samples was similar to soils previously studied by the Mars Exploration Rovers, Opportunity and Spirit.",
              "This meant that the windblown materials were likely widespread on Mars and could have been blown into Curiosity\u2019s landing site from further afield.",
              "Curiosity also found methane, a carbon-containing molecule composed of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. However, the methane was chlorine-bearing, meaning that one or more of the hydrogen atoms had been replaced by chlorine.",
              "The thought was that the chlorine came from sources on Mars, but the carbon came from terrestrial sources.",
              "Curiosity then traveled into a region called Yellowknife Bay and found evidence of an ancient lake of liquid water and a flowing river in the area.",
              "The rover drilled two holes (John Klein and Cumberland) in a formation of mudstone rock informally dubbed \u2018Sheepbed,\u2019 which formed more than 3.",
              "5 billion years ago at the bottom of the lake.",
              "Curiosity found that the clay-rich composition of the mudstone was ideal for preserving organic molecules.",
              "In addition, chorine-bearing hydrocarbon molecules were present, but in larger quantities than in the windblown materials at Rocknest.",
              "The quantity and structure of the molecules suggested that the organic carbon could have come from the mudstone itself, or that it was at least present on Mars before Curiosity arrived.",
              "This discovery is what led researchers to announce that organics had definitely been identified on Mars.",
              "This announcement at the AGU conference was followed by a paper, \u201cOrganic molecules in the Sheepbed Mudstone, Gale Crater, Mars,\u201d which featured on the cover of the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets (1).",
              "The publication describes how data from Curiosity, combined with the analysis of blank samples and supporting laboratory experiments, provided the necessary evidence to conclude that organic molecules indigenous to the martian sample had been detected.",
              "Since publication, the team has continued their work, delving deeper into the findings at Cumberland (CB) and making sure that they could not be the result of contamination or any other error.",
              "Additional molecules indigenous to the CB sample were later discovered in the same set of data, and further publications are now in preparation.",
              "The research team uses SAM to perform a technique known as pyrolysis-GCMS.",
              "The samples are pyrolyzed (heated) to ~900 oC and the gases that evolve from them are flushed into the instrument for separation by gas chromatography (GC) and identification using a mass spectrometer (MS).",
              "Researchers can then look at the molecules, specifically identifying some, and for others they are able to figure out the pathways that led to their formation.",
              "Information about their chemical properties can also be gleaned, providing a great deal of information about the original/precursor compounds from which they were derived.",
              "The SAM team also developed and used derivatization.",
              "In this technique, a reagent reacts with compounds found in the sample, and those compounds are transformed into new ones of similar structure, known as derivatives.",
              "Those derivatives are more volatile than their precursors and can be analyzed more easily.",
              "This allows researchers to identify bigger molecules such as amino acids or carboxylic acids, which are typically degradation products of proteins or fatty acids.",
              "The samples collected by Curiosity, whether sand or rock, contain a mixture of chemical compounds.",
              "Pyrolysis-GCMS and derivatization-GCMS helps scientists separate the different compounds in order to understand the composition of the sample.",
              "\u201cFollowing the first Cumberland (CB) pyrolysis-GCMS results, we ran a derivatization experiment on a CB sample we kept in SAM for a year,\u201d said Caroline Freissinet, an astrobiologist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center.",
              "\u201cThere was a leak in one of our derivatization cups, and the derivatization reagent MTBSTFA was spreading in the samples held in SAM.",

              "Rather than trying to stop MTBSTFA leaking into samples, they allowed enough time to take advantage of the leak and maximize the amount of MTBSTFA in order to soak the CB sample.",
              "Then they performed the derivatization experiment without having to puncture a cup.",
              "\u201cFrom this opportunistic derivatization experiment, we detected complex molecules that are difficult to identify specifically,\u201d explained Freissinet.",

              "Curiosity and the team behind SAM didn\u2019t stop with the Cumberland samples.",

              "A new drill sample dubbed Confidence Hills was collected and, with this sample, scientists were able to announce that the detection of organic molecules at CB was indeed definitive evidence of organics that were martian in origin.",
              "Simply finding organic molecules does not mean they are linked to life.",
              "These molecules, which are typically built from atoms of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, can be made in a myriad of ways that do not involve living organisms. However, life is built from these types of molecules and their discovery can help astrobiologists determine whether or not the ingredients for life\u2019s origin were present on ancient Mars when liquid water was available at the surface.",
              "\u201cThe origin of this organic matter (biological vs. abiotic) cannot be determined, and both hypotheses are valid,\u201d said Freissinet.",
              "\u201cHence, the organic matter may be exogenous from meteorites, micrometeorites or comets, or indigenous from hydrothermal formation or biological origin.",
              "\u201d Yet, proving that the carbon did not come from Curiosity itself is a big step, and now the question is, \u201cwhere on Mars did it come from?",
              "\u201d As Freissinet mentions, there are a few possible answers to this question.",
              "The carbon might be from Mars itself, originating from geological processes on the planet or even biological processes.",
              "A second possibility is that it was delivered from exogenous sources, like meteorites, comets or interplanetary dust particles floating through space.",
              "Organic compounds have been detected previously in all of these exogenous sources, and if they fell to the surface of Mars they could undergo reactions that would make them stable enough to build up in the martian regolith.",
              "The definitive discovery of organic molecules on Mars provides important context for life\u2019s potential on the planet, and locations where habitable environments may have persisted in the past.",
              "These molecules are critical to the origin of life as we know it, and provide clues as to whether or not life could have found a foothold on Mars.",
              "They can also help scientists understand what types of signatures future missions could look for in order to identify signs of past or present life.",
              "These measurements represent the first detection on Mars of indigenous organic compounds in surface rocks and address a long standing objective of the Mars exploration program.",

              "Burps of Methane on Mars The second big discovery from Curiosity was the detection of elevated methane levels in the atmosphere local to Gale Crater.",
              "Curiosity wasn\u2019t the first mission to get a whiff of martian methane.",
              "Earth-based telescopes and orbital missions at Mars had detected the organic chemical in the past.",
              "However, when Curiosity first stretched its wheels at Gale Crater, the rover found only a small fraction of methane in the atmosphere.",
              "This raised questions about where and how methane signals could be detected on Mars.",
              "Then came the 2014 announcement.",
              "The results presented in 2014 showed a ten-fold increase in methane levels local to the Gale Crater site.",
              "It was a large increase over previous measurements, but it was also short-lived.",
              "The methane signal dropped down to low levels shortly after it appeared.",
              "The methane cannot be taken as a sign of biology because there are plenty of non-biological sources that could have produced it, such as interactions between water and rocks.",
              "However, no matter where it came from, the sharp spike in methane could mean that its source is localized to a specific area.",
              "At first, scientists questioned whether or not the methane spike could have been caused by contamination released from Curiosity itself.",
              "That was the first question the research team had to address.",
              "\u201cI cannot find any logical argument to convince me that the methane detected by SAM was leaking from the rover,\u201d said Sushil Atreya, a co-author on the study and professor of Climate and Space Sciences and Director of the Planetary Science Laboratory at the University of Michigan.",
              "\u201cFirst, the rover itself does not generate methane.",
              "As for any methane that went to Mars with the rover from Earth, there was ample time for it to dissipate.",
              "Multiple observations made under different rover orientations and wind fields throughout the year, and before the methane spikes appeared, showed only a low background level of methane.",
              "\u201d If methane had been trapped somewhere in the rover, the likelihood of it remaining trapped for so long without dissipating is low.",
              "Keep in mind that the rover had been driving around the surface since 2012.",
              "In addition, methane returned to the same low background level after the spikes were detected (2).",
              "\u201cIf the rover were leaking methane into the instrument, it would have shown up at other times also, rather than just when the spikes were detected,\u201d added Atreya.",
              "Curiosity used an instrument called the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) to detect the methane spikes.",
              "There is some methane contained in the foreoptics of the TLS, but the amount is miniscule compared to the amount detected in the spikes.",
              "\u201cA conservative estimate is that one thousand times more methane is required to produce a 10-meter diameter cloud 7 ppbv methane around the rover than the entire amount of methane in the foreoptics, not even accounting for the fact that the cloud would need to be replenished continually over the two-month period of the spikes as methane dissipates away,\u201d added Atreya.",
              "\u201cIn view of the above, I\u2019m confident Curiosity is detecting martian methane at all times, not terrestrial methane hanging around the rover nor methane leaking into or out of the instrument.",
              "\u201d One possible source of the low levels of methane observed by Curiosity could be the breakdown of organics at the surface.",
              "As mentioned, organic molecules can originate from sources beyond Mars, such as cosmic dust or meteorites.",
              "After being delivered to the surface of the planet, the organics are exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun and are eventually broken down over time.",
              "\u201cGeology and biology are still the most plausible origins of the methane observed by Curiosity on Mars,\u201d said Atreya.",
              "\u201cAlthough, UV degradation of surface organics delivered by exogenous sources may be sufficient for the low background level of methane, geologic and biotic contributions are not ruled out.",

              "In order to go back in time and see how the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in Martian water changed over time, researchers can look at the ratio in water in the current atmosphere and water trapped in rocks at different times in the planet\u2019s history.",

              "[6] Juno entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5, 2016, UTC,[4][7] to begin a scientific investigation of the planet.",
              "[8] After completing its mission, Juno will be intentionally deorbited into Jupiter's atmosphere.",
              "[8] Juno's mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, gravitational field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere.",
              "It will also search for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere, mass distribution, and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 620 km/h (390 mph).",
              "[9] Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear powered Galileo orbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003.",
              "[8] Unlike all earlier spacecraft sent to the outer planets,[8] Juno is powered by solar panels, commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System, whereas radioisotope thermoelectric generators are commonly used for missions to the outer Solar System and beyond.",
              "For Juno, however, the three largest solar panel wings ever deployed on a planetary probe (at the time of launching) play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft as well as generating power.",
              "[10] Juno's name comes from Greek and Roman mythology.",
              "The god Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief, and his wife, the goddess Juno, was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature.",

              "The spacecraft's current name is in reference to the Roman goddess Juno.",
              "[11] Juno is sometimes called the New Frontiers 2 as the second mission in the New Frontiers program,[14][15] but is not to be confused with New Horizons 2, a proposed but unselected New Frontiers mission.",
              "Juno was selected on June 9, 2005, as the next New Frontiers mission after New Horizons.",
              "[16] The desire for a Jupiter probe was strong in the years prior to this, but there had not been any approved missions.",
              "[17][18] The Discovery Program had passed over the somewhat similar but more limited Interior Structure and Internal Dynamical Evolution of Jupiter (INSIDE Jupiter) proposal,[18] and the turn-of-the-century era Europa Orbiter was canceled in 2002.",
              "[17] The flagship-level Europa Jupiter System Mission was in the works in the early 2000s, but funding issues resulted in it evolving into ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer.",

              "[21] The spacecraft performed an orbit insertion burn to slow it enough to allow capture.",
              "It was expected to make three 53-day orbits before performing another burn on December 11, 2016, that would bring it into a 14-day polar orbit called the Science Orbit.",
              "Because of a suspected problem in Juno's main engine, the burn scheduled on December 11, 2016, was cancelled and Juno remained in its 53-day orbit until the first Ganymede encounter of its Extended Mission.",
              "[22] This extended mission began with a flyby of Ganymede on June 7, 2021.",

              "The probe is spun to ensure stability during the voyage and so that all instruments on the probe are able to observe Jupiter.",
              "[27][29] The voyage to Jupiter took five years, and included two orbital maneuvers in August and September 2012 and a flyby of the Earth on October 9, 2013.",
              "[30][31] When it reached the Jovian system, Juno had traveled approximately 19 astronomical units (2.",
              "8 billion kilometres).",
              "[32] Atlas V on launch pad Lift-off Launch video After traveling for about a year in an elliptical heliocentric orbit, Juno fired its engine twice in 2012 near aphelion (beyond the orbit of Mars) to change its orbit and return to pass by the Earth at a distance of 559 kilometers in October 2013.",
              "[30] It used Earth's gravity to help slingshot itself toward the Jovian system in a maneuver called a gravity assist.",
              "[34] The spacecraft received a boost in speed of more than 3.",
              "9 km/s (8,700 mph), and it was set on a course to Jupiter.",
              "[34][35][36] The flyby was also used as a rehearsal for the Juno science team to test some instruments and practice certain procedures before the arrival at Jupiter.",
              "[34][37] Jupiter's gravity accelerated the approaching spacecraft to around 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph).",
              "[38] On July 5, 2016, between 03:18 and 03:53 UTC Earth-received time, an insertion burn lasting 2,102 seconds decelerated Juno by 542 m/s (1,780 ft/s)[39] and changed its trajectory from a hyperbolic flyby to an elliptical, polar orbit with a period of about 53.",

              "0\u00d710^6 mi), far beyond Callisto's orbit.",
              "An eccentricity-reducing burn, called the Period Reduction Maneuver, was planned that would drop the probe into a much shorter 14 day science orbit.",
              "[41] Originally, Juno was expected to complete 37 orbits over 20 months before the end of its mission.",
              "Due to problems with helium valves that are important during main engine burns, mission managers announced on February 17, 2017, that Juno would remain in its original 53-day orbit, since the chance of an engine misfire putting the spacecraft into a bad orbit was too high.",
              "[22] Juno completed only 12 science orbits before the end of its budgeted mission plan, ending July 2018.",
              "[42] In June 2018, NASA extended the mission through July 2021, as described below.",
              "The orbits were carefully planned in order to minimize contact with Jupiter's dense radiation belts, which can damage spacecraft electronics and solar panels, by exploiting a gap in the radiation envelope near the planet, passing through a region of minimal radiation.",
              "[8][43] The \"Juno Radiation Vault\", with 1-centimeter-thick titanium walls, also aids in protecting Juno's electronics.",
              "[44] Despite the intense radiation, JunoCam and the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) are expected to endure at least eight orbits, while the Microwave Radiometer (MWR) should endure at least eleven orbits.",
              "[45] Juno will receive much lower levels of radiation in its polar orbit than the Galileo orbiter received in its equatorial orbit.",
              "Galileo's subsystems were damaged by radiation during its mission, including an LED in its data recording system.",
              "[46] The spacecraft completed its first flyby of Jupiter (perijove 1) on August 26, 2016, and captured the first images of the planet's north pole.",
              "[47] On October 14, 2016, days prior to perijove 2 and the planned Period Reduction Maneuver, telemetry showed that some of Juno's helium valves were not opening properly.",
              "[48] On October 18, 2016, some 13 hours before its second close approach to Jupiter, Juno entered into safe mode, an operational mode engaged when its onboard computer encounters unexpected conditions.",
              "The spacecraft powered down all non-critical systems and reoriented itself to face the Sun to gather the most power.",
              "Due to this, no science operations were conducted during perijove 2.",
              "[49] On December 11, 2016, the spacecraft completed perijove 3, with all but one instrument operating and returning data.",

              "[22] In June 2018, NASA extended the mission operations plan to July 2021.",
              "[53] During the mission, the spacecraft will be exposed to high levels of radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere, which may cause future failure of certain instruments and risk collision with Jupiter's moons.",
              "[54][55] In January 2021, NASA extended the mission operations to September 2025.",

              "[43] By 1993 it was evident that the ambitious sample return mission was infeasible with the existing ESA budget, so the mission was redesigned and subsequently approved by the ESA, with the final flight plan resembling the cancelled CRAF mission: an asteroid flyby followed by a comet rendezvous with in-situ examination, including a lander.",
              "[43] After the spacecraft launch, Gerhard Schwehm was named mission manager;",

              "[61] In May 2003, a new plan was formed to target the comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko, with a revised launch date of 26 February 2004 and comet rendezvous in 2014.",
              "[62][63] The larger mass and the resulting increased impact velocity made modification of the landing gear necessary.",
              "[64] After two scrubbed launch attempts, Rosetta was launched on 2 March 2004 at 07:17 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, using Ariane 5 G+ carrier rocket.",

              "Information gathered by the onboard cameras beginning at a distance of 24 million kilometres (15,000,000 mi) were processed at ESA's Operation Centre to refine the position of the comet in its orbit to a few kilometres.",
              "[citation needed] The first Earth flyby was on 4 March 2005.",
              "[67] On 25 February 2007, the craft was scheduled for a low-altitude flyby of Mars, to correct the trajectory.",
              "This was not without risk, as the estimated altitude of the flyby was a mere 250 kilometres (160 mi).",
              "[68] During that encounter, the solar panels could not be used since the craft was in the planet's shadow, where it would not receive any solar light for 15 minutes, causing a dangerous shortage of power.",
              "The craft was therefore put into standby mode, with no possibility to communicate, flying on batteries that were originally not designed for this task.",
              "[69] This Mars manoeuvre was therefore nicknamed \"The Billion Euro Gamble\".",
              "[70] The flyby was successful, with Rosetta even returning detailed images of the surface and atmosphere of the planet, and the mission continued as planned.",
              "[11][30] The second Earth flyby was on 13 November 2007 at a distance of 5,700 km (3,500 mi).",
              "[71][72] In observations made on 7 and 8 November, Rosetta was briefly mistaken for a near-Earth asteroid about 20 m (66 ft) in diameter by an astronomer of the Catalina Sky Survey and was given the provisional designation 2007 VN84.",
              "[73] Calculations showed that it would pass very close to Earth, which led to speculation that it could impact Earth.",
              "[74] However, astronomer Denis Denisenko recognised that the trajectory matched that of Rosetta, which the Minor Planet Center confirmed in an editorial release on 9 November.",
              "[75][76] The spacecraft performed a close flyby of asteroid 2867 S\u030cteins on 5 September 2008.",
              "Its onboard cameras were used to fine-tune the trajectory, achieving a minimum separation of less than 800 km (500 mi).",

              "[77] Rosetta's third and final flyby of Earth happened on 12 November 2009 at a distance of 2,481 km (1,542 mi).",
              "[78] On 10 July 2010, Rosetta flew by 21 Lutetia, a large main-belt asteroid, at a minimum distance of 3,168\u00b17.",
              "5 km (1,969\u00b14.",

              "3 mi/s).",
              "[13] The flyby provided images of up to 60 metres (200 ft) per pixel resolution and covered about 50% of the surface, mostly in the northern hemisphere.",
              "[32][79] The 462 images were obtained in 21 narrow- and broad-band filters extending from 0.",
              "24 to 1 \u03bcm.",
              "[32] Lutetia was also observed by the visible\u2013near-infrared imaging spectrometer VIRTIS, and measurements of the magnetic field and plasma environment were taken as well.",
              "[32][79] After leaving its hibernation mode in January 2014 and getting closer to the comet, Rosetta began a series of eight burns in May 2014.",
              "These reduced the relative velocity between the spacecraft and 67P from 775 to 7.",
              "9 m/s (2,543 to 26 ft/s).",
              "[21] In 2006, Rosetta suffered a leak in its reaction control system (RCS).",
              "[14] The system, which consists of 24 bipropellant 10-newton thrusters,[21] was responsible for fine tuning the trajectory of Rosetta throughout its journey.",
              "The RCS operated at a lower pressure than designed due to the leak.",
              "While this may have caused the propellants to mix incompletely and burn 'dirtier' and less efficiently, ESA engineers were confident that the spacecraft would have sufficient fuel reserves to allow for the successful completion of the mission.",
              "[80] Prior to Rosetta's deep space hibernation period, two of the spacecraft's four reaction wheels began exhibiting increased levels of \"bearing friction noise\".",
              "Increased friction levels in Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) B were noted after its September 2008 encounter with asteroid S\u030cteins.",
              "Two attempts were made to relubricate the RWA using an on-board oil reservoir, but in each case noise levels were only temporarily lowered, and the RWA was turned off in mid-2010 after the flyby of asteroid Lutetia to avoid possible failure.",
              "Shortly after this, RWA C also began showing evidence of elevated friction.",
              "Relubrication was also performed on this RWA, and methods were found to temporarily increase its operating temperature to better improve the transfer of oil from its reservoir.",
              "In addition, the reaction wheel's speed range was decreased to limit lifetime accumulated rotations.",
              "These changes resulted in RWA C's performance stabilising.",
              "[81] During the spacecraft's Deep Space Hibernation flight phase, engineers performed ground testing on a flight spare RWA at the European Space Operations Centre.",
              "After Rosetta exited hibernation in January 2014, lessons learned from the ground testing were applied to all four RWAs, such as increasing their operating temperatures and limiting their wheel speeds to below 1000 rpm.",
              "After these fixes, the RWAs showed nearly identical performance data.",
              "[81] Three RWAs were kept operational, while one of the malfunctioning RWAs was held in reserve.",
              "Additionally, new on-board software was developed to allow Rosetta to operate with only two active RWAs if necessary.",
              "[14][82] These changes allowed the four RWAs to operate throughout Rosetta's mission at 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko despite occasional anomalies in their friction plots and a heavy workload imposed by numerous orbital changes.",
              "[81] In August 2014, Rosetta rendezvoused with the comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko (67P) and commenced a series of manoeuvres that took it on two successive triangular paths, averaging 100 and 50 kilometres (62 and 31 mi) from the nucleus, whose segments are hyperbolic escape trajectories alternating with thruster burns.",
              "[22][20] After closing to within about 30 km (19 mi) from the comet on 10 September, the spacecraft entered actual orbit about it.",
              "[22][20][23][needs update] The surface layout of 67P was unknown before Rosetta's arrival.",
              "The orbiter mapped the comet in anticipation of detaching its lander.",

              "[15][88] Confirmation of contact with 67P reached Earth at 16:03 UTC.",
              "[89] On contact with the surface, two harpoons were to be fired into the comet to prevent the lander from bouncing off, as the comet's escape velocity is only around 1 m/s (3.",

              "The mysterious object 'Oumuamua, which was spotted zooming through the inner solar system in October 2017, is probably a fragment of a larger body that was torn apart by gravitational forces during a close flyby of its native star, a new study suggests.",
              "This \"tidal fragmentation scenario not only provides a way to form one single 'Oumuamua but also accounts for the vast population of asteroid-like interstellar objects,\" lead author Yun Zhang, of the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said in a statement.",

              "In addition, 'Oumuamua displayed \"non-gravitational acceleration\" during its trek through our neighborhood \u2014 motion that can't be attributed to tugs by the sun, Jupiter or other big bodies.",
              "Such motion can be caused by cometary outgassing, which pushes an object this way and that like thrusters on a spacecraft.",
              "But 'Oumuamua displayed no signs of outgassing \u2014 no visible tail or coma \u2014 even though most astronomers thought the interloper was likely to be a comet.",

              "This modeling work revealed that very close encounters can rip these bodies into elongated fragments, which are then ejected into interstellar space.",
              "Extreme heating during the flyby and the cooling that follows it causes these fragments to develop a surface crust, which helps support and maintain their odd shape, the results further indicate.",

              "ALMA for 14 September, 2020 / Read time: 10 minutes An international team of astronomers announced the discovery of a rare molecule, phosphine, in the clouds of Venus.",
              "On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments.",
              "Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes, floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity.",
              "The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial \u201caerial\u201d life.",
              "\u201cWhen we got the first hints of phosphine in Venus\u2019s spectrum, it was a shock!",
              "\u201d, says team leader Jane Greaves of Cardiff University in the UK, who first spotted signs of phosphine in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai.",
              "Confirming their discovery required using 45 antennas of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, a more sensitive telescope.",
              "Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimeter, much longer than the human eye can see, only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.",
              "The international team, which includes researchers from the UK, US and Japan, estimates that phosphine exists in Venus\u2019s clouds at a small concentration, only about twenty molecules in every billion.",
              "Following their observations, they ran calculations to see whether these amounts could come from natural non-biological processes on the planet.",
              "Some ideas included sunlight, minerals blown upwards from the surface, volcanoes, or lightning, but none of these could make anywhere near enough of it.",
              "These non-biological sources were found to make at most one ten thousandth of the amount of phosphine that the telescopes saw.",
              "To create the observed quantity of phosphine (which consists of hydrogen and phosphorus) on Venus, terrestrial organisms would only need to work at about 10% of their maximum productivity, according to the team.",
              "Earth bacteria are known to make phosphine: they take up phosphate from minerals or biological material, add hydrogen, and ultimately expel phosphine.",
              "Any organisms on Venus will probably be very different to their Earth cousins, but they too could be the source of phosphine in the atmosphere.",
              "While the discovery of phosphine in Venus\u2019s clouds came as a surprise, the researchers are confident in their detection.",
              "\u201cTo our great relief, the conditions were good at ALMA for follow-up observations while Venus was at a suitable angle to Earth.",
              "Processing the data was tricky, though, as ALMA isn\u2019t usually looking for very subtle effects in very bright objects like Venus,\u201d says team member Anita Richards of the UK ALMA Regional Centre and the University of Manchester.",
              "\u201cIn the end, we found that both observatories had seen the same thing \u2014 faint absorption at the right wavelength to be phosphine gas, where the molecules are backlit by the warmer clouds below,\u201d adds Greaves, who led the study published in Nature Astronomy.",
              "Another team member, Clara Sousa Silva of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, has investigated phosphine as a \u201cbiosignature\u201d gas of non-oxygen-using life on planets around other stars, because normal chemistry makes so little of it.",
              "She comments: \u201cFinding phosphine on Venus was an unexpected bonus!",
              "The discovery raises many questions, such as how any organisms could survive.",
              "On Earth, some microbes can cope with up to about 5% of acid in their environment \u2014 but the clouds of Venus are almost entirely made of acid.",
              "\u201d The team believes their discovery is significant because they can rule out many alternative ways to make phosphine, but they acknowledge that confirming the presence of \u201clife\u201d needs a lot more work.",
              "Although the high clouds of Venus have temperatures up to a pleasant 30 degrees Celsius, they are incredibly acidic \u2014 around 90% sulphuric acid \u2014 posing major issues for any microbes trying to survive there.",
              "ALMA European Operations Manager at ESO Leonardo Testi, who did not participate in the new study, says: \u201cThe non-biological production of phosphine on Venus is excluded by our current understanding of phosphine chemistry in rocky planets' atmospheres.",
              "Confirming the existence of life on Venus's atmosphere would be a major breakthrough for astrobiology;",
              "thus, it is essential to follow-up on this exciting result with theoretical and observational studies to exclude the possibility that phosphine on rocky planets may also have a chemical origin different than on Earth.",
              "\u201d More observations of Venus and of rocky planets outside our Solar System, including with ESO\u2019s forthcoming Extremely Large Telescope, may help gather clues on how phosphine can originate on them and contribute to the search for signs of life beyond Earth.",
              "### Edit (17 November 2020): Since this press release was published, the Nature Astronomy study and its associated data have been the subject of lively scientific discussion and scrutiny, with some teams publishing studies that cast doubt on the phosphine detection.",
              "As part of the scrutiny, ALMA staff identified an issue in the ALMA data used to confirm this detection.",
