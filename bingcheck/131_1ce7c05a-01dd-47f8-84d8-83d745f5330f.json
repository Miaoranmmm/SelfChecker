    "response": "That's a very interesting question. There have been many amazing archaeological discoveries in the last decade that have shed new light on human history. According to some sources[^1^] [^2^] [^4^] [^5^], some of the most significant ones are:\n\n- The Lovers of Valdaro: Two skeletons from over 6,000 years ago were excavated near Mantua, Italy, discovered in an embrace. They are believed to be a Neolithic couple who died young and were buried together[^5^].\n- The Nesting Pyramids of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1: A series of three pyramids nested inside each other were revealed by using electrical resistivity tomography at the ancient Maya city of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in Mexico. The innermost pyramid dates back to the 6th century CE, while the outermost one was built in the 9th century CE[^5^].\n- The Youngest Known Mummy: A tiny coffin containing a mummified fetus was found in a tomb near King Tutankhamun's burial chamber in Egypt. The fetus was about 18 weeks old and may have been a miscarried child of the young pharaoh[^5^].\n- New Dead Sea Scrolls: Fragments of ancient biblical texts dating back to the 2nd century BCE were discovered in a cave in the Judean Desert in Israel. The scrolls contain passages from the books of Zechariah and Nahum and are written in Greek and Hebrew[^5^].\n- Greece\u2019s Largest Tomb: A massive tomb complex dating back to the 4th century BCE was unearthed near Amphipolis in northern Greece. The tomb is decorated with elaborate sculptures and mosaic floors and may have belonged to a close associate of Alexander the Great[^5^].\n- The Lost City of Tenea: The remains of an ancient city that was founded by Trojan captives after the Trojan War were discovered near Chiliomodi in modern-day Greece. The city was mentioned in several ancient texts, but its location was unknown until 2018. The excavations revealed stone walls, buildings, marble floors, coins, pottery, and burials dating back to Roman and Hellenistic times[^2^].\n- The Nearly Perfectly-Preserved Nodosaur: A fossil of a nodosaur dinosaur that was so well preserved that it still had its skin, scales, and stomach contents was found in a mine in Alberta, Canada. The nodosaur was a heavily-armored herbivore that lived 110 million years ago and was about 18 feet long and weighed 3,000 pounds[^2^].\n- The Pyramid Construction Ramp at Hatnub: A 4,500-year-old ramp that may have been used to build the Great Pyramid of Giza was discovered at an alabaster quarry at Hatnub in Egypt. The ramp had staircases on either side and post holes that would have been used to pull a sled carrying heavy stones up steep slopes[^2^].\n- A Lost Civilization in Honduras: A team of explorers and archaeologists found evidence of a previously unknown civilization in a remote region of Honduras known as La Mosquitia. The team used lidar technology to map the dense jungle and revealed traces of plazas, pyramids, roads, canals, and sculptures that belonged to a culture that thrived between 1000 and 1500 CE[^2^].\n- The World's Oldest Figurative Artwork: A painting of an animal that resembles a wild pig or buffalo was found on the wall of a cave in Sulawesi, Indonesia. The painting was dated to at least 43,900 years old and is considered to be the oldest known figurative artwork in the world[^2^].\n\nThese discoveries have changed our understanding of human history by revealing new aspects of ancient cultures, civilizations, art, technology, religion, and biology. They have also raised new questions and challenges for future research.",

              "D.",
              "By then, it was already one of the largest cities in the Mayan world, covering nearly two square miles with densely packed commercial, residential and other structures made of stone.",

              "Remarkably, given the relatively simple technology available at the time, Chichen Itza was built in an area of rough terrain that was leveled in order to accommodate larger structures, including, most notably, El Castillo (\u201cthe castle\u201d), a pyramid structure that, thanks to restoration efforts on the part of the Mexican government, still stands today.",
              "Another larger structure on the site, Las Monjas, which served as a government building, was also built on leveled terrain.",

              "Researchers found that the human remains had bone marks and other wounds indicating that they were killed before being thrown into the cenote.",
              "By the ninth century, Chichen Itza was a de facto regional capital, with its rulers controlling much of the central and northern Yucatan peninsula.",
              "Via its port at Isla Cerritos on the northern coast, Chichen Itza became an important commercial center, trading in goods\u2014including gold and other treasures\u2014with other cities throughout the Americas.",
              "At its height, it is believed that as many as 50,000 people lived in the city.",
              "This population may have also been fairly diverse, at least by standards of the time, with residents immigrating to the city from beyond the Yucatan, including from present-day Central America.",
              "Although the fall of Mayan civilization is widely attributed to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, and the European colonialists that followed the famous explorer, Chichen Itza may well have lost its place as an important city in the region long before then.",
              "Indeed, historians believe that many of the political and economic activities of the city had shifted to Mayapan, a newer community built to the south and west of Chichen Itza, by the mid-1200s.",
              "There is some evidence that Chichen Itza may have been raided and looted at this time, although that remains up for debate.",
              "Still, when Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1526, there was a thriving community living in and around the city.",

              "MOHAMED EL-SHAHED/AFP via Getty Images By Bruce Bower November 2, 2022 at 7:00 am One hundred years ago, archaeologist Howard Carter stumbled across the tomb of ancient Egypt\u2019s King Tutankhamun.",
              "Carter\u2019s life was never the same.",
              "Neither was the young pharaoh\u2019s afterlife.",
              "Newspapers around the world immediately ran stories about Carter\u2019s discovery of a long-lost pharaoh\u2019s grave and the wonders it might contain, propelling the abrasive Englishman to worldwide acclaim.",
              "A boy king once consigned to ancient obscurity became the most famous of pharaohs (SN: 12/18/76).",
              "It all started on November 4, 1922, when excavators led by Carter discovered a step cut into the valley floor of a largely unexplored part of Egypt\u2019s Valley of the Kings.",
              "By November 23, the team had uncovered stairs leading down to a door.",
              "A hieroglyphic seal on the door identified what lay beyond: King Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb.",
              "Tutankhamun assumed power around 1334 B.",
              "C.",
              ", when he was about 10 years old.",
              "His reign lasted nearly a decade until his untimely demise.",
              "Although a minor figure among Egyptian pharaohs, Tutankhamun is one of the few whose richly appointed burial place was found largely intact.",
              "An unusually meticulous excavator for his time, Carter organized a 10-year project to document, conserve and remove more than 6,000 items from Tutankhamun\u2019s four-chambered tomb.",
              "While some objects, like Tut\u2019s gold burial mask, are now iconic, many have been in storage and out of sight for decades.",
              "But that\u2019s about to change.",
              "About 5,400 of Tutankhamun\u2019s well-preserved tomb furnishings are slated to soon go on display when the new Grand Egyptian Museum, near the Pyramids of Giza, opens.",
              "\u201cThe [Tut] burial hoard is something very unique,\u201d Shirin Frangoul-Bru\u0308ckner, managing director of Atelier Bru\u0308ckner in Stuttgart, Germany, the firm that designed the museum\u2019s Tutankhamun Gallery, said in an interview released by her company.",
              "Among other items, the exhibit will include the gold burial mask, musical instruments, hunting equipment, jewelry and six chariots.",
              "Even as more of Tut\u2019s story is poised to come to light, here are four things to know on the 100th anniversary of his tomb\u2019s discovery.",
              "Tutankhamun has a reputation as a fragile young man who limped on a clubfoot.",
              "Some researchers suspect a weakened immune system set him up for an early death.",
              "But \u201crecent research suggests it\u2019s wrong to portray Tut as a fragile pharaoh,\u201d says Egyptologist and mummy researcher Bob Brier, who is an expert on King Tut.",
              "His new book Tutankhamun and the Tomb That Changed the World chronicles how 100 years of research have shaped both Tut\u2019s story and archaeology itself.",
              "Clues from Tutankhamun\u2019s mummy and tomb items boost his physical standing, says Brier, of Long Island University in Brookville, N.",
              "Y.",
              "The young pharaoh might even have participated in warfare.",
              "Military chariots, leather armor and archery equipment buried with Tutankhamun show that he wanted to be viewed as a hunter and a warrior, Brier says.",
              "Inscribed blocks from Tutankhamun\u2019s temple, which were reused in later building projects before researchers identified them, portray the pharaoh leading charioteers in undated battles.",
              "If more blocks turn up showing battle scenes marked with dates, it would suggest Tutankhamun probably participated in those conflicts, Brier says.",
              "Pharaohs typically recorded dates of actual battles depicted in their temples, though inscribed scenes may have exaggerated their heroism.",
              "The frail story line has been built in part on the potential discovery of a deformity in Tut\u2019s left foot, along with 130 walking sticks found in his tomb.",
              "But ancient Egyptian officials were often depicted with walking sticks as signs of authority, not infirmity, Brier says.",
              "And researchers\u2019 opinions vary about whether images of Tut\u2019s bones reveal serious deformities.",
              "X-rays of the recovered mummy from the 1960s show no signs of a misshapen ankle that would have caused a limp.",
              "Neither did CT images examined in 2005 by the Egyptian Mummy Project, headed by Egyptologist and former Egyptian Minister of Antiquities Zahi Hawass.",
              "Then a 2009 reexamination of the CT images by the same researchers indicated that Tutankhamun had a left-foot deformity generally associated with walking on the ankle or the side of the foot, the team reported.",
              "The team\u2019s radiologist, Sahar Saleem of Egypt\u2019s Cairo University, says the CT images show that Tutankhamun experienced a mild left clubfoot, bone tissue death at the ends of two long bones that connect to the second and third left toes and a missing bone in the second left toe.",
              "Those foot problems would have \u201ccaused the king pain when he walked or pressed his weight on his foot, and the clubfoot must have caused limping,\u201d Saleem says.",
              "So a labored gait, rather than an appeal to royal authority, could explain the many walking sticks placed in Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb, she says.",
              "Brier, however, doubts that scenario.",
              "Tutankhamun\u2019s legs appear to be symmetrical in the CT images, he says, indicating that any left foot deformity was too mild to cause the pharaoh regularly to put excess weight on his right side while walking.",
              "Whether or not the boy king limped through life, the discovery and study of his mummy made it clear that he died around age 19, on the cusp of adulthood.",
              "Yet Tut\u2019s cause of death still proves elusive.",
              "In a 2010 analysis of DNA extracted from the pharaoh\u2019s mummy, Hawass and colleagues contended that malaria, as well as the tissue-destroying bone disorder cited by Saleem from the CT images, hastened Tutankhamun\u2019s death.",
              "But other researchers, including Brier, disagree with that conclusion.",
              "Further ancient DNA studies using powerful new tools for extracting and testing genetic material from the mummy could help solve that mystery.",
              "After Tutankhamun\u2019s death, ancient Egyptian officials did their best to erase historical references to him.",
              "His reign was rubbed out because his father, Akhenaten, was a \u201cheretic king\u201d who alienated his own people by banishing the worship of all Egyptian gods save for one.",
              "\u201cAkhenaten is the first monotheist recorded in history,\u201d Brier says.",
              "Ordinary Egyptians who had prayed to hundreds of gods suddenly could worship only Aten, a sun god formerly regarded as a minor deity.",
              "Meeting intense resistance to his banning of cherished religious practices, Akhenaten \u2014 who named himself after Aten \u2014 moved to an isolated city, Amarna, where he lived with his wife Nefertiti, six girls, one boy and around 20,000 followers.",
              "After Akhenaten died, residents of the desert outpost returned to their former homes.",
              "Egyptians reclaimed their old-time religion.",
              "Akhenaten\u2019s son, Tutankhaten \u2014 also originally named after Aten \u2014 became king, and his name was changed to Tutankhamun in honor of Amun, the most powerful of the Egyptian gods at the time.",
              "Later pharaohs omitted from written records any mentions of Akhenaten and Tutankhamun.",
              "Tut\u2019s tomb was treated just as dismissively.",
              "Huts of craftsmen working on the tomb of King Ramses VI nearly 200 years after Tut\u2019s death were built over the stairway leading down to Tutankhamun\u2019s nearby, far smaller tomb.",
              "Limestone chips from the construction littered the site.",
              "The huts remained in place until Carter showed up.",
              "While Carter found evidence that the boy king\u2019s tomb had been entered twice after it was sealed, whoever had broken in took no major objects.",
              "\u201cTutankhamun\u2019s ignominy and insignificance saved him\u201d from tomb robbers, says UCLA Egyptologist Kara Cooney.",
              "Pharaohs usually prepared their tombs over decades, building many rooms to hold treasures and extravagant coffins.",
              "Egyptian traditions required the placement of a mummified body in a tomb about 70 days after death.",
              "That amount of time may have allowed a mummy to dry out sufficiently while retaining enough moisture to fold the arms across the body inside a coffin, Brier suspects.",
              "Because Tutankhamun died prematurely, he had no time for extended tomb preparations.",
              "And the 70-day burial tradition gave craftsmen little time to finish crucial tomb items, many of which required a year or more to make.",
              "Those objects include a carved stone sarcophagus that encased three nested coffins, four shrines, hundreds of servant statues, a gold mask, chariots, jewelry, beds, chairs and an alabaster chest that contained four miniature gold coffins for Tutankhamun\u2019s internal organs removed during mummification.",
              "Evidence points to workers repurposing many objects from other people\u2019s tombs for Tutankhamun.",
              "Even then, time ran out.",
              "Consider the sarcophagus.",
              "Two of four goddesses on the stone container lack fully carved jewelry.",
              "Workers painted missing jewelry parts.",
              "Carved pillars on the sarcophagus are also unfinished.",
              "Tutankhamun\u2019s granite sarcophagus lid, a mismatch for the quartzite bottom, provides another clue to workers\u2019 frenzied efforts.",
              "Something must have happened to the original quartzite lid, so workers carved a new lid from available granite and painted it to look like quartzite, Brier says.",
              "Repairs on the new lid indicate that it broke in half during the carving process.",
              "\u201cTutankhamun was buried with a cracked, mismatched sarcophagus lid,\u201d Brier says.",
              "Tutankhamun\u2019s sarcophagus may originally have been made for Smenkare, a mysterious individual who some researchers identify as the boy king\u2019s half brother.",
              "Little is known about Smenkare, who possibly reigned for about a year after Akhenaten\u2019s death, just before Tutankhamun, Brier says.",
              "But Smenkare\u2019s tomb has not been found, leaving the sarcophagus puzzle unsolved.",
              "Objects including the young king\u2019s throne, three nested coffins and the shrine and tiny coffins for his internal organs also contain evidence of having originally belonged to someone else before being modified for reuse, says Harvard University archaeologist Peter Der Manuelian.",
              "Even Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb may not be what it appears.",
              "Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves of the University of Arizona Egyptian Expedition in Tucson has argued since 2015 that the boy king\u2019s burial place was intended for Nefertiti.",
              "He argues that Nefertiti briefly succeeded Akhenaten as Egypt\u2019s ruler and was the one given the title Smenkare.",
              "No one has found Nefertiti\u2019s tomb yet.",
              "But Reeves predicts that one wall of Tutankhamun\u2019s burial chamber blocks access to a larger tomb where Nefertiti lies.",
              "Painted scenes and writing on that wall depict Tutankhamun performing a ritual on Nefertiti\u2019s mummy, he asserts.",
              "And the gridded structure of those paintings was used by Egyptian artists years before Tutankhamun\u2019s burial but not at the time of his interment.",
              "But four of five remote sensing studies conducted inside Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb have found no evidence of a hidden tomb.",
              "Nefertiti, like Smenkare, remains a mystery.",
              "Carter\u2019s stunning discovery occurred as Egyptians were protesting British colonial rule and helped fuel that movement.",
              "Among the actions that enraged Egyptian officials: Carter and his financial backer, a wealthy British aristocrat named Lord Carnarvon, sold exclusive newspaper coverage of the excavation to The Times of London.",
              "Things got so bad that Egypt\u2019s government locked Carter out of the tomb for nearly a year, starting in early 1924.",
              "Egyptian nationalists wanted political independence \u2014 and an end to decades of foreign adventurers bringing ancient Egyptian finds back to their home countries.",
              "Tutankhamun\u2019s resurrected tomb pushed Egyptian authorities toward enacting laws and policies that helped to end the British colonial state and reduce the flow of antiquities out of Egypt, Brier says, though it took decades.",
              "Egypt became a nation totally independent of England in 1953.",
              "A 1983 law decreed that antiquities could no longer be taken out of Egypt (though those removed before 1983 are still legal to own and can be sold through auction houses).",
              "In 1922, however, Carter and Lord Carnarvon regarded many objects in Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb as theirs for the taking, Brier says.",
              "That was the way that Valley of the Kings excavations had worked for the previous 50 years, in a system that divided finds equally between Cairo\u2019s Egyptian Museum and an expedition\u2019s home institution.",
              "Taking personal mementos was also common.",
              "Evidence of Carter\u2019s casual pocketing of various artifacts while painstakingly clearing the boy king\u2019s tomb continues to emerge.",
              "\u201cCarter didn\u2019t sell what he took,\u201d Brier says.",
              "\u201cBut he felt he had a right to take certain items as the tomb\u2019s excavator.",
              "\u201d Recently recovered letters of English Egyptologist Alan Gardiner from the 1930s, described by Brier in his book, recount how Carter gave Gardiner several items from Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb, including an ornament used as a food offering for the dead.",
              "French Egyptologist Marc Gabolde of Paul-Vale\u0301ry Montpellier 3 University has tracked down beads, jewelry, a headdress fragment and other items taken from Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb by Carter and Carnarvon.",
              "Yet it is undeniable that one of Tutankhamun\u2019s greatest legacies, thanks to Carter, is the benchmark the excavation of his tomb set for future excavations, Brier says.",
              "Carter started his career as an artist who copied painted images on the walls of Egyptian tombs for excavators.",
              "He later learned excavation techniques in the field working with an eminent English Egyptologist, Flinders Petrie.",
              "Carter took tomb documentation to a new level, rounding up a crack team consisting of a photographer, a conservator, two draftsmen, an engineer and an authority on ancient Egyptian writing.",
              "Their decade-long effort also made possible the new Tutankhamun exhibition at the Grand Egyptian Museum.",
              "Now, not only museum visitors but also a new generation of researchers will have unprecedented access to the pharaoh\u2019s tomb trove.",
              "\u201cMost of Tutankhamun\u2019s [tomb] objects have been given little if any study beyond what Carter was able to do,\u201d says UCLA\u2019s Cooney.",

              "Digging layer by layer at the Saqqara site in Giza, moving earth one bucket at a time, archaeologists have found a giant trove of ancient coffins and mummies, along with ceramic amulets believed to have been used in burial rituals, and thick papyrus documents.",
              "Egyptologist Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former state minister for antiquities, told NBC News Wednesday that the site contained countless other artifacts relating to another pharaoh, King Teti, and his followers who worshipped him as a god for 1,000 years after his death.",
              "The remains of King Tutankhamun's closest generals and advisers were also at the site, which sits about 20 miles south of the North African nation's capital, he said.",
              "\u201cI really believe that this year and next year, this site is going to be the most important site in Egypt,\u201d said Hawass, referring to a network of underground rooms hidden 65 feet beneath the oldest pyramids in Egypt.",
              "\u201cI always say that we found until now only 30% of our monuments are still there, 70% are buried underneath the ground,\u201d he said.",
              "The discovery of so many new coffins in the region could be because \u201cTeti was worshipped as a god in the New Kingdom, and everyone wanted to be buried alongside him,\u201d Hawass said, adding that his team had found close to 300 coffins in the vicinity of his pyramid this year, most of them in good condition.",

              "After the mummies are exhumed from the site, archaeologists X-ray them to determine their ages at death, any diseases they might have carried in their lifetime, and what might have killed them.",
              "Teams then carry out a process of careful conservation and begin to record and archive newly uncovered antiquities.",
              "Hawass said the coffins and antiquities found at the site would likely be displayed in the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza, which is scheduled to open next year, although the project has stalled numerous times because of political instability and lack of government funding, according to the museum\u2019s website.",
              "Numerous objects associated with Tutankhamun are also set be displayed there, although the boy king\u2019s famous death mask and sarcophagus are still on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, in the interests of preserving tourism, Hawass said.",

              "Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb, discovered in 1922, is still the most intact pharaoh\u2019s tomb ever found.",
              "At the time, King Tut\u2019s exquisite artifacts and his elaborate burial shrine captivated the world and provided new insights about ancient Egypt.",
              "A century later the discovery still amazes and has had lasting influence on the field of archaeology as well as Egyptian national identity.",
              "(Graphic: See the enduring power of Tut as never before.)",

              "It had less to do with who he was when alive than with what happened after he died.",
              "Most important of all was when and how his tomb was found.",
              "Here are ten things to know about the discovery, why it was such a big deal at the time, and why it still matters today.",
              "The tomb of Tutankhamun was near the center of a crowded Pharaoh\u2019s graveyard called the Valley of the Kings, west of the city of Thebes.",
              "Unlike pyramid burials that announced the presence of great treasures, these tombs were often covered over to protect them from discovery by looters.",
              "Tut\u2019s tomb was eventually found under more than 150,000 tons of rocks, including debris from a tomb dug into the hillside above his.",
              "(How ancient Egyptians of all classes strived for eternal life.)",
              "The search for Tutankhamun was a true believer\u2019s quest.",
              "Experts of the day asserted that every tomb in the valley had either been raided in antiquity or uncovered more recently by archaeologists.",
              "An unimpressive site misidentified as Tut\u2019s tomb was among those that had been excavated.",
              "Tut also seemed to have been a minor pharaoh, with only a few artifacts in the surviving record bearing his name.",
              "Archaeologist Howard Carter went against the prevailing opinion and kept up the search.",
              "Carter dug for years, including during World War I, nearly losing the faith and funding of his English benefactor, the Earl of Carnarvon.",

              "The door the team excavated at the base of the stairs was sealed shut, but the tomb had been broken into twice.",

              "Ancient officials had patched the openings in the outer door with plaster and imprinted it with new seals after the last breach.",
              "An inner door down a sloping corridor had also been broken and re-sealed.",
              "In the first room Carter opened, called the antechamber, many precious items were arranged precariously, likely re-stacked in a hurry by officials restoring the tomb after the final robbery.",

              "Numbered cards were placed by individual artifacts in photos before any object was moved, and Carter took detailed notes and sketches before packing up the inventoried treasures.",
              "Nearly intact, the tomb provided unmatched insight into this moment in Egyptian history.",
              "Chariots, weapons, clothing, and artwork reflected methods of warfare and who Egypt saw as its enemies.",

              "Egyptian and Tutankhamun motifs appeared in popular music and fashion, architecture and de\u0301cor, and even in brands of fruit.",
              "Unlike many discoveries found in Egypt, Tut\u2019s treasures didn\u2019t leave the country.",
              "Lord Carnarvon had expected to claim a large share of the antiquities, as was customary for most excavations.",
              "In part because of Carter\u2019s irascible personality but largely because Egypt was asserting its independence from England at the time of the discovery, the government instead insisted that they all remain in Egypt.",
              "At the time of the discovery, Tut quickly became a symbol of Egyptian identity.",
              "Now the more than 5,000 treasures from Tut\u2019s tomb will be the centerpiece of a new Grand Egyptian Museum, and more and more Egyptians are directing archaeological work being done in the country.",
              "(Go inside Egypt's new billion-dollar museum, deemed fit for a pharaoh.)",
              "Tut was an influential pharaoh, restoring the importance of gods that his predecessor had dismissed, but he had a very short rule and did not feature prominently in the historical record.",

              "The first excavations at the mound in 1964 led to exposure of the perimeter wall, and further excavations in the 1970s uncovered many other ancient remains.",
              "[4] The inner tomb was first discovered in 2012 and entered in August 2014.",
              "[2] The quality and artistic merit of the tomb contents indicate it contained important people.",

              "Initial public speculation that, due to its size and cost of construction, it could be the tomb of Alexander the Great was dismissed by experts when commenting on the published findings, as the available historical records mention Alexandria in Egypt as the final resting place of Alexander's body.",
              "Nevertheless, due also to Alexander's associations with the city it is thought likely to be the tomb of a close relation (Alexander prepared for campaigns here against Thrace in 335 BC and the port was used as naval base during his campaigns in Asia.",

              "The fossil was unveiled after museum technician Mark Mitchell dedicated six years to painstakingly revealing the dinosaur\u2019s preserved skin and bones from the marine rock in which it was encased.",

              "But it lived off of plants and favored ferns, based on the contents of its stomach.",
              "The chunk resembling its stomach is about the size of a soccer ball.",
              "Shockingly lifelike dinosaur fossil makes public debut \u201cThe finding of the actual preserved stomach contents from a dinosaur is extraordinarily rare, and this stomach recovered from the mummified nodosaur by the museum team is by far the best-preserved dinosaur stomach ever found to date,\u201d said Jim Basinger, study coauthor and University of Saskatchewan geologist, in a statement.",
              "\u201cWhen people see this stunning fossil and are told that we know what its last meal was because its stomach was so well preserved inside the skeleton, it will almost bring the beast back to life for them, providing a glimpse of how the animal actually carried out its daily activities, where it lived, and what its preferred food was.",
              "\u201d Bad to the bone: Cannibal dinosaurs turned to eating each other in tough times This discovery sheds light on definitive evidence of what a large herbivorous dinosaur ate \u2014 in this case, a lot of chewed-up fern leaves, some stems and twigs.",
              "The details of the plants were so well preserved in the stomach that they could be compared to samples taken from modern plants today.",
              "\u201cWe could see the different layers of cells in a leaf fragment including the epidermis with the pores, called stomata, through which plants take in carbon dioxide,\u201d Greenwood said.",
              "\u201cWe could also see the surface patterning of the epidermis cells, which was like a jigsaw pattern that we see on many living ferns.",
              "\u201d This discovery changed what the researchers know about the diet of such large herbivores, and the plant material revealed more about the dinosaur\u2019s interactions with its environment.",
              "This nodosaur was picky.",
              "The researchers compared the contents of its stomach with fossil leaf studies from the same time period and region.",
              "The nodosaur specifically ate the soft leaves of certain ferns and largely neglected common cycad and conifer leaves.",
              "Overall, they found 48 microfossils of pollen and spores including moss and liverwort, 26 club mosses and ferns, two flowering plants and 13 conifers.",
              "The asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs hit at 'deadliest possible' angle \u201cThe lack of horsetails, and rarity of cycads and conifers is surprising, given that these are very common in the surrounding flora,\u201d said Caleb Marshall Brown, study author and curator of dinosaur systematics and evolution at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, in an email.",
              "\u201cEven within ferns, it looks like Borealopelta may have had a preference for certain types of ferns, while ignoring others.",
              "\u201d The preservation of the plant material in its stomach suggested that the dinosaur died and was buried soon after eating.",
              "Based on the growth rings and maturity of some of the plant material, the researchers were able to determine that the dinosaur\u2019s death likely occurred between late spring to mid-summer, Brown said.",
              "Then there\u2019s the matter of charcoal, which was also found in its stomach.",
              "That likely meant that it was grazing in an area hit by wildfires.",
              "The researchers know that forest fires were common in forests during the early Cretaceous period, 100 million to 145 million years ago.",
              "And after forest fires, ferns flourish low to the ground.",
              "\u201cWhen you think about it, this may actually make a lot of sense,\u201d Brown said.",
              "\u201cIf you are a nodosaur, you can only feed close to the ground.",
              "This new growth will also be more palatable and has a higher nutrient content than established growth [like conifers].",
              "As a result, many large mammal herbivores we are familiar with today will seek out recently burned areas in both grasslands and forests, as they provide unique feeding opportunities.",
              "\u201d Arctic dinosaur may have crossed between Asia and America to dominate the north Wildfires likely occurred in the area where the nodosaur was grazing in the previous six to 18 months, Greenwood said.",
              "That\u2019s enough time for lush ferns to pop up.",
              "\u201cThe discovery of charcoal together with a fern-filled stomach opens a window into the biology of this large herbivorous armoured dinosaur as it suggested Borealopelta was likely a keystone herbivore that shaped the landscape by its grazing, and that it also grazed on the ferns growing in open areas created by wildfires,\u201d Greenwood said.",
              "\u201cThat is so cool.",
              "\u201d Paleobotany, which is the study of plant fossils, provides insight that dinosaur skeletons simply can\u2019t, Greenwood said.",

              "It was published this week in the journal Royal Society Open Science.",
              "The fossil was discovered by accident in 2011 by Shawn Funk, a shovel operator at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray.",
              "Paleontologists from the Royal Tyrrell were called to have a look and realized at once that it was no ordinary fossil.",
              "While most fossils include only bones, this one included skin.",
              "It was so well-preserved that it has been described as \"mummified.\"",
              "In the dinosaur's belly, \"there were these massive concentrations of what looked like rocks,\" Brown said.",
              "Those were in a mass about the size of a soccer ball, and it appears they were gastroliths \u2014 rocks that some plant-eating dinosaurs use to grind up their food in their stomachs, as modern birds do, instead of using their teeth.",
              "Sure enough, when chunks of the mass were encased in resin, sliced and examined under the microscope, the researcher could see well-preserved twigs, leaves, mosses, pollen and spores.",
              "To get some help at identifying the plant material, the dinosaur researchers turned to paleobotanists, including Brandon University researcher David Greenwood and his team, along with their retired Royal Tyrrell colleague Dennis Braman.",
              "They discovered that the dinosaur was a bit of a picky eater.",
              "While it lumbered through a landscape that was lush with conifers, horsetails and cycads, there weren't a lot of those in its stomach.",
              "\"It's almost all ferns,\" Brown said, noting that ferns aren't actually very nutritious.",
              "\"It wasn't just hoovering up everything on the landscape.\"",
              "But to him, the biggest surprise was that the stomach also contained a significant amount of wood, mostly charcoal, suggesting it was feeding in an area that had recently been ravaged by wildfires.",
              "\"And that's a really cool result,\" Brown said.",
              "\"Because if you look at large mammals that are herbivores today, they often seek out areas that are recovering from forest fires.\"",
              "That's because the new growth tends to be lush, more nutritious than older plants, and low to the ground where it's easily accessible.",
              "By looking at the types of spores and the fact that the twigs appeared to be in the middle of their growing season, the researchers figured out that the animal died during the wet season, which was late spring or early summer.",
              "In Dinosaur Cold Case, a recent documentary about the fossil on CBC's Nature of Things, Greenwood said extreme storms and flash floods would have been a problem at that time of year on the coastal plain where the dinosaur lived and suggested that being swept away by rushing water may have been what caused its death.",
              "The discoveries about the nodosaur's last meal are significant because to date, Brown said, \"we know almost nothing about what herbivorous dinosaurs eat.\"",
              "Only guesses can be made based on what plants lived nearby and the dinosaur's teeth.",
              "There are also clues in fossil dinosaur feces, but the plant material in those are often digested beyond recognition and it's difficult to know which dinosaur they came from.",

              "Nine cases of possible dinosaur stomachs of plant-eating dinosaurs have been found, the researchers note, but most have turned out to just be plant material found nearby rather than actual stomachs.",
              "In this case, the dinosaur was washed far out to sea, without any plants from the landscape it lived in, before it was fossilized.",
              "\"So in this case we have what I would say is by far the best evidence that these are stomach contents,\" Brown said.",
              "That said, he notes that it may not necessarily be representative of what this species normally ate, as an animal's diet can vary depending on its age, its health, and the seasonal availability of different foods.",
              "Still, he said it's useful to be able to compare it to what scientists think plant-eating dinosaurs were eating at that time and raises new questions to investigate, such as: How much of this food a dinosaur this size would have needed to eat to sustain itself?",

          "Known as a nodosaur, this 110 million-year-old, armored plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found.",
          "The nodosaur lived 110 million years ago during the early Cretaceous, in a lush forest of conifers, ferns and palm-like plants called cycads, near the coast of what was then an inland sea.",
          "The finding of the actual preserved stomach contents from a dinosaur is extraordinarily rare, and this stomach recovered from the mummified nodosaur by the museum team is by far the best-preserved dinosaur stomach ever found to date,\u201d said Jim Basinger, study coauthor and University of Saskatchewan geologist, in a statement.",
          "The nodosaur, known as Borealopelta markmitchelli, was found in 2011 during mining operations north of Fort McMurray in Alberta, Canada.",
          "While most fossils include only bones, this one included skin.",
          "A dinosaur with impressive armored plates across its back became mummified around 110 million years ago after enjoying one last meal before dying."

          "The ramp system dates at least as far back as the reign of Pharaoh Khufu, who built the Great Pyramid at Giza.",
          "\u201cSince the newly-discovered ramp dates to the reign of Khufu, our research offers the exciting possibility for offering further insights into the logistics and technologies used in constructing that astonishing building,\u201d Dr. Enmarch said.",
          "The remains of the 4,500-year-old ramp were found at the site of Hatnub, Egypt.",
          "\"The study of the tool marks and the presence of two [of] Khufu's inscriptions led us to the conclusion that this system dates back at least to Khufu's reign, the builder of the Great Pyramid in Giza,\" he added.",
          "\u201cThis system is composed of a central ramp flanked by two staircases with numerous post holes,\u201d Yannis Gourdon, co-director of the joint mission at Hatnub, told Live Science.",
          "Along the sides of the ancient ramp are two staircases lined with postholes, to which ropes were likely tied thousands of years ago to drag the huge stone blocks.",
          "\"As this system dates back at least to Khufu's reign, that means that during the time of Khufu, ancient Egyptians knew how to move huge blocks of stone using very steep slopes."

          "Like a painted hunting scene from at least 43,900 years ago previously found in a separate Sulawesi cave (SN: 12/11/19), minimum age estimates for the pig paintings are based on measures of radioactive uranium\u2019s decay in cauliflower-like mineral growths that formed in thin layers over and underneath parts of the depictions.",
          "They found the calcite on a pig began forming at least 43,900 years ago, and the deposits on two buffalo were at least 40,900 years old.",
          "It\u2019s a painting of a warty pig, an animal still found on Sulawesi, that was rendered on the cave\u2019s back wall at least 45,500 years ago, researchers report January 13 in Science Advances.",
          "The previously oldest dated rock art painting was found by the same team in Sulawesi.",
          "The panel is almost five metres wide and appears to show a type of buffalo called an anoa, plus wild pigs found on Sulawesi.",
          "The authors say that, to their knowledge, the animal painting from Leang Tedongnge is the earliest known representational work of art in the world."
