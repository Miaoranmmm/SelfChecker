    "query": "What is the most significant development in renewable energy that has the potential to transform the way we generate and distribute energy, and how can this innovation be scaled up to promote sustainable energy on a global level?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. There are many developments in renewable energy that have the potential to transform the way we generate and distribute energy, but one of the most innovative and promising technologies is **floating solar panels**[^1^].\n\nFloating solar panels are solar panels mounted on platforms that float on bodies of water such as lakes, reservoirs, or the ocean. They have several advantages over traditional land-based solar panels, such as taking up less space on land, reducing water evaporation from reservoirs, and increasing efficiency due to water cooling[^1^].\n\nAccording to a report by McKinsey, floating solar panels could generate up to **10 percent** of the world's electricity by 2050, if deployed on only **3 percent** of the world's water surfaces[^2^]. This would be equivalent to **4,000 gigawatts** of installed capacity, which is more than the current global capacity of all renewable sources combined[^2^].\n\nTo scale up this innovation and promote sustainable energy on a global level, some of the challenges that need to be addressed are:\n\n- Developing standards and regulations for floating solar projects, especially in terms of environmental and social impacts, safety, and grid integration[^2^].\n- Reducing costs and improving performance of floating solar systems, especially in terms of durability, reliability, and maintenance[^2^].\n- Increasing awareness and acceptance of floating solar technology among stakeholders, such as policymakers, investors, utilities, and communities[^2^].\n\nBy overcoming these challenges, floating solar panels could become a game-changer for renewable energy and help achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.\ud83c\udf0e",

              "The areas suitable for wind and solar installations have attracted many interested parties, including small and medium-size renewables developers, large utilities, independent power producers, oil and gas majors, and financial players.",
              "In addition, other players, such as commercial and residential developers or agricultural companies, may be eyeing the same land.",
              "This wide range of interest has had the predictable effect of pushing land prices steadily upward over the past decade.",
              "Even though most wind and solar developments involve lease agreements, not land sales, ultimately these deals are driven by land prices.",
              "While countries such as France and Spain have experienced moderate price increases of 1 percent annually, land values in Germany and the United States soared nearly 10 percent annually between 2011 and 2020 (Exhibit 2).",
              "Furthermore, lease models can be complex: leasing rates can be tied to the surface area, installed capacity, energy generated, or even the revenue or profits generated by a project.",
              "This makes it difficult for developers to compare sites and evaluate their financial attractiveness early in the process.",
              "Finding attractive locations for wind or solar installations often means a consideration not only of the land itself but also of the process and time required to receive the permits to develop it.",

              "Although regulatorsa\u0302\u0080\u0099 standards for transparency and customer affordability continue to rise, these authorities often lack the staffing, capabilities, and tools to handle the permitting process efficiently.",
              "As a result, permitting can span up to ten years, from project start to permits granted.",
              "Onshore wind projects take the longest to gain approval, with developers in France and Italy experiencing the longest median duration: eight and seven years, respectively (Exhibit 3).",
              "This development and permitting process is also subject to delays that result from public opposition.",
              "Even when resistance does not prevent new solar and wind projects, it can cause significant complications.",
              "Lawsuits, for example, can delay processes by several years and create unforeseen cost increases.",
              "In response, some developers have increased the level of stakeholder engagement they pursue.",
              "This can include a range of options, such as active outreach, public hearings, municipal consultations, collaborative decision making with key stakeholders, and even the possibility of giving residents equity or other forms of financial participation in the project.",
              "Utility-scale solar or wind installations need more than land.",
              "They also need a large-scale grid infrastructure that will transport clean energy to end users.",
              "In many countries, the land most available and suitable for wind and solar development is not located near the dense population, commercial, and industrial centers that need the most electricity.",
              "This is particularly true in the United States, where significant power imbalances exist.",
              "Densely populated states such as California, Massachusetts, and New York have considerable power deficits (of ten to 40 gigawatt hours), while rural states such as North Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming have surpluses (of 30 to 40 gigawatt hours) (Exhibit 4).",
              "Building new transmission lines to connect rural areas to cities can also be a lengthy and expensive process, subject to its own set of challenges from landowners who dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t want power lines they dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t benefit from running along their property.",
              "Beyond transmission, grid congestion also arises from a lack of systemwide flexible assets (such as battery storage systems or pumped stored hydroelectricity) that help manage the significantly higher level of variability inherent to wind and solar energy.",
              "Because the stability of the power grid depends on predictability and a balance of supply and demand, the US grid is not always able to immediately integrate all new wind and solar power.",

              "Solar, storage, and onshore wind capacity could reach more than 1,240 gigawatts (GW) over the next decade, growing 2.",
              "7 times faster than projected before the IRA took effect (Exhibit 1).",
              "The IRA is expected to stimulate domestic manufacturing of modules, subcomponents, inverters, trackers, and more, which could alleviate material shortages that had previously restricted project installation.",
              "However, the solar industry faces significant construction and labor shortages that could worsen over the next three to five years.",
              "As solar projects grow in number and size, demand for engineering, procurement, and construction companies (EPCs) and for the labor and materials required to build projects is expected to increase rapidly.",
              "Based on McKinsey analysis, EPC capacity to serve utility-scale solar projects would have to almost triple to meet the anticipated demand of approximately 50 GW installed in 2027.",
              "These market dynamics produce strong incentives to rethink traditional industry practices and unlock more-efficient project delivery.",
              "The size of the prize for successful collaboration has never been bigger: US renewables could attract an estimated $700 to $800 billion in capital investments to build onshore wind and solar projects through 2030.",
              "To capture this value, solar project owners, developers, and EPCs should establish new approaches to partnerships, risk ownership and contracting, workforce development, and digital and technology adoption.",
              "The energy transition will depend on it.",
              "To stimulate solar project development, the IRA extends old incentives and provides new ones.",
              "Chief among them are the revamped Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which offers a 30 percent tax credit on solar project capital cost, and the alternative Production Tax Credit (PTC), worth an estimated 2.",
              "75 cents per kilowatt-hour produced.",

              "However, despite these incentives, the solar industry still faces five critical challenges: EPC and labor shortages, limited access to land and permits, inflation and commodity price volatility, interconnection costs and timelines, and supply chain constraints.",
              "These are the main bottlenecks that make it difficult to deliver projects at a competitive cost and schedule, and they could potentially limit the rate at which the United States is able to grow its renewables to meet the economic incentives in the IRA.",
              "Many of these challenges have been ongoing, but a recent McKinsey survey suggests that they have shifted in order of priority.",
              "5McKinsey Utility, Developer, and EPC Survey, December 2022.",
              "Today, EPC and labor shortages are a top challenge for renewables players, overtaking other obstacles such as limited access to land and permits, inflation and commodity price volatility, and interconnection (Exhibit 2).",
              "EPCs could remain in short supply for the next three to five years as the industry attempts to almost triple in size to build new utility-scale solar projects.",
              "This undersupplied market has given EPCs leverage to negotiate more favorable pricing and reduce their liability when materials or labor shortages cause schedule or cost overruns.",
              "At the same time, owners are struggling to secure EPC capacity and absorb risk from procurement uncertainty.",
              "Although some developers have established EPC partners, othersa\u0302\u0080\u0094such as utilities that are just beginning to self-develop renewablesa\u0302\u0080\u0094have arrived late to the matchmaking and need to catch up on solar-project-delivery capabilities.",
              "In this constricted environment, project pipelines are at stake, along with a seat at the table amid growing demand for renewables.",

              "And as project sizes grow, there is a shortage of EPCs that can achieve high productivity and deliver cost-efficient projects at greater scale.",
              "In the coming years, collaboration will be a major theme in renewables, achieved through new approaches to strategic partnerships, risk ownership and contracting, workforce development, and digital and technology adoption.",
              "Established EPCs and developers can form tighter partnerships, such as by facilitating more integration between their respective engineering teams or promoting transparency on pricing and risk.",
              "And those without committed partners might entertain new options;",
              "for example, a utility developer might invest in building the capabilities of a regional contractor to install solar at scale.",
              "Bold ambitions such as these could shift the market away from traditional contracting structures in which EPCs are treated purely as service providers that are compensated for delivering each project.",
              "Instead, owners and EPCs could pursue portfolio partnerships in which both sides have incentives to tackle supply chain and labor constraints together, unlocking additional value to be shared between them.",
              "Partnerships have been a winning strategy in the solar industry for many years.",
              "Today, leading developers have locked in capacity with two or three core EPC partners on average, bringing benefits to both sides (Exhibit 4).",
              "The idea of a partnership extends beyond simply establishing a select set of EPCs that bid on or are awarded work on a project-by-project basis.",
              "They can range from nonbinding relationship-based commitments to formal master service agreements with bilateral contractual commitments.",
              "All partnership arrangements share common objectives, such as increased visibility and joint planning of project pipelines, early engineering involvement and continuous improvement of designs, and collaborative workforce attraction and development programs. Forming partnerships will continue to be a winning strategy in solar project delivery, but the landscape of partnerships is expected to change going forward.",
              "First, the industry could shift to include a broader set of stakeholders vying for committed partners.",
              "Second, new approaches to joint business growth and capability building could deepen partnerships and promote collaboration across larger and longer-term project portfolios.",
              "Expanding the industry.",
              "Incumbents will expand their businesses to take advantage of IRA tailwinds, but rapid market growth also opens the door for other players to build a presence in renewables.",
              "For example, it has become potentially more attractive for regulated utilities to self-develop renewables, since they could not efficiently monetize the Solar Investment Tax Credit but can take full advantage of the alternative Solar Production Tax Credit created by the IRA.",
              "New types of EPCs could also enter renewables.",
              "A few large, diversified EPCs that serve other industries have begun expanding into solar.",
              "And as owners look for available talent pools to get projects in the ground, local or regional contractors could also be reskilled to install solar projects.",
              "Shifting to portfolio partnerships.",
              "Contracting across a larger pipeline of projects can create flexibility to reallocate labor and materials to the projects that are ready to go.",
              "Shifting from one-off projects to larger pipelines also helps align incentives for partners to support each othera\u0302\u0080\u0099s growth and productivity improvements over time.",
              "For example, to establish a multiyear solar portfolio, a utility developer might contract an EPC that currently serves the developera\u0302\u0080\u0099s other transmission assets but has ambitions to expand into renewables.",
              "The utility could procure equipment in-housea\u0302\u0080\u0094such as panels, inverters, trackers, and rackinga\u0302\u0080\u0094to manage long lead times and leverage economies of scale across multiple projects while the EPC focuses on building the labor and technical skills to install solar.",
              "Greater cost transparency could allow the utility to monitor efficiency gains over time and set realistic expectations for the first few projects.",
              "The project load could also ramp up in stages, allowing the EPC to streamline the installation process and implement learnings on future projects.",
              "Co-investing in growth and capability building.",
              "Players along the solar value chain can deepen partnerships through joint capability building and capacity expansion.",
              "For instance, a developer could co-invest with an EPC to build a workforce-training center to address the shortage of construction labor.",
              "The developer could use its community ties to assist with talent attraction, securing a skilled workforce to install its renewables projects.",
              "Meanwhile, the EPC could implement a training program that is compatible with the intended project pipeline and offer consistent, localized work to program graduates by collaborating with the developer on an efficient installation process and project sequencing.",
              "Joining forces with local government, unions, or a community trade school could also strengthen the partnership.",
              "EPC availability has become a tighter bottleneck on project pipelines, pushing owners to engage EPCs earlier, consider less-experienced players, and absorb greater pricing risk for labor and materials.",
              "Stakeholders, including the owner, developer, EPC, and suppliers, can shift their contracting approach to reduce disruptions to their agreements and promote more-efficient project delivery.",
              "These stakeholders can revisit the allocation of responsibilities and risk, as well as engaging in more collaborative contracting.",
              "Adapting to new responsibilities.",
              "The line between the responsibilities of the EPC and those of the developer is already blurring as some developers have shifted away from turnkey contracts.",
              "Our survey and interviews with industry experts indicate that an increasing number of owners are expanding in-house procurement capabilities over the next five years.",
              "Developers are already delivering projects with engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) and project management contractor (PMC) models that enable more owner oversight and control, and some utilities are expected to follow suit.",
              "Revisiting the allocation of risk.",
              "Risk ownership is another aspect of contracts that is ripe for revision.",
              "Recent contracts with EPCs have tended to shift more risk onto the project owner.",
              "However, instead of taking an adversarial approach to risk ownership, stakeholders can work together to align incentives so that both parties are mitigating risks that could lead to cost or schedule overruns.",
              "For example, project partners could set aside a common incentive pool that grows or shrinks based on overall project performance and negotiate allocation percentages as part of contracting.",
              "As suppliers or EPCs take on additional project risk, the project ownera\u0302\u0080\u0099s percentage would decrease to compensate them.",
              "In another model, the contractor that carries the risk for materials and labor could receive progressive incentive payments for achieving costs or schedule below a predefined target.",
              "In such progressive incentive schemes, the contractor retains a higher percentage of the cost savings as the total cost savings increase (for example, 30 percent of the first $100,000 in cost savings, 35 percent of the next $100,000, and so on).",
              "This system can motivate the contractor to exceed targets and capture incremental savings beyond the low-hanging fruit.",
              "Embracing collaborative contracting.",
              "Collaborative contracting could be a solution to anticipate demand, align on capacity for future projects, and unlock mutual growth.",
              "In other capital-intensive industries, collaborative contracting pilots have improved both costs and schedules by 15 to 20 percent versus traditional contracts, according to prior McKinsey research.",

              "The right level of collaboration will depend on the nature of the partnership.",
              "For example, in aligned-incentives arrangements, cost and schedule overruns and underruns are shared.",
