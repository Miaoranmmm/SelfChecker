    "query": "What is the history and significance behind the festival of Diwali, and how has it evolved over time to become a globally recognized and celebrated event?",
    "response": "Diwali is a festival of lights that celebrates the triumph of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. It is one of the most important festivals in Hinduism and is observed by people of various faiths across India and its diaspora[^2^].\n\nThe history of Diwali can be traced back to ancient India, when it most likely began as an important harvest festival that stretches back more than 2,500 years[^4^]. However, there are various legends associated with the origin of Diwali. Some believe it to be the celebration of the marriage of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, with Lord Vishnu[^3^] [^1^]. Others use it as a celebration of her birthday, as Lakshmi is said to have been born on the new-moon day of Kartik[^3^]. In Bengal, the festival is dedicated to the worship of Mother Kali, the dark goddess of strength[^3^]. Lord Ganesha\u2014the elephant-headed god and symbol of auspiciousness and wisdom\u2014is also worshiped in most Hindu homes on this day[^3^].\n\nDiwali is marked by four days of celebration, each with a different tradition and significance. The first day is Dhanteras, when people buy gold or silver items or new utensils for their homes. The second day is Naraka Chaturdasi, when people light diyas (clay lamps) and candles in their homes and gardens to symbolize the destruction of evil forces. The third day is the main day of Diwali, when people perform Lakshmi puja (worship of the goddess of wealth) and exchange gifts and sweets with their friends and relatives. The fourth day is Padwa or Balipratipada, when people celebrate the bond between husband and wife or between siblings. Some also celebrate the new year on this day[^2^] [^3^].\n\nDiwali has evolved over time to become a globally recognized and celebrated event. It is a time to spread joy, peace, and prosperity among people of different cultures and religions. It is also a time to reflect on one's inner light and overcome the darkness within oneself[^2^].",

              "[77] Throughout the epic, Rama's decisions were always in line with dharma (duty) and the Diwali festival serves as a reminder for followers of hinduism to maintain their dharma in day to day life.",

              "However, Kali can hardly be regarded as a Goddess of Bengal alone.",
              "In fact the form in which she is observed by most Bengalis is just one among the many facets that the deity is believed to have.",
              "As scholar of religious studies, June McDaniel notes, \u201cKali is a strange and mercurial figure\u201d.",
              "\u201cIn northwestern India she is thin and ugly, while in Bengal she is voluptuous with large eyes and full lips.",
              "In some areas of India she is a tribal and village Goddess who protects a group of people, or a geographical region, and an ancestress who grants the desires of her people,\u201d she writes in her article, \u2018Kali: Goddess of life, death and transcendence\u2019.",
              "She is also the yogic Goddess of death and transcendence and the Tantric deity who wears a necklace of skulls and belt of human hands and dances at the cremation ground.",
              "\u201cKali\u2019s present complexity of character developed slowly during the course of at least two thousand years,\u201d writes Professor of Asian and Middle Eastern Cultures, Rachel McDermott in her book, \u2018Encountering Kali: In the margins, at the center, in the west\u2019.",
              "Historical and iconographic sources show that she was perhaps at the margins of Brahmanical society between the third century BCE and seventh century CE, recognised mostly as a tribal Goddess.",
              "The first time she appears somewhere within the folds of Brahmanical Sanskritic tradition is perhaps the sixth century BCE in the text \u2018Devi Mahatmya\u2019 which is part of the Markandeya Purana, where she is depicted to be Goddess Durga\u2019s fury incarnate.",
              "In later centuries she is incorporated into Tantric ritual and philosophy and more recently by the seventeenth century CE, she is identified with devotional traditions, wherein she is observed as the loving mother.",
              "The divergences in the form and depictions that Kali denotes across different parts of the subcontinent is largely reflexive of the way in which her character developed and blended with local traditions and Hindu symbolism.",
              "On the occasion of Diwali and Kali Puja, here is a look at three diverging depictions of Goddess Kali among several others in India.",
              "Kalighat, the landing stage on the course of the river Hooghly in Calcutta is one of the most important seats of Goddess Kali and is visited by thousands of pilgrims every day.",
              "In Kolkata, unlike most parts of India, the demonic, cannibal-like qualities of Kali are toned down to depict an image that is dark and yet beautiful.",
              "\u201cShe is the perfection of youthful, charming, and feminine beauty,\u201d writes scholar of Hindu studies, Sanjukta Gupta in her article \u2018The domestication of a Goddess\u2019.",
              "Gupta notes that in her several visits to Kalighat, she witnessed the \u2018domestication\u2019 of Kali by the family and kinsmen of the Haldars, the priestly clan who enjoy ownership of the temple and manage its affairs.",
              "She explains that the means of Kali worship at kalighat depictive of a fusion between the non-vegetarian Sakta tradition of Hinduism, also considered at Tantrism and the vegetarian Vaishnava tradition, both of which have had a strong influence over Bengal since the 17th century.",
              "Also, the Krishna Bhakti tradition of Chaitanya that became popular in Bengal since the 16th century, also made its impact felt in the way Kali came to be worshipped there.",
              "\u201cAs a result of both such Vaishnava influences, by the eighteenth century in Bengal Kali was transformed from a wild, ferocious deity of death to a benign youthful mother, albeit capricious and crazy,\u201d writes Gupta.",
              "In the temple town of Bhubaneswar, Kali is depicted with ten hands that are armed with weapons emblematic of male Gods, grasping a bloody decapitated head, with her foot placed on the chest of Siva.",
              "Scholars Usha Menon and Richard A Shweder in their work, \u2018Dominating Kali: Hindu family values and Tantric power\u2019 write that the Kali iconography in Bhubaneswar is unmistakably Tantric with its extreme representation of female power.",
              "However, it has almost completely been assimilated into the mainstream Hinduism as is practised today in Bhubaneswar.",
              "\u201cFar from highlighting the potency of the female and her power to create and destroy with impunity, the icon is used to uphold Hindu family values, especially those encouraging female self-control and self-restraint,\u201d write Menon and Shweder.",
              "Further, Menon and Shweder suggest that the 15th century Oriya text, Chandi Purana provided the conceptual framework for a creative interpretation of the Tantric idol.",
              "Unlike the previous texts mentioning the Kali story, this particular story depicted Kali to be stepping upon Siva accidentally and that her expression is one of \u2018lajja\u2019 or shame.",
              "\u201cIt is awareness of that unequal domestic relationship that compels Kali to bite her tongue and hold in her anger,\u201d write Menon and Shweder.",
              "The idea of \u2018lajja\u2019 in association with Kali is the most common perception of the icon today, and provides ways to discuss, organise and better understand several issues that are important to Oriya Hindu culture.",
              "In Southern India, Kali takes the form of Bhadrakali, whose story is remarkably different from the ones popular across India.",
              "Here she is observed as the auspicious form of Kali who is believed to protect the good.",
              "She is depicted as having three eyes and four, sixteen or eighteen hands.",
              "She has a small tusk protruding from her mouth and flames flowing from her head.",
              "Though the origin of Bhadrakali is believed to be in Devi Mahatmyam of the Sakta tradition, the most popular version of her story perceives her to be the daughter of Siva, born to liberate the world of the demon Daruka.",
              "It is believed that she was born out of Siva\u2019s eyes with a ferocious look and countless hands.",
              "In Southern India several folk art and dance forms celebrate the event of her birth and her worship is believed to purify all devotees.",
              "Despite the varying ways in which Goddess Kali is depicted and celebrated across the country, is there a common thread that ties up the devotion to her?",
              "As McDermott reveals in her book \u201cshe maybe a bloodthirsty tribal deity, a goddess of esoteric tribal origins, the mother of devotional poets experiencing the political and social upheavals of eighteenth-century Bengal, or the terrible mother of universal female strength and rage, but in all cases, by her very multivalency, Kali expresses transformative power (sakti).",

              "[77] Throughout the epic, Rama's decisions were always in line with dharma (duty) and the Diwali festival serves as a reminder for followers of hinduism to maintain their dharma in day to day life.",
              "[78] Per another popular tradition, in the Dvapara Yuga period, Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, killed the demon Narakasura, who was the evil king of Pragjyotishapura, near present-day Assam, and released 16000 girls held captive by Narakasura.",

              "[90][11] Originally a Hindu festival, Diwali has transcended religious lines.",
              "[91] Diwali is celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Newar Buddhists,[2] although for each faith it marks different historical events and stories, but nonetheless the festival represents the same symbolic victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil.",

              "[71] According to Lorenz Franz Kielhorn, a German Indologist known for translating many Indic inscriptions, this festival is mentioned as Dipotsavam in verses 6 and 7 of the Ranganatha temple Sanskrit inscription of the 13th-century Venad Hindu king Ravivarman Samgramadhira.",
              "Part of the inscription, as translated by Kielhorn, reads: \"the auspicious festival of lights which disperses the most profound darkness, which in former days was celebrated by the kings Ila, Kartavirya and Sagara, (.",

              "The inscription states that Ramachandracharya built and dedicated a drama performance hall, with a golden cupola, on Diwali.",
              "[75][76][j] The religious significance of Diwali varies regionally within India.",
              "One tradition links the festival to legends in the Hindu epic Ramayana, where Diwali is the day Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman reached Ayodhya after a period of 14 years in exile after Rama's army of good defeated demon king Ravana's army of evil.",
              "[77] Throughout the epic, Rama's decisions were always in line with dharma (duty) and the Diwali festival serves as a reminder for followers of hinduism to maintain their dharma in day to day life.",
              "[78] Per another popular tradition, in the Dvapara Yuga period, Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, killed the demon Narakasura, who was the evil king of Pragjyotishapura, near present-day Assam, and released 16000 girls held captive by Narakasura.",
              "Diwali was celebrated as a signifier of triumph of good over evil after Krishna's Victory over Narakasura.",
              "The day before Diwali is remembered as Naraka Chaturdashi, the day on which Narakasura was killed by Krishna.",
              "[79] Many Hindus associate the festival with Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and wife of Vishnu.",
              "According to Pintchman, the start of the 5-day Diwali festival is stated in some popular contemporary sources as the day goddess Lakshmi was born from Samudra Manthana, the churning of the cosmic ocean of milk by the Devas (gods) and the Asuras (demons) \u2013 a Vedic legend that is also found in several Puranas such as the Padma Purana, while the night of Diwali is when Lakshmi chose and wed Vishnu.",
              "[41][80] Along with Lakshmi, who is representative of Vaishnavism, Ganesha, the elephant-headed son of Parvati and Shiva of Shaivism tradition, is remembered as one who symbolises ethical beginnings and the remover of obstacles.",
              "[77] Hindus of eastern India associate the festival with the Goddess Kali, who symbolises the victory of good over evil.",
              "[81][82][83] Hindus from the Braj region in northern India, parts of Assam, as well as southern Tamil and Telugu communities view Diwali as the day the god Krishna overcame and destroyed the evil demon king Narakasura, in yet another symbolic victory of knowledge and good over ignorance and evil.",
              "[84][85] Trade and merchant families and others also offer prayers to Saraswati, who embodies music, literature and learning and Kubera, who symbolises book-keeping, treasury and wealth management.",
              "[41] In western states such as Gujarat, and certain northern Hindu communities of India, the festival of Diwali signifies the start of a new year.",
              "[84] Mythical tales shared on Diwali vary widely depending on region and even within Hindu tradition,[86] yet all share a common focus on righteousness, self-inquiry and the importance of knowledge,[87][88] which, according to Lindsey Harlan, an Indologist and scholar of Religious Studies, is the path to overcoming the \"darkness of ignorance\".",
              "[89] The telling of these myths are reminiscent of the Hindu belief that good ultimately triumphs over evil.",
              "[90][11] Originally a Hindu festival, Diwali has transcended religious lines.",
              "[91] Diwali is celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Newar Buddhists,[2] although for each faith it marks different historical events and stories, but nonetheless the festival represents the same symbolic victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil.",
              "[6][7][92][93] A scholar of Jain and Nivethan, states that in Jain tradition, Diwali is celebrated in observance of \"Mahavira Nirvana Divas\", the physical death and final nirvana of Mahavira.",
              "The Jain Diwali celebrated in many parts of India has similar practices to the Hindu Diwali, such as the lighting of lamps and the offering of prayers to Lakshmi.",
              "However, the focus of the Jain Diwali remains the dedication to Mahavira.",
              "[94] According to the Jain tradition, this practice of lighting lamps first began on the day of Mahavira's nirvana in 527 BCE,[k] when 18 kings who had gathered for Mahavira's final teachings issued a proclamation that lamps be lit in remembrance of the \"great light, Mahavira\".",
              "[97][98] This traditional belief of the origin of Diwali, and its significance to Jains, is reflected in their historic artworks such as paintings.",
              "[99] Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas in remembrance of the release of Guru Hargobind from the Gwalior Fort prison by the Mughal emperor Jahangir and the day he arrived at the Golden Temple in Amritsar.",

              "Shiva surrenders his shirt and adornments to her, rendering him naked.",
              "[142] According to Handelman and Shulman, as quoted by Pintchman, this legend is a Hindu metaphor for the cosmic process for creation and dissolution of the world through the masculine destructive power, as represented by Shiva, and the feminine procreative power, represented by Parvati, where twelve reflects the number of months in the cyclic year, while thirty are the number of days in its lunisolar month.",

              "[145] According to Kinsley, the ritual use of cow dung, a common fertiliser, is an agricultural motif and a celebration of its significance to annual crop cycles.",

              "According to Pintchman, in some Hindu traditions the women recite tales where sisters protect their brothers from enemies that seek to cause him either bodily or spiritual harm.",
              "[149] In historic times, this was a day in autumn when brothers would travel to meet their sisters, or invite their sister's family to their village to celebrate their sister-brother bond with the bounty of seasonal harvests.",
