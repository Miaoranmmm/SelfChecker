    "query": "What is the most effective method for reducing or eliminating pain in surgical procedures, and what recent advancements have been made in pain management for patients?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. Pain management after surgery is a priority for both patients and doctors, as it can help speed recovery and reduce complications. There are different kinds of pain that one may feel after surgery, such as muscle pain, throat pain, or movement pain[^3^].\n\nThere are also different methods for reducing or eliminating pain, depending on the type and severity of the pain, the patient's preferences, and the doctor's recommendations. Some of the common methods are[^1^] [^2^] [^4^] [^5^] [^6^]:\n\n- Medications: These include over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil), prescription drugs such as opioids (morphine, oxycodone) or non-opioid analgesics (tramadol, gabapentin), and local anesthetics (lidocaine, bupivacaine) that can be injected or applied to the skin or nerves. Medications can be given orally, intravenously, through a pump, or through a patch. They have different benefits and risks, such as side effects, addiction, or tolerance.\n- Non-medication strategies: These include physical methods such as ice packs, heat pads, massage, acupuncture, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which can reduce inflammation, swelling, or nerve activity. They also include psychological methods such as relaxation techniques, distraction, hypnosis, or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which can help cope with stress, anxiety, or negative emotions related to pain.\n- Surgery and other procedures: These include invasive or minimally invasive interventions that aim to modify the source of pain or block the pain signals. Examples are radio waves, thermal (heat), or laser therapy that can destroy nerve endings or tissue; spinal cord stimulation (SCS) that can deliver electrical impulses to the spinal cord; nerve blocks that can inject anesthetics or steroids to specific nerves; or joint replacement that can repair damaged joints.\n\nSome recent advancements in pain management for patients are[^2^] [^4^]:\n\n- Multimodal analgesia: This is a strategy that combines different types of medications and non-medication methods to provide more effective and safer pain relief than using one method alone. For example, a patient may receive acetaminophen and ibuprofen regularly, plus an opioid for breakthrough pain, plus a local anesthetic injection at the surgical site, plus ice packs and relaxation exercises.\n- Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS): This is a comprehensive approach that involves optimizing various aspects of perioperative care (before, during, and after surgery) to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction. For example, a patient may receive preoperative education and counseling about pain management; multimodal analgesia during and after surgery; early mobilization and nutrition; and regular follow-up and feedback.\n\nI hope this information helps you understand more about pain management after surgery. If you have any questions or concerns about your own pain or treatment options, please consult your doctor or a pain specialist.",

              "There are also other types of opioids that are made artificially in a laboratory.",
              "These types are called synthetic or semi-synthetic opioids.",
              "Whether natural or synthetic, all opioids work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tract.",
              "When these drugs attach to certain opioid receptors, they block the transmission of pain messages to the brain.",
              "Opioids can do this because they look just like your body's natural painkillers, called endorphins.",
              "This similarity in structure \"fools\" receptors and allows the drug to activate the nerve cells, flooding the area with dopamine, a natural substance that affects the pleasure center(s) of your brain to cause euphoria or pleasant feelings.",
              "Large amounts of dopamine are released as the opioid activates the nerve cell, which produces the \"opioid effect.\"",

              "If you press the button too soon, the PCA device will not deliver medication.",
              "This way, there is no risk that you will receive too much pain medicine.",

              "Some examples of NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.",
              "NSAIDs work by preventing an enzyme (a protein that triggers changes in the body) from doing its job.",
              "The enzyme is called cyclooxygenase, or COX, and it has two forms. COX-1 protects the stomach lining from harsh acids and digestive chemicals.",

              "Aspirin and ibuprofen are common traditional NSAIDs.",
              "COX-2 inhibitors are a special category of NSAIDs.",
              "These medications target only the COX-2 enzyme that stimulates the inflammatory response.",
              "Because they do not block the actions of the COX-1 enzyme, these medications generally do not cause the kind of stomach problems that traditional NSAIDs do.",
              "COX-2 inhibitors, however, have possible cardiac side effects.",
              "Like NSAIDs, acetaminophen may be used after surgery to reduce the amount of stronger, opioid medications you need to control pain.",
              "Acetaminophen is often combined with opioid medicine in a tablet form.",
              "When taken in tablet form, opioids are not easily absorbed by the body.",
              "But when combined with acetaminophen, the medication absorbs easily and effectively relieves moderate to severe pain after surgery.",
              "Acetaminophen does not interfere with the COX-1 or COX-2 enzyme to reduce pain, so does not have anti-inflammatory properties.",
              "Scientists believe that acetaminophen relieves mild to moderate pain by elevating your body's overall pain threshold.",
              "It lowers your fever by helping your body eliminate excess heat.",

              "Tramadol is a synthetic opioid, which means that it is made in a laboratory and modeled after a popular opioid called codeine.",
              "Although it is technically an opioid because of its structure, the way it works in your body sets it apart from all the other opioids previously discussed.",
              "Tramadol relieves pain through two totally different methods.",
              "In one sense, tramadol works in the brain and spinal cord to change the way the body senses pain (like a traditional opioid).",
              "However, tramadol also works in a similar manner as some antidepressant medications, by interfering with the regulation of certain neuro-chemicals (serotonin and norepinephrine).",
              "When the amount of these chemicals is changed, it becomes difficult for pain messages to be relayed from one nerve cell to the next.",
              "Therefore, it reduces the amount of pain you feel.",
              "Although tramadol alone is helpful for treating moderate pain, it is most effective when used in combination with acetaminophen or NSAIDS.",
              "Just like any other drug, tramadol is associated with side effects, including dizziness and seizures.",
              "Local anesthetics block pain in a small area of the body.",
              "In orthopaedic surgery, they may be used as anesthesia during a procedure, or as part of a pain management program after surgery.",
              "For pain management, local anesthetics are given in a shot (or multiple shots) near your surgical incision, or as an epidural through a small tube in your back.",
              "These medicines work by blocking the pain signals that travel along the nerves to your brain.",
              "Local anesthetics do not cause the side effects of drowsiness, constipation, or breathing problems that you get with opioids.",
              "In orthopedic surgery, the most commonly used local anesthetics include lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine.",
              "Using local anesthetics carries the risk of a possible allergic reaction and may cause nerve damage, muscle spasms, and convulsions.",
              "For the most part, side effects can be avoided when you share your complete medical history with your doctor.",
              "Regional anesthetics offer the advantage of providing anesthesia during surgery and pain relief for several hours afterward.",
              "Medication is injected around the nerves in the part of your body having surgery.",
              "The medication can block feeling and movement in the lower part of your body (spinal, epidural) in one of your arms (intra-scalene, supraclavicular, axillary) or one of your legs (femoral, sciatic).",
              "Often, you can remain conscious during the procedure and require only light sedation.",
              "Other times, regional blocks may be used to supplement general anesthesia.",
              "Either way, you will have little or no pain when you wake up.",
              "Spinal and epidural anesthesia are neuraxial blocks.",

              "They can numb the area from the lower abdomen and pelvis down to the toes.",
              "A spinal is given as a single injection of a local anesthetic or morphine directly into the spinal canal.",
              "Since it is only a single injection its effect will last for the duration of the procedure but only a few hours afterward.",
              "Epidural anesthesia is given in the space around the spinal canal.",
              "The canal itself is protected by a lining membrane called the dura.",
              "The medication will pass through the dura and reach the spinal nerves.",
              "A small tube or catheter may be placed in the space around the dura and left in place for one or two days after surgery.",
              "Medication may then be given at intervals through the catheter.",
              "Epidural anesthesia often has less effect on the motor nerves than spinal and will allow for some function and mobility even when then catheter is in place.",
              "In addition to orthopaedic procedures, epidural anesthesia is often given to women during childbirth.",
              "The most common side effects of giving opioids via the spine are nausea and severe itching.",
              "The most serious side effect is respiratory depression, which means that your breathing slows down and becomes shallow.",
              "Although this rarely happens, your surgical team will closely monitor you for several hours in order to prevent or address all side effects.",

              "Many anesthesiologists now use ultrasound technology to help guide placement of the needle or catheter before medication is injected around the nerves.",
              "An image on a monitor shows the nerves, muscles, arteries, and veins in the affected area.",
              "This allows the anesthesiologist to make sure the medication is injected into the right place.",
              "Ultrasound is most commonly used for blocks involving the upper and lower extremities.",
              "Because it is not an x-ray there is no radiation exposure from the procedure.",

              "In orthopaedic surgery, there has been a recent trend toward combining different medicines with different methods to produce the most effective pain relief.",

              "To manage the moderate to severe pain after surgery, NSAIDs are often used in combination with opioids.",
              "Some examples of NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.",
              "NSAIDs work by preventing an enzyme (a protein that triggers changes in the body) from doing its job.",
              "The enzyme is called cyclooxygenase, or COX, and it has two forms. COX-1 protects the stomach lining from harsh acids and digestive chemicals.",

              "NSAIDs produce fewer side effects when compared to opioids.",
              "After surgery, using NSAIDs may reduce your need for opioid medications and, therefore, reduce opioid side effects like constipation and drowsiness.",

              "Aspirin and ibuprofen are common traditional NSAIDs.",
              "COX-2 inhibitors are a special category of NSAIDs.",
              "These medications target only the COX-2 enzyme that stimulates the inflammatory response.",
              "Because they do not block the actions of the COX-1 enzyme, these medications generally do not cause the kind of stomach problems that traditional NSAIDs do.",
              "COX-2 inhibitors, however, have possible cardiac side effects.",
              "Like NSAIDs, acetaminophen may be used after surgery to reduce the amount of stronger, opioid medications you need to control pain.",
              "Acetaminophen is often combined with opioid medicine in a tablet form.",
              "When taken in tablet form, opioids are not easily absorbed by the body.",
              "But when combined with acetaminophen, the medication absorbs easily and effectively relieves moderate to severe pain after surgery.",
              "Acetaminophen does not interfere with the COX-1 or COX-2 enzyme to reduce pain, so does not have anti-inflammatory properties.",

              "Tramadol is a synthetic opioid, which means that it is made in a laboratory and modeled after a popular opioid called codeine.",
              "Although it is technically an opioid because of its structure, the way it works in your body sets it apart from all the other opioids previously discussed.",
              "Tramadol relieves pain through two totally different methods.",
              "In one sense, tramadol works in the brain and spinal cord to change the way the body senses pain (like a traditional opioid).",
              "However, tramadol also works in a similar manner as some antidepressant medications, by interfering with the regulation of certain neuro-chemicals (serotonin and norepinephrine).",
              "When the amount of these chemicals is changed, it becomes difficult for pain messages to be relayed from one nerve cell to the next.",
              "Therefore, it reduces the amount of pain you feel.",
              "Although tramadol alone is helpful for treating moderate pain, it is most effective when used in combination with acetaminophen or NSAIDS.",
              "Just like any other drug, tramadol is associated with side effects, including dizziness and seizures.",
              "Local anesthetics block pain in a small area of the body.",
              "In orthopaedic surgery, they may be used as anesthesia during a procedure, or as part of a pain management program after surgery.",
              "For pain management, local anesthetics are given in a shot (or multiple shots) near your surgical incision, or as an epidural through a small tube in your back.",
              "These medicines work by blocking the pain signals that travel along the nerves to your brain.",
              "Local anesthetics do not cause the side effects of drowsiness, constipation, or breathing problems that you get with opioids.",
              "In orthopedic surgery, the most commonly used local anesthetics include lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine.",
              "Using local anesthetics carries the risk of a possible allergic reaction and may cause nerve damage, muscle spasms, and convulsions.",
              "For the most part, side effects can be avoided when you share your complete medical history with your doctor.",
              "Regional anesthetics offer the advantage of providing anesthesia during surgery and pain relief for several hours afterward.",
              "Medication is injected around the nerves in the part of your body having surgery.",
              "The medication can block feeling and movement in the lower part of your body (spinal, epidural) in one of your arms (intra-scalene, supraclavicular, axillary) or one of your legs (femoral, sciatic).",
              "Often, you can remain conscious during the procedure and require only light sedation.",
              "Other times, regional blocks may be used to supplement general anesthesia.",
              "Either way, you will have little or no pain when you wake up.",
              "Spinal and epidural anesthesia are neuraxial blocks.",
              "They block feeling and movement below the level at which they are given, typically the lower portion of the spine.",
              "They can numb the area from the lower abdomen and pelvis down to the toes.",
              "A spinal is given as a single injection of a local anesthetic or morphine directly into the spinal canal.",
              "Since it is only a single injection its effect will last for the duration of the procedure but only a few hours afterward.",
              "Epidural anesthesia is given in the space around the spinal canal.",
              "The canal itself is protected by a lining membrane called the dura.",
              "The medication will pass through the dura and reach the spinal nerves.",
              "A small tube or catheter may be placed in the space around the dura and left in place for one or two days after surgery.",
              "Medication may then be given at intervals through the catheter.",
              "Epidural anesthesia often has less effect on the motor nerves than spinal and will allow for some function and mobility even when then catheter is in place.",
              "In addition to orthopaedic procedures, epidural anesthesia is often given to women during childbirth.",
              "The most common side effects of giving opioids via the spine are nausea and severe itching.",
              "The most serious side effect is respiratory depression, which means that your breathing slows down and becomes shallow.",
              "Although this rarely happens, your surgical team will closely monitor you for several hours in order to prevent or address all side effects.",
              "Regional anesthetics can also be used to numb up a smaller area such as your arm or leg.",
              "In the upper extremity the most common blocks are In the lower extremity the most common blocks are As with an epidural, a catheter may be left in place following intra-scalene, supraclavicular, or femoral nerve blocks.",
              "It is used to provide pain relief for 24 to 48 hours following knee or shoulder surgery before it is removed by the anesthesiologist.",
              "Many anesthesiologists now use ultrasound technology to help guide placement of the needle or catheter before medication is injected around the nerves.",
              "An image on a monitor shows the nerves, muscles, arteries, and veins in the affected area.",
              "This allows the anesthesiologist to make sure the medication is injected into the right place.",
              "Ultrasound is most commonly used for blocks involving the upper and lower extremities.",
              "Because it is not an x-ray there is no radiation exposure from the procedure.",
              "There are many different pain medications (opioids, NSAIDs, anesthetics), and different methods for giving them (injections, tablets, epidurals).",
              "In orthopaedic surgery, there has been a recent trend toward combining different medicines with different methods to produce the most effective pain relief.",
              "In addition to improved pain management, a combined approach can reduce opioid use and the side effects associated with it.",

              "Because there is potential for WI or CWI to be beneficial, additional high-quality studies are needed to evaluate WI and CWI as part of multimodal recovery after vascular surgery [267].",
              "We believe that WI can be an important addition to ERAS protocols, and has the potential to be a low cost, easy and safe alternative to other techniques currently in ERAS protocols, such as nerve blocks or neuraxial analgesia.",
              "Literature data analysis and our experience helped us identify possible practice improvements.",
              "More research is needed on the role of liposomal bupivacaine in WI, particularly exploration of its efficacy and cost.",
              "Also, WI should be considered in emergency surgeries like abdominal aortic repair when regional blocks are impractical before incision.",
              "We also propose the combination of pre-incisional single-shot WI and postoperative CWI especially in abdominal surgery.",
              "Based on unpublished experience from the European Pain Federation (EFIC) supported international quality improvement project under the name PAIN OUT, we propose implementation of WI as part of multimodal management whenever possible, particularly when other regional anesthesia techniques are contraindicated.",
              "The limited duration of analgesia provided with WI necessitates the implementation of other modalities of care before the LA\u2019s effect is over.",
              "ERAS protocols strongly recommend intravenous lidocaine infusion for open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery [258], due to opioid-sparing effect, with reduced incidence of nausea, vomiting [269] and postoperative ileus [270].",
              "Published data suggest that toxicity of intravenous lidocaine is related to plasma concentration, and although toxicity is infrequent, monitoring patients for signs of toxicity is mandatory [271].",
              "Since lidocaine infusion has been used in genitourinary, gynecology, ambulatory, breast, spine and cardiothoracic surgery [270], the idea of combining IV lidocaine and WI with LA sounds tempting.",
              "However, because the pharmacokinetic profile of combining IV lidocaine infusion with LA WI has not been studied, safety is a major concern as it is reasonable to expect a higher incidence of toxic effects.",
              "We propose the use of a check list for single shot WI, which can be adjusted for CWI (Figure 3).",
              "As our literature search revealed that most studies use \u201cone size fits all\u201d LA dosage regimens, individually calculated LA doses need to be evaluated in future studies.",

              "Last, additional research is needed on potential WI immuno-modulatory effects, especially in oncologic surgery.",
              "WI and CWI are simple, practical steps in a multimodal approach to postoperative analgesia.",
              "WI requires less time and equipment and is cheaper, faster, and more acceptable to surgeons.",
              "CWI is superior to WI in terms of prolonged action, significantly reduced postoperative opioid consumption and opioid side effects, thus accelerating postoperative recovery.",
              "As access to educational material is becoming easy, patients are better informed about treatment options, and surgeons are increasingly aware of the importance of quick painless recovery after surgery.",
              "The economic benefit of fast recovery and return to work are also important.",
              "Furthermore, WI may present a valuable analgesia component in fragile patients, such as geriatric patients, obese patients and patients with multiple comorbid states or chronic pain.",
              "WI techniques have a low incidence of complications.",
              "They are simple and quick to perform, easy to manage, have opioid-sparing effect, and have no major contraindications, other than patient refusal or local infection.",
              "As new studies document the safety of infiltrative techniques, surgeons will likely accept and promote more frequent WI use based on the type of surgical procedures and individual patient needs.",

              "People can use oral administration for a range of medication types, such as pills, capsules, and liquids.",
              "However, one of the downsides of oral administration is that it can be inefficient.",
              "The digestive system and liver start to break down drugs via this route before they reach the bloodstream, meaning the concentration significantly reduces.",
              "This is known as the \u201cfirst pass effect.",
              "\u201d Additionally, some oral drugs can have adverse effects on the digestive system, and some people have difficulty swallowing pills.",

              "The intramuscular route is similar but involves an injection into a muscle instead.",
              "IV administration is suitable for many drugs, particularly in situations where a person needs an urgent, high, or consistent dose, such as during a severe infection.",
              "This is because IV drugs bypass the digestive system and take effect quickly.",

              "However, doctors can also prescribe it for other types of medical treatment.",
              "For example, some vaccines come in nasal forms. The benefits of administering medications via the nose are that it is painless, delivers a high concentration of the drug, and allows drugs to take effect quickly.",
              "However, only certain drugs work via nasal administration.",
              "Additionally, the dose and effect size may have limitations depending on the size and features of a person\u2019s nasal cavity and how they administer it.",

              "Additionally, the condition of the skin may affect absorption.",
              "For example, if it is dry or has open cuts, it may absorb too much or too little.",
              "Subcutaneous administration is typical for insulin and the anaphylaxis medication known as epinephrine.",
              "Because this level of the skin has few blood vessels, this option allows for a slow release of drugs.",
              "However, it is invasive and can be painful.",
              "The vaginal administration route involves inserting a drug into the vagina, where it gradually absorbs into the bloodstream.",

              "Vaginal administration can be useful for medications that act locally, such as antibiotic or antifungal medications for infections or hormone treatments for vaginal dryness or atrophy.",
              "It is also a route for some systemic drugs that affect the whole body.",
              "Vaginally-absorbed drugs can be easy to administer and are typically painless, but the drug may cause discomfort if it is a solid suppository.",

              "Only very few NPMs have been studied by high-quality RCTs and results are ambiguous, as reported above.",
              "However, for a few NPMs like TENS, a considerable evidence of analgesic efficacy is documented, yet this was not replicated by the current data.",
              "Second, use of NPMs in clinical routine might not always meet the high standards and skills provided in RCTs.",
              "Third, the somehow positive findings in knee surgery in the current study might indicate that the efficacy of (some) NPMs is related to specific surgeries.",
              "Fourth, standard pain management (e.",
              "g. drugs or regional analgesia techniques) was not controlled for or restricted.",
              "Therefore, effectiveness of these techniques might have masked the small effect of NPMs.",
              "Furthermore, some NPMs might have been used only by patients with severe pain.",
              "In other words, the level of pain might have caused use of NPMs, and not vice versa.",
              "Should NPMs therefore be abandoned?",
              "Considering the arguments from above and the low side-effect profile of most NPMs, they might still offer benefits for some patients.",
              "However, state-of-the-art application should be ensured, and NPMs should not replace analgesic interventions with proven effectiveness.",
              "The NPMs might furthermore improve communication and relationship between patients and clinical staff and increase overall patient satisfaction.",
              "Future research should study patient as well as surgery-specific conditions associated with improved outcomes, in detail.",
              "The current study had some limitations: First, the PAIN OUT registry was not a randomized controlled trial.",
              "For this reason, it is prone to confounding variables, some of which the researchers did not even know about.",
              "The researchers controlled for age and gender, which are well-known confounders for acute post-operative pain.",
              "Moreover, patients might have chosen NPMs on demand and thus the use of NPMs might characterize a subgroup of patients with more severe pain than in the group with no NPM use.",
              "Second, patients tend to use more than one NPM at a time.",
              "Hence, any analysis of single methods is influenced by other methods.",
              "Third, the analyses might suffer from the multiple testing problem.",
              "Since the analyses showed few statistically significant differences and only minor absolute differences, the researchers opted not to correct for multiple testing.",
              "Another concern was that patients might have used NPMs, yet not for pain relief.",
              "This could lead to a wrong report of usage patterns.",
              "For example, no patient selected music as a NPM for pain relief.",

              "Another reason for a higher comfort level in the menthol-group could be due to the easy handling of the menthol cooling.",
              "During the cooling with menthol bandage, the patients were hardly restricted and could applicate the bandage easily, even under the pants.",
              "During cooling with a cold pack, however, everyday movements are more difficult to perform and rather a complete immobilisation of the cooled area is needed.",
              "Of course, the self-specified pain-score and comfort-score is subjective and not objective.",
              "However, the importance of such subjective feelings for the medical staff or surgeon is often underestimated.",
              "The healing process is not only influenced by clinical, externally visible factors.",
              "Frequently subjective positive feelings represent important feedback and provide the basis for the healing process.",
              "Possibly due to the positive findings regarding pain-score and comfort-score in the menthol-group, there could be a thought to reduce therapy units and, thus, reducing costs for the health services.",
              "To summarise, the differences in cross section area might arise from a combination of the different parameters, such as the positive effects for healing process of menthol application, a punctual lower pain level, the lower absolute painkiller consumption and a resulting improved possibility for activity in the daily life of menthol-group.",
              "Furthermore, an improved and increased activity-level of menthol-group may have a positive influence by the increased comfort level and punctual decreased pain level during the cooling period of the first 30 days (a, b, c).",
              "Differences in the muscle cross section area are due to the importance of active musculoskeletal system, very relevant for the therapeutic outcome and had a strong influence of the muscle strength.",
              "Furthermore, an increased cross section area of vastus medialis was reported to be related to a reduced cartilage loss and a decreased risk for joint replacement.",
              "Furthermore, the slight moderate temperature drop, the associated significant longer cooling period and the mentioned above benefits of menthol, could be essential reasons for our positive findings.",
              "Currently there are many different opinions in medicine about the effects and benefits of cooling for the healing process.",
              "In addition to evidence of positive effects, possible disorders of the wound and damage of lymphatic vessels are being discussed.",
              "In our present study we could show that a more prolonged cooling method based on a menthol containing liquid resulted in a moderate drop in temperature and was applied for longer duration.",
              "In addition, positive subjective sensations and better output for clinically relevant parameters, such as a reduced muscle loss or absolute lower significant pain medication consumption, were observed.",
              "On the other hand, the study also showed that a too intensive cooling method with a rapid temperature drop and very low skin temperatures, such as the use of an ice or cold pack, had little or no benefit.",

              "Complications are of concern [20,21], as cement leakage occurred in 20\u201370% of patients [22,23,24,25], and cement embolism was found in 26% of patients [26].",

              "However, this statement remains unproven [41].",
              "Some authors reported that controlling pain with analgesics and then performing the CPB was more effective than an early block followed by pharmacotherapy [45].",
              "In patients with abdominal-pelvic pain, who were potential candidates to CPB or SHPB, the analgesic treatment with low doses of opioids was effective in all patients [45].",
              "It is likely that the efficacy of CPB depends on individual anatomical distribution, which is likely to be distorted with the local progression of the tumor.",
              "When tumor spread involves other somatic areas such as peritoneum or diaphragm, it is likely that the block will be less successful, as CPB can block the sympathetic pathways for visceral pain only.",
              "Pain may worsen due to the involvement of areas outside the territory dependent on sympathetic pathways.",
              "Indeed, no early procedure may prevent the subsequent neural and somatic structure involvement, which seems to be unpredictable [46].",
              "As pain and disease progression are unforeseeable, an early block could be disproportionate in many circumstances.",
              "On the other hand, a late block, when somatic structures are involved, or celiac area is distorted, is likely to be unsuccessful.",
              "Thus, the decision to perform a CPB should be based on detailed information regarding patient condition, aim of the treatment (reduction of opioid consumption or opioid adverse effects), and patient participation in decision making.",
              "Data regarding SHPB is sparse, as only one controlled clinical study has been produced [47].",
              "The origin of pelvic cancer-related pain, for which the technique is claimed, is even more complex, because different pain mechanisms may coexist due to the various overlapping structures including muscles and nerves [45].",
              "It is likely that this block of sympathetic pathways is unable to abolish the nociception.",
              "According to data from literature, there is a weak recommendation in favor of using this intervention.",
              "General contraindications for neurolytic blocks of sympathetic pathways include tumor invasion into the insertion site, coagulopathy, systemic or localized infection, complicated anatomy, and bowel obstruction [2,48].",
              "Reported complications are back pain, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhea, retroperitoneal hematoma, bladder or ureteral injury, and inadvertent somatic nerve damage [2,48].",
              "Different from neurolytic somatic blocks, CPB is claimed to be safe because neurological complications are unlikely and mostly transient when performed with CT guidance.",
              "A logical approach for pain otherwise difficult to treat is to block peripheral nerves with local anesthetics and thereby block the signaling of nociceptive input to the central nervous system.",
              "The selection of which nerve block to apply is dependent on the source of pain.",
              "Therefore, the physicians involved in administering peripheral nerve blocks must have good knowledge of the innervation supplied from each nerve and the anatomical localization and access to the nerve.",
              "Peripheral blocks currently reported that are applied to cancer-related pain include paravertebral blocks, brachial plexus blocks, blocks of nerves in the head region, and intercostal nerves.",
              "The drugs used for nerve blocks are local anesthetics, which have to be applied continuously or intermittently because of a limited duration of action.",
              "Local anesthetic in use are lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine, among others.",
              "The analgesic effect is similar, while toxicity may differ in relation to cardiac events and other local anesthetic toxic events.",
              "However, if the local anesthetic is given within the recommended dosages, the risk for toxicity is minimal.",
              "The duration of each local anesthetic action differs.",
              "Lidocaine is typically considered a local anesthetic of intermediate action (1.",
              "5\u20133 h), while bupivacaine and ropivacaine are long-action local anesthetics (4\u201318 h) [49].",
              "The duration may be altered by additives, such as epinephrine or clonidine, and varies between different localization of the nerve block [50].",
              "Therefore, for long-term therapy with local anesthetics, bupivacaine or ropivacaine is best suited, of which bupivacaine by tradition is the most frequently reported agent in use.",
              "Some reports on the use of peripheral nerve block applied neurolytic agents such as glycerol, phenol, or alcohol.",
              "These agents irreversibly destroy the nerve and only need a single injection for a long-term block of the signaling of the nerve impulse.",
              "The evidence for use of peripheral blocks is limited.",
              "A systematic review published in 2015 identified 16 papers, which reported a total of 79 cases [51].",
              "The nerve blocks were paravertebral blocks (10 cases), block in the head region (two cases), plexus blocks (13 cases), intercostal block (43 cases), and other (11 cases).",
              "Most cases experienced pain relief, many for several weeks.",
              "Except for catheter displacement and one report of toxic effects associated with injections of butamben, an ester local anesthetic not used in any other reports, and there were no adverse effects.",
              "This systematic review identified no controlled trials.",
              "An update (Nov 2018) using the same methods as in the systematic review mentioned [50] identified additionally two cases receiving interscalene continuous plexus blocks [52], one case with plexus phenol neurolysis [53], two cases with alcohol paravertebral neurolysis [54], and one case with a femoral nerve block [55].",
              "In summary, the evidence for use of peripheral blocks for cancer-related pain is still anecdotal.",
              "Still, the published cases illustrate the potential benefit from use of peripheral blocks.",
              "New techniques such as ultrasound identification of nerves, now routinely applied for use of local anesthesia during surgical procedures, will ease the placement of catheters for administration of local anesthetics.",
              "Moreover, techniques to ensure that catheters do not dislodge can be improved.",
              "Thus, physicians involved in treatment of cancer-related pain could benefit from collaboration with anesthesiologist involved in orthopedic surgery [56].",
              "At the time technical issues associated with continuous administration of local anesthetics improve, new studies should compare the use of peripheral blocks to current standard treatment of cancer-related pain.",
              "Such studies can compare patients\u2019 preferences in relation to inconveniences related to the use of local anesthetics (potential motor or sensory deficits and to carry an infusion pump) against opioid adverse effects.",
              "Local anesthetics have adverse effects related to the potential drug toxicity, to the effects from the nerve block in itself or as a complication to the procedure.",
              "Toxicity is not a clinical issue given that the local anesthetic is administered at recommended doses and not inadvertently injected intravascularly.",
              "However, because of a low, but still present risk of acute toxicity (cardiac toxicity and seizures) due to an intravascular injection, physicians administering nerve blocks should have the knowledge and equipment available to handle such incidents.",
              "Complications related to the effect from local anesthetic is not a major clinical issue.",
              "If, for instance, a plexus nerve block is given in a dose that paralyses the arm, the local anesthetic dose can simply be reduced, or the infusion discontinued, and motor function will resolve.",
              "Also, complications related to the procedure of insertion is not reported for patients with cancer-related pain.",
              "There may be a risk for nerve injury resulting in neuropathic pain but given that the procedure is performed by skilled personnel using adequate techniques, this risk is small.",
              "Moreover, peripheral block is not associated with risk such as meningitis, epidural abscesses or hematomas feared by central blocks.",
              "Neurolytic peripheral blocks, on the other hand, will result in permanent disability if wrongly performed, and may\u2014if correctly performed\u2014after some time, result in neuropathic pain caused by reinnervation.",
              "Therefore, neurolytic blocks should not be the first-choice treatment.",
              "It should be used rarely and only in patients with expected short survival time (<3 months).",
              "Percutaneous cordotomy by radiofrequency has become a viable choice due to advances on fluoroscopic equipment and the possibility of performing the procedure under sedation instead of general anesthesia (usual procedure in open cordotomy), which represents an advantage to fragile patients with advanced cancer.",
              "However, this intervention causes an irreversible disruption of the nervous conduction and, therefore, risks and consequences should be examined carefully.",
              "The selection of patients with cancer for this procedure is based on presence of malignant unilateral pain refractory to systemic treatment and other nondestructive interventions, life expectancy of few years or less considering the possibility of pain recurrence (lesioned nerves may regrow, and neuropathic pain may return), and anatomic location of the intervention that permits a safe procedure [2,57].",
              "It is recommended to treat unilateral pain caused by malignant pleural mesothelioma, breast cancer, brachial plexus pain related to pancoast tumor pressure/infiltration, or unilateral leg pain.",
              "This treatment can also be used in bilateral cancer-related pain, but bilateral interventions increase the risk of complications and mortality [58].",
              "Percutaneous cordotomy is a thermal lesion caused by radiofrequency electric current in spinothalamic tract contralateral to the side of the pain, interrupting conduction fibers and selectively eliminating pain and temperature sensation from the affected half of the body.",
              "Its mechanism is unclear, but alteration on descending impulse or dorsal horn modulation, damage of C fibers and immunomodulatory effect may all play a role on pain transmission [2].",
              "In conventional radiofrequency, the needle tip is heated between 80 \u00b0C and 90 \u00b0C, while in pulsed radiofrequency, the temperature is kept below 43 \u00b0C to avoid tissue harm [2].",
              "Radiofrequency lesions may be done at several sites, but main entry point is located over the C1/2 intervertebral foramen on the opposite side of the source of pain and may only be suitable to treat pain below the level of the C4 dermatome [58].",
              "Retrospective and uncontrolled studies suggested that percutaneous cordotomy is effective in reducing pain, and decreasing or discontinuing opioid use [59,60,61].",
