              "Although burnout was initially considered to be specific to professionals working in the care of people [5], later evidence has shown that this syndrome can develop among all types of professions and occupational groups [6,7].",

              "Likewise, the need to address burnout is also justified for legal reasons, such as compliance with the European Union Framework Directive on Health and Safety (89/391/EEC).",

              "Overall, burnout syndrome is an individual response to chronic work stress that develops progressively and can eventually become chronic, causing health alterations [24].",
              "From a psychological point of view, this syndrome causes damage at a cognitive, emotional, and attitudinal level, which translates into negative behavior towards work, peers, users, and the professional role itself [25].",
              "However, it is not a personal problem, but a consequence of certain characteristics of the work activity [26].",
              "Historically, Graham Greene was the first author to use the term burnout in his novel \u201cA Burnt-Out Case\u201d when describing the story of an architect who found neither meaning in his profession nor pleasure in life.",
              "Later, the term was picked up and introduced in the psychological sphere by Freudenberger [27], where he described burnout as a state of exhaustion, fatigue, and frustration due to a professional activity that fails to produce the expected expectations.",
              "Initially, this author delimited it as something exclusively related to volunteer workers in a care center where all kinds of people with mental disorders and social problems attended.",
              "Because of their occupation, these workers experienced in crescendo a loss of energy to the point of exhaustion and demotivation, as well as aggressiveness towards the service users.",
              "Shortly thereafter, Maslach [28] introduced burnout into the scientific literature and defined it as a gradual process of fatigue, cynicism, and reduced commitment among social care professionals.",
              "Years later and after several empirical studies, Maslach and Jackson [5] reformulated the concept and elaborated a more rigorous and operational definition of burnout as a psychological syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and a reduced sense of professional efficacy that can appear in caregivers (Table 1).",
              "The turning point between the two definitions is the consideration of burnout as a syndrome, with a syndrome being understood as a picture or set of symptoms and signs that exist at the same time and clinically define a particular state distinct from others.",
              "Burnout dimensions.",
              "However, some authors have argued that these three dimensions are not completely independent.",
              "Thus, it is possible to find several explanations in the literature.",
              "The difference between them lies in which is the first dimension that appears in the face of job stress (emotional exhaustion or depersonalization).",
              "Although definitive evidence has not yet been obtained, longitudinal studies have shown that there is a causal order between the key dimensions of burnout.",
              "Thus, high levels of emotional exhaustion lead to high levels of cynicism or depersonalization [29].",
              "Likewise, empirical studies indicate that exhaustion and depersonalization constitute the core or key dimensions of the syndrome of being burned out at work, while lack of professional fulfillment is considered as an antecedent of burnout or even a consequence [30].",
              "Finally, although Maslach and Jackson\u2019s [5] conceptualization of burnout remains the most widely accepted, other definitions or formulations are found in the scientific literature.",
              "For example, Salanova et al.",
              "[31] reformulate such approaches and propose an extended model of burnout composed of: (1) exhaustion (related to crises in the relationship between the person and work in general), (2) mental distance that includes both cynicism (distant attitudes towards work in general) and depersonalization (distant attitudes towards the people for and with whom one works) and (3) professional inefficacy (feeling of not doing tasks adequately and being incompetent at work).",
              "As an alternative to the unitary definition of burnout, Montero-Mari\u0301n [24] proposes that this syndrome does not always develop in the same way and that, on the contrary, there can be three variations that depend on the dedication of workers to their work activity (Figure 1).",
              "These subtypes could also be understood as stages in which there is a progressive deterioration in the levels of worker commitment to their job and have repercussions when choosing the intervention to be applied [32].",
              "From this theoretical perspective, burnout is considered a developing condition, with a progressive reduction in levels of engagement, and evolves from enthusiasm to apathy [24].",
              "Burnout is proposed to typically appear with the excessive involvement characteristic of the frenetic subtype.",
              "Since it is not easy to maintain this level of activity without becoming exhausted, the worker may adopt a certain protective distance.",
              "This distancing may relieve workers from overactivity, but at the cost of the frustration that emerges in the under-challenged subtype.",
              "In the long run, this leads to a reduced perception of efficacy, giving way to passive coping strategies, typically present in the worn-out subtype.",
              "The parallelism between the evolution of the syndrome and the different subtypes raises the possibility of implementing new lines of therapeutic intervention on burnout by understanding the subtypes as a succession of stages in the development of the syndrome [24].",
              "Indeed, empirical studies suggest a progressive deterioration from the frenetic to the under-challenged and worn-out [33].",
              "Nevertheless, more longitudinal studies are still needed to clarify the transition from one subtype to another and the evolution of the syndrome.",
              "Profiles and subtypes of burnout.",
              "The frenetic subtype is typical of work contexts with overload and workers who work intensely until exhaustion.",
              "It also tends to be more frequent in jobs with split shifts, temporary contracts and, in general, situations that force workers to be much more involved to keep the job.",
              "It is the subtype of burnout in which workers show greater dedication to work.",
              "At the motivational level, these workers show high involvement and need to obtain important achievements and it has been related to a coping style based on the attempt to solve problems actively, for which they use a high number of working hours per week or are involved in different jobs at the same time.",
              "For all these reasons, this profile is associated with high levels of burnout and a feeling of abandonment of personal life and health at work.",
              "The under-challenged subtype is typical of monotonous and unstimulating professions, with repetitive, mechanical, and routine tasks that do not provide the necessary satisfaction to workers, who state that the work is not rewarding and is monotonous.",
              "Consequently, workers show indifference, boredom, and lack of personal development along with a desire to change jobs.",
              "This subtype of burnout is related to high levels of cynicism, due to a lack of identification with work tasks, and is associated with an escapist coping style, based on distraction or cognitive avoidance.",
              "The worn-out subtype is characterized mainly by feelings of hopelessness and a sense of lack of control over the results of their work and recognition of the efforts invested, so that they finally opt for neglect and abandonment as a response to any difficulty.",
              "It is, therefore, the profile in which the worker shows less dedication.",
              "Thus, this type of profile is strongly associated with the perception of inefficiency and a passive style of coping with stress, based mainly on behavioral disconnection, which generates a strong sense of incompetence and makes them experience feelings of guilt.",
              "Since the appearance of the term in the scientific literature, several approaches have emerged that have attempted to answer the question of why burnout appears and how it develops.",
              "In this section, we will focus on detailing the most current and empirically supported explanatory theories of burnout considering that, instead of being antagonistic to each other, they are complementary and provide a more global view of this syndrome.",
              "Specifically, the following theories are summarized: (1) social cognitive theory;",
              "(2) social exchange theory;",
              "(3) organizational theory;",
              "(4) structural theory;",
              "(5) job demands\u2013resources theory;",
              "(6) emotional contagion theory.",
              "This approach is characterized by giving a central role to individual variables such as self-efficacy, self-confidence and self-concept in the development and evolution of burnout [34,35].",
              "So, this syndrome is triggered when the worker harbors doubts about their own effectiveness, or that of their group, in achieving professional goals [36,37].",
              "These approaches were corroborated in a study conducted in a Spanish context with 274 secondary school teachers showing that burnout occurred after the emergence of professional efficacy crises [36].",
              "The circumstances facilitate the development of inefficacy expectations or efficacy crises are the following [38]: (1) negative experiences of failure in the past, (2) lack of reference models who have gone through a similar experience and have overcome it, (3) lack of external reinforcement for the work, (4) lack of feedback on the work completed or excessive negative criticism, and (5) difficulties at work.",
              "In this way, crises of effectiveness would lead to low professional fulfillment which, if maintained over time, would generate emotional exhaustion and then cynicism/depersonalization as a way of coping with stress (Figure 2).",
              "Development of burnout according to the socio-cognitive theory of the self-efficacy.",
              "This theory considers that burnout occurs when the worker perceives a lack of equity between the efforts and contributions made and the results obtained in their work [39].",
              "This lack of reciprocity, which can occur with service users, colleagues, supervisors, and organizations, consumes the emotional resources of professionals, generating an emotional exhaustion that becomes chronic.",
              "From this approach, burnout can be triggered by the significant interpersonal demands involved in dealing with clients/users that become emotionally consuming.",
              "Thus, to avoid contact with the original source of discomfort, depersonalization or cynicism is used as a stress coping strategy, which ultimately leads to low personal fulfillment (Figure 3).",
              "Development of burnout according to social exchange theory.",
              "This approach considers that burnout is a consequence of organizational and work stressors (see Section 3.",
              "1) combined with inadequate individual coping strategies [40,41].",
              "Within this theory, there are two alternative models to explain the relationships between the dimensions of burnout.",
              "According to Golembiewski et al.",
              "[41], burnout starts because of the existence of organizational stressors or risk factors, such as work overload or role ambiguity, and before which some individuals show as a coping strategy a decrease in their organizational commitment, which is very similar to cynicism and depersonalization.",
              "Subsequently, the person will experience low personal fulfillment at work and emotional exhaustion, which triggers burnout syndrome.",
              "Thus, depersonalization would be the first phase of burnout, followed by a feeling of low self-fulfillment and, finally, emotional exhaustion.",
              "The alternative proposal is that put forward by Cox et al.",
              "[40].",
              "For these authors, the emotional exhaustion caused by enduring work stressors is the initial dimension of this syndrome.",
              "Depersonalization is considered a coping strategy in the face of emotional exhaustion and low personal fulfillment is the result.",
              "This approach postulates that burnout occurs when there is an imbalance between the demands and resources derived from work [42].",
              "Job demands are those job factors that require sustained physical or mental effort and are associated with certain physiological costs due to activation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis and psychological costs (e.",
              "g., subjective fatigue, reduced focus of attention, and redefinition of task requirements).",
              "Common work demands include work overload, emotional labor, time pressure, or interpersonal conflicts.",
              "When recovery in the face of such demands is insufficient or inadequate, a state of physical and mental exhaustion is triggered.",
              "Work resources, on the other hand, refer to the physical, psychological, organizational, or social aspects of work that can reduce the demands of work and the associated physiological and psychological costs and that can be decisive in achieving work objectives.",
              "Resources at work can be organizational in nature, but also personal (Table 2).",
              "When demands exceed resources, fatigue occurs;",
              "if this imbalance is maintained over time, fatigue becomes chronic and, finally, burnout appears.",
              "Therefore, job demands have a direct and positive relationship with burnout, especially emotional exhaustion, while the existence of job resources inversely influences depersonalization by minimizing or reducing its use as a coping strategy.",
              "Summary of main demands and job resources.",
              "This approach maintains that burnout is a response to chronic job stress that appears when the coping strategies employed by the individual to manage job stressors fail.",
              "Initially, work stress will elicit a series of coping strategies.",
              "When the coping strategies initially employed are not successful, they lead to professional failure and to the development of feelings of low personal fulfillment at work and emotional exhaustion.",
              "Faced with these feelings, the subject develops depersonalization attitudes as a new form of coping.",
              "(The sequence is illustrated in Figure 4.)",
              "In turn, burnout will have adverse consequences both for the health of individuals and for organizations.",
              "This model has been empirically contrasted with different professional groups such as teachers or nurses [43].",
              "Development of burnout according to structural theory.",
              "Emotional contagion refers to the tendency to automatically imitate and synchronize facial expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of other people and, consequently, to converge emotionally with them [44].",
              "When people work together, it is common for them to share situations and experience collective emotions, such as sadness, fear, or exhaustion.",
              "Therefore, from this theory it is considered that burnout occurs in work groups, since there are shared beliefs and emotions that are developed throughout social interaction [38].",
              "This burnout contagion has been evidenced especially in teaching and health personnel [45], as well as between spouses (outside work).",
              "Thus, emotional contagion influences the development of burnout both inside and outside the workplace [26,46].",
              "The antecedents are those aspects that are going to propitiate, trigger, and/or maintain people suffering from burnout syndrome.",
              "In general, these aspects can be classified into two broad categories: (1) organizational factors such as, for example, the workload or the emotional demands involved, and (2) individual factors such as, for example, the worker\u2019s personality or coping strategies.",
              "It is important to emphasize that this syndrome is primarily a consequence of exposure to certain working conditions and not an individual characteristic such as a personality trait.",
              "Strictly speaking, therefore, the triggers of burnout would be factors related to the work (be it content, structure or relationships with users, clients, bosses, and/or colleagues).",
              "However, it is considered that, although organizational factors are capable per se of generating burnout, certain individual factors would act as moderating variables.",
              "Thus, personal aspects such as, for example, a lack of self-confidence or the use of stress-avoidance coping mechanisms could play a role in enhancing situational factors.",
              "On the other hand, other individual characteristics, such as optimism or active coping, can lessen or even slow down the negative effect of organizational factors on burnout and its consequences.",
              "Regarding situational factors, reviews of the scientific literature [47] show that, in general, both the type of tasks, the way they are organized and the relationships between colleagues, bosses, and/or clients are potential burnout triggers or risk factors.",
              "Workload, both quantitative and qualitative, when excessive, requires sustained effort, generating physiological and psychological costs.",
              "Such symptoms can trigger the experience of burnout and psychological distancing from work as a self-defense mechanism [48].",
              "Emotional labor is understood as the psychological process necessary to self-regulate one\u2019s emotions and show those emotions desired by the organization.",
              "It involves controlling or hiding negative emotions such as anger, irritation or discomfort to comply with the rules or requirements of the organization and objectives of the job, as well as the display of emotions not felt, such as sympathy towards customers or users, although the opposite is really felt, or tranquility in situations in which what is really felt is fear.",
              "Emotional labor will therefore involve a greater workload.",
              "In this sense, several studies have shown positive relationships between emotional labor and burnout in different professions, such as teachers [49] and HR department workers [50].",
              "Lack of freedom at work when performing tasks, as well as the inability to influence decisions that affect work has been positively associated with higher levels of burnout.",
              "Conversely, when workers experience autonomy and control over their work, there are lower rates of burnout and higher rates of professional fulfillment [48].",
              "In this line, several investigations have found negative relationships between burnout and empowerment, so that the greater the empowerment perceived by workers, the lower the levels of burnout experienced [51,52].",
              "When the worker does not know what is expected of them and/or does not have enough information about their mission (role ambiguity) or in their case the different tasks and demands to be fulfilled are incongruent or incompatible with each other (role conflict), burnout levels are increased [53].",
              "The perception of inadequate supervision (e.",
              "g., excessively directive, and unfair by only focusing on the negative aspects without valuing achievements and efforts, or at the other extreme not at all directive or non-existent) increases the risk of developing burnout.",
              "On the contrary, a fair treatment with employees favors the increase in available resources, exerting a negative effect on emotional exhaustion in such a way that workers are less likely to develop burnout symptomatology [54].",
              "Lack of social support at work, either from co-workers or supervisors, as well as internal conflicts between co-workers are considered important triggers of burnout.",
              "On the contrary, social support has been found to act as a brake on this syndrome [55].",
              "The working hours conditions that make it difficult to reconcile family and professional life are another important trigger of burnout.",
              "For instance, shift work, high rotations, night work, long working hours, or a large amount of overtime are powerful triggers of burnout.",
              "Additionally, such hourly characteristics are positively related to sleep disorders, heart problems, health complaints, job dissatisfaction, decreased attention and performance, as well as an increased risk of accidents [48].",
              "Regarding individual factors, both personality traits and sociodemographic variables and coping strategies have been analyzed as predisposing or facilitating the development of burnout in the case of the presence of some of the organizational factors explained above.",
              "Table 3 summarizes these factors and their modulating effect on burnout: positive (they amplify the effect of social factors) or negative (they reduce the effect of social factors).",
              "Individual burnout modulators.",
              "Personality influences how people perceive their work environment and, therefore, how they manage and cope with work demands and resources.",
              "Several studies [56,57,58] conclude that the personality traits posited in the Big Five model (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience;",
              "[59]) are significantly but differentially associated with burnout.",
              "Thus, it has been found that there is a negative correlation between extraversion and the components of burnout.",
              "Thus, extraversion will be a protective factor against burnout.",
              "As for neuroticism or emotional instability, positive correlations have been found with burnout.",
              "Therefore, people with less emotional stability will be more likely to suffer from burnout.",
              "Agreeableness is another personality factor that has shown a protective effect on burnout, so that more-agreeable workers tend to experience less burnout than their less-agreeable colleagues.",
              "Likewise, conscientiousness, or the tendency to behave responsibly and persistently, reduces the likelihood of burnout.",
              "Finally, openness to experience that represents aspects related to breadth of interests and creativity also has protective effects on burnout as it is positively associated with professional efficacy and negatively associated with depersonalization.",
              "Other individual characteristics that influence the development of burnout are the external locus of control, the type A behavior pattern and having high expectations.",
              "Locus of control [60] refers to the degree to which people believe they have control over events and their lives (internal locus of control) and the degree to which they believe that events occur due to external causes such as chance or the decisions of others (external locus of control).",
              "The greater the external locus of control, the greater the probability of developing burnout, especially in ambiguous or novel situations, in which the persons believe they have little or no possibility of controllability.",
              "Type A behavior pattern is characterized by competitiveness, impulsivity, impatience, and aggressiveness, and has been widely implicated as a health risk factor.",
              "This behavior pattern is positively related to the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization factors of burnout.",
              "Finally, the expectations that employees have regarding their work are related to the level of burnout, such that higher expectations and higher goal setting lead to greater efforts and thus higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization [47,48].",
              "The person\u2019s level of involvement also seems to be important.",
              "Specifically, over-involvement has also been proposed as a potent trigger, especially when it may be impossible to achieve goals.",
              "This mismatch between expectations and realities can lead to frustration and burnout in workers.",
              "In terms of sociodemographic variables, reviews of studies [47,48] point to an inverse relationship between age and burnout, such that people will experience lower levels of burnout as their age increases.",
              "However, the results are not always so consistent.",
              "A systematic review of the determinants of burnout [61] found a significant relationship between increasing age and increased risk of depersonalization, although on the other hand there is also a greater sense of personal accomplishment.",
              "Regarding gender, most studies indicate that emotional exhaustion and low professional fulfillment tend to be more common among women while depersonalization is more frequent in men.",
              "In relation to marital status, workers who are single (especially men) seem to be more exposed to burnout compared to those who live with a partner.",
              "However, such findings seem to be more appropriate in men, as in the case of working women, it constitutes an additional risk factor since working women are usually responsible for household chores and, therefore, this may pose a difficulty in reconciling personal and professional life.",
              "Coping strategies are another variable that play an important role in the development of burnout [62,63].",
              "Although there are several classifications of coping strategies, the most established one is the distinction between problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping [64].",
              "Problem-focused coping represents an attempt to act directly on the stressful situation, whereas emotion-focused coping focuses on modifying negative emotional responses to stressful events, avoiding intervening on them.",
              "Empirical evidence suggests that, in general, avoidance and emotion-focused coping are positively related to burnout, that is, they favor it, whereas active and problem-focused coping are negatively related to burnout, that is, they reduce it.",
              "However, not all emotion-focused coping strategies increase burnout, as social support-seeking, reappraisal, and religious support, in some cases, have protective effects on burnout [55].",
              "On the other hand, it has also been proposed that the effectiveness of problem-focused coping may depend on the control that individuals can exert over potential stressors in the work environment.",
              "Specifically, the use of problem-focused active coping strategies when there is little possibility of controlling and/or changing environmental stressors may exacerbate the undesirable effects of work stress;",
              "in such situations it is more advisable to employ coping strategies to facilitate adaptation to the situation.",
              "Therefore, one cannot be blunt in concluding that emotion-focused coping strategies are always negative since problem-focused coping only seems adaptive in controllable situations, while avoidance-oriented coping is adaptive in situations that are difficult to control [65].",
              "This section has focused on summarizing the main triggers of burnout.",
              "However, since burnout symptoms develop and evolve differently depending on individual characteristics (e.",
              "g., personality or coping strategies) and the work environment (e.",
              "g., job demands or leadership styles), it is necessary to continue advancing the knowledge of which are the personal factors that in combination with certain contextual triggers produce greater or lesser symptomatology.",
              "For example, when faced with the same stressor, do all personality types experience the same symptoms and consequences?",
              "Which personalities are more vulnerable to developing burnout when faced with specific triggers?",
              "Which are the most potentially harmful combinations of individual characteristics and contextual triggers?",
              "And which are the least?",
              "From a temporal perspective, it would also be necessary to carry out more longitudinal studies to study the evolution of symptomatology.",
              "Finally, and because of the increase in home working during the COVID-19 pandemic, it would also be interesting to examine whether teleworking may cause a greater or lesser occurrence of this symptomatology, compared to face-to-face work, as well as to examine possible differences depending on the sector of activity.",
              "Burnout results in a series of adverse consequences both for the individuals who suffer from it and for the organizations in which these professionals work.",
              "These consequences are initially of a psychological nature, but maintained over time, they translate into adverse effects on the physical/biological health and behaviors of workers, which in turn will have undesirable organizational consequences [66].",
              "The psychological alterations generated by the syndrome of being burned out at work occur at both cognitive and emotional levels.",
              "Different studies have associated this syndrome with concentration and memory problems, difficulty in making decisions, reduced coping capacity, anxiety, depression, dissatisfaction with life, low self-esteem, insomnia, irritability and increased alcohol and tobacco consumption [66,67].",
              "Other researchers have also shown that this syndrome can pose a significant risk of suicide [68].",
              "Several reviews of studies conclude that employees with higher levels of burnout are more likely to suffer from a variety of physical health problems such as musculoskeletal pain, gastric alterations, cardiovascular disorders, headaches, increased vulnerability to infections, as well as insomnia and chronic fatigue [69].",
              "Burnout has also been found to dangerously increase blood cortisol levels [70] and constitutes an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes [71].",
              "Now, the way these symptoms manifest themselves is not the same in all individuals, nor do they all have to occur.",
              "In addition to physical and psychological health problems, in general, burnout is also directly related to job dissatisfaction [72], low organizational commitment [66], increased absenteeism [73], turnover intention [74], and reductions in performance [47].",
              "On the other hand, some employees with burnout syndrome may justifiably leave their job;",
              "however, others decide to remain working [75].",
              "This may lead to work presenteeism (i.",
              "e., individuals go to work, although they do not really fulfill their responsibilities due to health issues).",
              "In addition, burnout can lead to deviant and counterproductive behaviors in workers, aggressiveness among colleagues and towards users, alcohol and psychotropic drug use, misuse of corporate material, or even theft [68,69,75,76].",
              "However, the form and evolution of these individual consequences (psychological, health, and behavioral) is not the same in all cases.",
              "In this sense, and although it is not always easy to delimit them, four levels of burnout syndrome have been described [77]: The negative consequences experienced at the individual level by workers with burnout translate into low motivation and performance that can extend to the work unit and the organization, causing a reduction in the quality of services [78].",
              "Likewise, employees suffering from burnout influence the rest of the organization, causing greater conflicts or interrupting work tasks, thus reducing production and increasing production times [67].",
              "Therefore, as indicated in the emotional contagion theory, burnout can cause a \u201ccontagion effect\u201d, generating a bad working environment [45].",
              "This syndrome also usually generates significant economic losses as a consequence of absenteeism, loss of efficiency and counterproductive behaviors [76].",
              "It would be interesting to examine in depth the relationships between the psychological alterations caused by burnout and the effects on workers\u2019 health, safety, and performance.",
              "For example, how psychological damage caused by burnout influences workers\u2019 attitudes and behavior, and exploration of the possible modulating role of individual factors and certain organizational characteristics (i.",

              "In addition, longitudinal studies would be necessary to analyze the possible relationship between the different consequences of burnout and productivity.",
              "Now we have established what burnout is and what circumstances trigger it, in this section we will focus on how to act both to avoid and to reverse its occurrence and consequences.",
              "First, the most appropriate type of preventive intervention should be selected.",
              "Primary prevention is aimed at all workers and its purpose is to reduce or eliminate organizational risk factors to prevent the occurrence of burnout.",
              "Primary prevention is the most consistent with the principles of an occupational risk prevention management system by providing workers with adequate support, job adaptations, information, and adequate training to deal with this psychosocial risk.",
              "Secondary prevention, on the other hand, is carried out once the first symptoms of burnout have appeared, so it is not aimed at all workers, but only at those who are already affected and its purpose in general is that such symptoms do not evolve further, improving the way in which the person responds to these stressors.",
              "These interventions are aimed more at individuals than at the organization, bringing about changes in attitudes and improving their coping resources, which does not imply that there are no organizational interventions as well.",
              "Finally, tertiary prevention focuses on employees who are already burned out at work.",
              "The aim of this type of prevention is to reduce the most severe harms (e.",
              "g., serious health problems and/or poor job performance).",
              "Since this type of intervention is aimed at trying to resolve the damage to the worker\u2019s physical and/or psychological health, it is considered reactive and not strictly speaking prevention, but treatment.",
              "From another perspective, we will classify the interventions considering the promoter of the intervention, that is, who organizes, decides and, if necessary, finances the actions to be carried out.",
              "In this sense, interventions can be classified as follows: (1) promoted by the organization, which in turn could be subdivided into actions directed at the organizational and job structure and actions directed at employees, and (2) promoted by individuals, which could also be subdivided into interventions directed at oneself as an individual and interventions directed at improving one\u2019s interaction with the organization and with aspects of the job (Table 4).",
              "Summary of burnout interventions.",

              "if we do not attend to our own functioning and wellness, we can be at risk of developing problems with our professional competence (Elman & Forrest, 2007).",
              "Despite its many rewards, the practice of psychotherapy may cause us to experience feelings of distress.",
              "Distress is described as the subjective emotional reaction we each experience in response to the many stressors, challenges, and demands in our lives (Barnett, Johnston, & Hillard, 2006).",
              "Distress is a normal part of life and we each experience it, whether in response to working with difficult clients, coping with insurance paperwork requirements, caring for an ill loved one, experiencing financial concerns, and myriad other acute and chronic challenges and stressors in our lives.",
              "While distress is a normal part of life, distress left unchecked over time can lead to burnout, what Baker (2003) describes as \u201cthe terminal phase of therapist distress\u201d (p.",
              "21).",
              "Burnout, a term first coined by Freudenberger (1975), has three components: Each of these components fall along a continuum and one may experience varying amounts of each at different times during one\u2019s career.",
              "While there is not a specific agreed upon point where one is classified as \u201cburned out,\u201d it is vital that we each are self-aware and monitor ourselves for these signs of burnout.",
              "While of course, prevention is always best, when signs of burnout begin to develop it is hoped that we each will take a step back, reassess our current situation, and make the needed changes in our lives to help us get back on track.",
              "Another important component of this distress \u2013 burnout continuum is vicarious traumatization (also at times referred to secondary traumatic stress or compassion fatigue).",
              "When treating clients who were victims of trauma, psychotherapists may themselves be traumatized by the emotionally intense experience of engaging in this type of psychotherapy.",
              "This may result in the psychotherapist developing many of the same intrusive and debilitating symptoms for which the client was being treating (Figley, 1995;",
              "Pearlman & Saakvitne, 1995).",
              "Yet, distress is not only a concern for psychotherapists who treat victims of trauma.",
              "As has been highlighted, distress is a universal phenomenon.",
              "More importantly, how we respond to the experience of distress is key, along with preventive steps we take and strategies used to minimize its deleterious effects.",

              "6% of mental health clinicians surveyed to acknowledge working when too distressed to be effective.",
              "Yet, 85% of these clinicians acknowledged that doing so was unethical.",
              "There are many aspects of the work of being a psychotherapist that may contribute to the distress \u2013 burnout continuum.",

              "Thus, it is vital that each psychotherapist participate in the ongoing practice of self-care.",
              "Self-care includes those activities we may engage in to promote our emotional, physical, relational, and spiritual/religious wellness.",
              "In fact, one may consider the ongoing practice of self-care to be an ethical imperative.",
              "Self-care can involve so many different activities.",
              "It may include getting adequate sleep each night, maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, spending time with family and friends, participating in various forms of relaxation to include meditation or yoga, attending to your spiritual and/or religious side, playing with your pet, engaging in artistic expression, doing pleasure reading, and so much more.",
              "It also involves setting limits, saying \u2018no\u2019, maintaining healthy boundaries, and knowing your limits.",
              "Self-care also involves maintaining a healthy balance between various professional activities as well as between the professional and personal parts of our life.",

              "As our life circumstances change over time, so too should our self-care practices.",
              "Additionally, we should each engage in ongoing self-reflection and self-assessment to ensure that our self-care needs are adequately being met.",
              "Along these lines, we should each become aware of and pay attention to our personal warning signs that tell us that we may not adequately be meeting our ongoing self-care needs.",
              "Examples may include being in session with clients and experiencing boredom, feeling anger or resentment toward clients, daydreaming while in session, wishing you were somewhere else, watching the clock and counting down the minutes until the session ends, ending sessions early, missing or canceling appointments, feeling fatigued, loss of enjoyment, low motivation, impaired sleep, and self-medicating.",
              "Each psychotherapist should make a concerted effort to integrate ongoing self-care activities into our daily lives.",
              "That doesn\u2019t mean that we engage in every possible self-care activity every day, but that we are mindful of our self-care needs and actively work to address them on an ongoing basis.",
              "This also means that we consciously work to avoid engaging in negative or maladaptive behaviors that are likely to contribute to increased distress and not likely to promote effective self-care.",
              "There exists a wide range of self-care activities we each may engage in.",
              "In a study of 400 practicing psychologists, Case (2001) found the most commonly used self-care strategies to include the use of meditation and prayer, socializing with friends, maintaining a diversity of professional roles, maintaining relationships with one\u2019s family of origin as well as with friends, and engaging in relaxation activities to promote one\u2019s well-functioning.",
              "More recently, Cooper (unpublished dissertation) found psychologists using the following strategies to engage in self-care: Use of humor (91.",
