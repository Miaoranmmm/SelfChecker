    "response": "Sure, I can explain the physics behind how a plane is able to fly, and how advancements in technology have improved the efficiency and safety of air travel.\n\nThe physics of flight involves four basic forces: lift, weight, thrust and drag[^1^] [^2^]. Lift is the force that pushes the plane upward by creating a difference in air pressure above and below the wings. Weight is the force of gravity that pulls the plane downward. Thrust is the force that propels the plane forward by pushing air backward. Drag is the force that opposes the motion of the plane by creating friction and resistance in the air.\n\nTo fly, a plane needs to generate enough lift to overcome its weight, and enough thrust to overcome its drag[^2^] [^3^]. The shape and angle of the wings, as well as the speed and direction of the air flow, affect how much lift and drag are produced. The engine, propeller or jet, as well as the fuel efficiency and aerodynamics of the plane, affect how much thrust is produced.\n\nAdvancements in technology have improved the efficiency and safety of air travel by designing better wings, engines, materials, instruments and systems for planes. For example, modern wings are often swept back or have winglets to reduce drag and increase lift[^4^]. Modern engines are more powerful, reliable and fuel-efficient than older ones[^4^]. Modern materials are lighter, stronger and more durable than traditional ones[^4^]. Modern instruments and systems help pilots navigate, communicate and control the plane more accurately and easily[^4^].\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the physics of flight better.\ud83d\ude0a",

              "For a plane or bird to fly, its wings must produce enough lift to equal its weight.",
              "Most wings used in flight are a special shape \u2013 called aerofoils (or airfoils).",
              "This shape is needed to help generate lift.",
              "The explanation for lift has been traditionally attributed to a Swiss mathematician named Daniel Bernoulli (pronounced Ber-noo-lee).",
              "However, recently, many scientists have debated whether the use of the Bernoulli principle to explain how wings work is, in fact, correct.",
              "Many feel that using the Bernoulli principle, commonly taught in schools, is either incorrect or should not be used as a single explanation for lift.",
              "This is an interesting example of how science ideas are constantly being challenged.",
              "Many people now argue that angle of attack, based on Newton\u2019s third law of motion, is a more effective explanation for lift.",
              "It appears there are actually a number of explanations for lift that include the angle of attack and the Bernoulli principle and that these explanations work together to explain how lift is produced.",
              "Science ideas and concepts are constantly being challenged.",
              "Scientists are currently considering the Bernoulli principle concerning its explanation for flight.",
              "Many scientists now believe it is incorrect to use this principle as it has been used.",
              "However, part of it is compatible with Newton\u2019s third law of motion as an explanation.",
              "Newton\u2019s third law of motion states that, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
              "Based on this law, wings are forced upwards because they are tilted, pushing air downwards so the wings get pushed upwards.",
              "This is the angle of attack or the angle at which the wing meets the airflow.",
              "As air flows over the surface of a wing, it sticks slightly to the surface it is flowing past and follows the shape.",
              "If the wing is angled correctly, the air is deflected downwards.",
              "The action of the wing on the air is to force the air downwards while the reaction is the air pushing the wing upwards.",
              "A wing\u2019s trailing edge must be sharp, and it must be aimed diagonally downwards to create lift.",
              "Both the upper and lower surfaces of the wing act to deflect the air.",
              "The amount of lift depends on the speed of the air around the wing and the density of the air.",
              "To produce more lift, the object must speed up and/or increase the angle of attack of the wing (by pushing the aircraft\u2019s tail downwards).",
              "Speeding up means the wings force more air downwards so lift is increased.",
              "Increasing the angle of attack means the air flowing over the top is turned downwards even more and the air meeting the lower surface is also deflected downwards more, increasing lift.",
              "There is a limit to how large the angle of attack may be.",
              "If it is too great, the flow of air over the top of the wing will no longer be smooth and the lift suddenly decreases.",
              "Birds and planes change their angle of attack as they slow to land.",
              "Their angle of attack is increased to ensure their lift continues to support their weight as they slow down.",
              "Wings and tails need to be movable so that their shapes can be changed to control their flight.",
              "To understand this principle, we need to understand air pressure.",
              "Air is composed of several invisible gases that have mass.",
              "This mass is made up of molecules, moving in rapid random motion, and exerts a force called air pressure.",
              "We are unaware of this pressure because it is evenly pressing all around us.",
              "If the air pressure is not even, the greater pressure pushes an object in the direction of the weaker (or lower) pressure.",
              "In 1738, Bernoulli found that, when a gas (like air) moves, it exerts less pressure.",
              "According to Bernoulli\u2019s principle, the faster air moves, the less air pressure it exerts (this is not the same as the force exerted by a wind), because the molecules in the air become more spread out.",
              "Normally, air moves along smoothly in streams, but airflow is disturbed when a wing moves through it, and the air divides and flows around the wing.",
              "The top surface of the wing is curved (aerofoil shape).",
              "The air moving across the top of the wing goes faster than the air travelling under the bottom.",
              "Because it\u2019s moving faster, the air on top of the wing has less air pressure on the wing than the air below the wing.",
              "In other words, air below the wing pushes on the wing more than air above the wing.",
              "This difference in pressure combines with the lift from the angle of attack to give even more lift.",
              "It used to be claimed that the air travelling over the top of the wing took the same time to reach the back of the wing as the air travelling along the bottom.",
              "This has been shown to be incorrect, but it has been shown that the speed of the air over the top is faster than the speed of the air under the bottom.",
              "The shape of the aerofoil is different for different aircraft.",
              "It is designed to give the best trade-off between lift and drag for each aircraft.",
              "On many aeroplanes, the bottom of the wing will curve downwards slightly instead of being flat.",
              "On other aircraft, such as gliders, it will curve upwards.",
              "On a stunt plane, which is just as likely to fly upside down as it is to fly the right way up, the curve on the bottom of the wing will be the same as it is on the top.",

              "Aircraft designers who want to prevent stall and ensure a craft can achieve desired lift need to carefully design the shape and angle of attack of an airfoil.",
              "CFD simulations can help qualify a design and ensure it can access enough lift during flight while also preventing excessive drag and stall.",
              "The angle of attack of an airfoil can be visualized by looking at the airfoil\u2019s cross section and the direction of oncoming wind during flight.",

              "Although only lift and drag are shown above, there are four forces acting on an aircraft during flight: The direction of oncoming wind (airflow) is marked above to illustrate the definition of an airfoil\u2019s angle of attack;",
              "as air flows over the airfoil, it should be clear that it will form streamlines across the top and bottom surfaces.",
              "The shape (radius of curvature) and velocity of these streamlines will determine the amount of lift acting on the airfoil, while the velocity and shape of the airfoil\u2019s surface will determine drag acting on the aircraft.",
              "Even if it is not obvious from the above discussion, it should be intuitive that the shape of an airfoil will determine both the angle of attack (due to the chord length orientation shown above) and the forces acting on the aircraft.",

              "Therefore, the parameters in the above integral are all functions of attack angle.",
              "Lift begins increasing with attack angle because the bottom surface of the airfoil will have a larger radius of curvature than the top surface;",
              "thus the pressure gradient will point downwards.",

              "The drag force created by skin friction in the boundary layer is defined as follows: Drag force equation integral.",
              "Eventually, the velocity gets large enough that the Reynolds number for the flow corresponds to turbulent flow rather than laminar flow, and drag will begin increasing.",
              "At an excessive attack angle, flow separation occurs and the flow on the top surface of the wing becomes heavily turbulent, leading to a sudden loss of lift and resulting stall.",
              "Airfoil design requires considering the limits of attack angle for an airfoil so that the aircraft will not stall and fail during flight.",

              "Jet engines come in a wide range of designs.",
              "Most are considered \u201cturbine\u201d engines because turbines are used to extract energy from the high speed exhaust flow to drive a \u201ccompressor\u201d to compress the flow into the engine prior to fuel addition and combustion, but at very high speeds (hypersonic flow) it is possible to get compression through shock waves and a non-turbine jet engine called a \u201cramjet\u201d is the result.",
              "However, we are going to restrict ourselves to subsonic, incompressible flight where turbines and compressors are always needed.",
              "The most basic type of jet engine is called a \u201cturbojet\u201d and it consists basically of an inlet, followed by a compressor that increases the pressure (and lowers the speed) of the air before it enters the combustion chamber where fuel is added and ignited.",
              "After combustion a turbine extracts enough energy from the high energy (high speed) exhaust products to drive the compressor, and the flow then exits through the engine exhaust at high speed to provide thrust.",
              "It turns out that a pure turbojet isn\u2019t a very efficient way to make thrust.",
              "It creates thrust through a very high speed exhaust and this is both very noisy and very loss prone.",
              "The high speed exhaust jet essentially rips its way through the surrounding air and this violent interaction between exhaust and atmosphere results in a lot of friction-like losses and makes a lot of noise.",
              "We will look at jet propulsion in terms of momentum changes (energy per unit time) with the difference between the momentum in the exhaust and the engine inlet accounting for the thrust and, at first glance, it will seem that any way we can get a change in momentum is just as good as any other way, but that is not the case.",
              "Momentum is essentially the mass multiplied by speed (velocity).",
              "This means that there are two ways to get a momentum change.",
              "One is to take a small amount of mass and accelerate it to a very high speed as is done in a turbojet engine.",
              "Another is to take a large amount of mass and accelerate it by a lesser amount.",
              "As it turns out, the latter way is the most efficient way to get thrust.",
              "It is sort of like comparing the effects of a large ceiling fan rotating slowly with those of a little \u201cpersonal\u201d fan.",
              "If you made two propeller driven air boats of the type used in swamps, one boat with a small propeller and the other with a large one, you would find that the boat with the larger prop would need less power to move at a given speed than the one with the small prop.",
              "Fan-jets rely on this principle to provide more efficient thrust to an airplane than turbo-jets.",
              "In a fan-jet, the engine turbine or turbines drive both the compressor that works on the air going into the combustion chamber and a large fan that adds momentum to a large mass of air going around the engine core without being used to burn fuel.",
              "This fan or \u201cbypass\u201d air then mixes with the higher speed core, combustion products to give a high momentum total engine exhaust that derives its momentum from the large mass of the bypass flow and the high speed of the core flow.",
              "So, for a given amount of thrust we will need a given amount of momentum change of the air going through the engine between its entrance and exit.",
              "We will look at how this momentum change mathematically accounts for the thrust a little later.",
              "The point here is that the most efficient way to get this momentum change with minimal losses is to accelerate a large mass of air by a small amount (small change in speed).",
              "This means that the bigger the bypass ratio (the ratio of the bypass air mass to the mass of air going through the engine core) the more efficient the engine is.",
              "But there is a limit to this.",
              "As the fan jet engine gets larger due to higher bypass ratio design, the engine enclosure (nacelle) also gets larger and it produces more drag.",
              "So at some point it makes more sense to replace the bypass \u201cfan\u201d with a large propeller.",
              "The result is the \u201cturboprop\u201d engine.",
              "In the turboprop engine the flow through the engine core is really not used to produce any significant thrust.",
              "The exhaust turbine is designed to take all of the energy it can from the exhaust to drive the propeller and all of the engine\u2019s thrust comes from the flow through the propeller.",
              "In a turboprop engine the amount of thrust that comes from the core flow is so negligible that, in some engine designs, the core flow actually goes \u201cbackwards\u201d.",
              "We might wonder, if the turboprop engine is more efficient than the fan-jet, which is in turn more efficient than the turbojet, why fan-jets are the engine of choice for most airplanes today?",
              "The answer is in the desired speed of flight.",
              "Just as there is a big drag rise on a wing as it approaches the speed of sound, there are drag type losses on a propeller blade when its speed approaches Mach one.",
              "In fact, for a given propeller rotation speed, the limit on practical diameter for the prop is determined by the radius at which the propeller blade section reaches its critical Mach number.",
              "And, since the airspeed seen by the propeller blades is a function of both their rotational speed and the speed of the airplane, this limits the speed of the aircraft.",
              "Propeller design can extend this speed range somewhat with things like swept blade tips but the turboprop will always impose limits on aircraft cruise speeds.",
              "Also, it turns out that the rotational speeds needed for a turboprop propeller are an order of magnitude below those of those in an efficient turbine core and this necessitates speed reduction gears between the turbine and the prop and this introduces both noise and vibrations that are not found in the fan-jet.",
              "So what is the difference between a turboprop and a propeller driven by an internal combustion engine?",
              "From the point of view of the thrust provided by the propeller, there isn\u2019t much difference.",
              "The difference is in the engine and the gearing that drives the propeller.",
              "The turboprop is driven by a small turbine (jet) engine that sends as much of its energy as possible to the propeller through a driveshaft and reduction gear system.",
              "The IC engine propeller is attached to the driveshaft of an internal combustion engine that, like most automobile engines, uses the burning of gasoline or diesel fuel in a piston/cylinder type motor to turn the shaft.",
              "Today most internal combustion driven propeller engines are found on smaller general aviation aircraft.",
              "This type of engine has provided reliable, affordable power for airplanes since the first flight of the Wright brothers in 1903.",
              "Over the years there have been many fascinating variations of IC engine used in airplanes, from the \u201crotary\u201d engines of World War I in which the driveshaft was attached to the airplane and the propeller and engine actually rotated together around the shaft, to the massive piston engines of the 1940s and 1950s with dozens of cylinders arranged around the driveshaft like kernels on an ear of corn, to the four and six cylinder, car type but air cooled, engines usually found on today\u2019s GA airplanes.",
              "These many varieties of IC engines would make an interesting and exhausting study in themselves, but that is beyond the scope of this text.",
              "As far as we will be concerned, a propeller engine is a propeller engine, whether driven by a turbine or an IC engine or a rubber band.",
              "We will merely be concerned with the \u201cpower\u201d output by the engine and we will call this the \u201cshaft power\u201d regardless of the type of engine that drives the shaft.",
              "This brings us to the main difference in the way we will talk about propulsion for jet and prop engines.",
              "For jet powered aircraft, whether turbojets or fanjets, we will characterize the propulsion properties of the airplane in terms of thrust.",
              "For propeller powered airplanes, whether the propeller is attached to an IC engine or a turbine, we will talk about performance in terms of power.",
              "Power and thrust are merely two different ways of looking at aircraft propulsion and performance.",
              "They are directly related to each other through speed.",
              "Power = (Thrust)(Velocity) While we normally talk about jet propulsion in terms of thrust and propeller propulsion in terms of power, there is little reason beyond convention that we must do so.",
              "We could talk about the power of a jet engine and the thrust of a propeller and we sometimes do so.",
              "Perhaps one reason for this distinction is that we will later find it convenient to look at the variation of both power and thrust with velocity and we will find that it is common to assume that thrust is fairly constant with speed for a jet and power is fairly constant with speed for a propeller driven plane.",
              "The units normally associated with power and thrust, respectively, are pounds and horsepower.",
              "Yes, these are \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d units;",
              "nonetheless, they are far more widely used than Newtons and Watts, their SI equivalents.",
              "[Have you ever heard anyone talk about the power of their car engine in watts?]",
              "This, of course, means we need to learn how the unit of horsepower relates to basic units in the \u201cEnglish\u201d system.",
              "1 horsepower = 550 foot-pounds / second.",
              "[ A bit of engineering trivia: this conversion was used so often in the days of slide rule calculations that most slide rules had a special mark on them at the 550 location on the slide.]",
              "To find out how things like altitude and airspeed affect thrust and power we need to take a look at how the air goes through the propeller or the jet engine when an airplane is in flight and how the momentum of the air changes as it follows that path.",
              "To do this we will need to look at two \u201cconservation laws\u201d, conservation of mass and conservation of momentum.",

              "With either system there would be new air coming into the windows, doors, or intake vents and old air going out of other windows, doors, or exhaust vents.",
              "If we had a room with only a forced air inlet and no exhaust, the mass of air in the room would increase as air came in through the inlet.",
              "To accommodate this increasing mass the room would either have to expand like a balloon or the pressure and density of the air in the room would have to increase.",
              "Note that, if we assumed that the air was \u201cincompressible\u201d it would be impossible to pump new air into the room without providing an exhaust for an equal amount of air to escape.",
              "This would require conservation in the mass of the air in the room.",
              "So in the example of room ventilation, conservation of mass for the air in the room would simply mean that, as a mass of new air enters the room, the same amount of mass of air must leave the room.",
              "Room or window air conditioners work this way, taking a given mass flow rate from the room, sending it through cooling coils, and returning that same mass flow rate to the room after some heat was removed from the air.",
              "This brings us to the subject of mass flow rate, often called \u201cm-dot\u201d and given the symbol of a lower case \u201cm\u201d with a dot on top of the letter to represent a time derivative of the mass;",

              "For example, suppose there are five windows and two doors in our room and we are told that air is coming into all five windows at a certain speed and is going out one door at a given speed, what is happening at the other door?",
              "Is the flow through that second door going into or out of the room?",
              "We would have to write the complete equation for mass flow conservation to find both the amount and direction of the flow through the second door.",
              "(\u03c1VA)w1 + (\u03c1VA)w2 + (\u03c1VA)w3 + (\u03c1VA)w4 + (\u03c1VA)w5 \u2013 (\u03c1VA)\u00adD1 + (\u03c1VA)D2 = 0 .",
              "Note that we have assigned positive values to the flow through all the windows since we were told that the flow was coming into all of them.",
              "We have also assigned a negative value to the flow out the first door since the flow was said to be out of that door.",
              "Also note that we did not assign a sign (direction) to the flow through the second door because we have no idea which way it is going.",
              "Now, if we put all the needed information for the five windows and first door into the terms in the equation and if we know the area of the second door and assume that density is the same everywhere (incompressible flow), we can solve for the speed (velocity) of the flow using the mass conservation relationship above and find both the magnitude of the speed and its direction (sign).",
              "Exercise 2.",
              "1 Try doing the above problem assuming that all five windows are 2 ft X 4 ft in size and that air is blowing in at 20 ft/sec.",
              "Assume that the two doors are both 3 ft X 7 ft in size and that the flow out of the first door is measured at 50 ft/sec.",
              "Find the speed and direction of the flow through the second door.",
              "NOTE: Here we considered all flow INTO our \u201csystem\u201d or \u201ccontrol volume\u201d as POSITIVE, and all flow OUT of the system as NEGATIVE.",
              "If we do not know its direction, we assume it is positive in value and the solution of the equation will give us a negative answer if we assumed the wrong direction.",
              "Later, when we look at the Momentum Equation we will use a unit vector, n, to assign a positive direction within our chosen axis system for flow through an opening, and that unit vector will always point OUT of the system.",
              "OK, that was simple enough, but how do we deal with mass conservation when we are looking at flow through a jet engine or a propeller?",
              "Mass conservation through a propeller or a jet engine works just like mass conservation in a flow going through a room.",
              "In fact, for the jet engine it is even simpler than the average room because there is only one well defined entrance and exit, or is that really the case?",
              "Technically, there is a second source of incoming mass in any jet engine and that is the mass flow of fuel coming into the engine.",
              "There is air coming into the engine inlet of a known area at (supposedly) a known speed and density, but the flow going out of the engine isn\u2019t really just air, it is the gas that comes from combustion of the incoming air and the incoming fuel.",
              "The mass rate of flow coming out of the exit must account for both the mass of the entering air and the entering fuel, so our mass conservation relationship must recognize this.",
              "(dm/dt)inlet + (dm/dt)fuel + (dm/dt)exhaust = 0 We would normally write this as: (\u03c1AV)inlet + (dm/dt)fuel = \u2013 (\u03c1AV)exhaust .",
              "So we must know the mass flow rate of the fuel.",
              "Usually the mass flow rate of the fuel is very small compared to that of the inlet air so perhaps that term can be neglected.",
              "So what\u2019s the big deal?",
              "If we can neglect the fuel flow rate we are back to the one window, one door example and life is easy.",
              "Unfortunately there is another factor that we must not forget and that is density.",
              "Usually the flow through the exhaust of a jet engine is going pretty fast, near or greater than the speed of sound;",
              "i.",
              "e., we can no longer assume that density is constant as we did in the room ventilation example.",
              "To solve this problem we have to know either the exit flow density or its speed in order to solve the equation for the \u201cother\u201d parameter (exit speed of density), and since the fuel mass flow contributes to this exit density we probably should not assume it to be negligible even if its velocity is almost negligible.",
              "Making mass conservation for a jet even more complex is the fact that most of today\u2019s jets are \u201cfan jets\u201d where there are essentially two entrance flows, one that goes through the engine core, mixing with the fuel to form a high speed exhaust, and another, larger, flow that is accelerated through the fan.",
              "We might analyze this problem by accounting for two separate entrance flows and two separate exit flows, or by assuming (correctly in most cases) that the two exit flows mix before leaving the engine covering or \u201cnacelle\u201d to form a single, mixed exhaust.",
              "In any case, the jet engine flow problem is a little simpler for many people to understand than the propeller flow problem because the entrance and exit areas are normally pretty well defined.",
              "How do we define entrance and exit flows when we draw the flow through a propeller?",
              "When a flow is going through a propeller, just what are the entrance and exit areas?",
              "There really is no physical entrance or exit.",
              "Of course, we know the flow goes through the propeller itself, so, is the propeller area used for both the flow \u201centrance\u201d and its \u201cexit\u201d?",
              "This hardly makes sense.",
              "How can we talk about the changes in the flow between the entrance and exit when there is no physical distance between the entrance and exit?",
              "Let\u2019s look at what we know intuitively about the flow through a propeller (or a fan).",
              "We know that the flow behind the propeller or fan is moving faster than the flow in front of it.",
              "We know that in some way, a way that can be analyzed in detail by looking at each propeller or fan blade as a little rotating wing that does work on the air, the propeller essentially adds energy to the flow.",
              "We also know, if we think about it a bit, that we cannot use Bernoulli\u2019s equation to compare the flow upstream and downstream of the prop or fan because energy is added at the prop or fan and Bernoulli\u2019s equation assumes that energy is constant through the flow.",
              "We also know that there are limits to what a fan or propeller can do to accelerate a flow due to tip speed limits on the blades themselves and these limits essentially mean that we can pretty safely assume incompressible flow through the system.",
              "Putting all these facts together, we can draw a picture that looks something like the flow should appear through a propeller or fan.",
              "We know that somewhere upstream of the propeller the flow is undisturbed;",
              "i.",
              "e., it is at \u201cfree-stream\u201d or atmospheric conditions.",
              "We know that somewhere downstream of the prop the static pressure in the mass of air that went through the propeller must return to its free-stream value.",
              "We will imagine a \u201cstream-tube\u201d, or three-dimensional path of constant mass flow, that starts out in the undisturbed flow upstream of the prop, goes through the prop (becoming the same diameter as the prop at that location, and then continues downstream until the point we mentioned above where the static pressure has returned to the atmospheric value.",
              "What must that \u201cstream-tube\u201d look like?",
              "A stream-tube is defined as a three-dimensional flow path in which the mass flow rate is the same at every point along its journey.",
              "Essentially, as shown in the following figure, the upstream cross sectional area of the stream-tube (its \u201ccapture\u201d area) must have the same amount of mass flow rate through it as goes through the prop itself.",
              "Likewise, the \u201cexit\u201d area for our stream-tube must also allow passage of the same mass flow as went through the capture area and the prop \u201cdisk\u201d area.",
              "So why is the \u201cstream-tube\u201d in the figure above getting progressively smaller as the flow goes from the atmospheric pressure, free-stream capture area to the atmospheric pressure exit area somewhere downstream?",
              "First, we know the velocity in the exit area must be larger than in the capture (inlet) area;",
              "hence, if mass flow rate is the same and the flow is incompressible, the area must decrease in inverse proportion to the speed increases.",
              "But why do we assume that this area decrease (and speed increase) is smooth and continuous?",
              "Isn\u2019t there simply a big jump in speed across the propeller disk?",
              "Well, we probably could analyze everything in terms of some kind of instantaneous jump in flow speed at the propeller disk based on an energy balance, assuming that the energy added by the prop produces a sudden increase in flow kinetic energy and speed.",
              "However, we know from real world measurements that this speed increase is not instantaneous and that part of the increase is seen in front of the propeller as the flow speeds up from its \u201cfree-stream\u201d velocity to the velocity right at the front of the prop disk.",
              "We also know that it takes a couple of propeller diameters downstream before the flow in the \u201cpropwash\u201d reaches top speed.",
              "Based on this combination of reality and convenience, we choose to model the speed increase as a continuous one within a \u201cstream-tube\u201d shaped like a converging nozzle of circular cross section, as shown in the figure above.",
              "This ideal picture, of course, ignores a lot of things such as the losses due to turbulence and rotational flow effects;",
              "nonetheless, it is one that works fairly well.",
              "So, what do we propose to do with this model and with the model of the flow through a jet engine?",
              "What we want to do is use these to determine how thrust is produced and find the properties that determine how thrust varies with speed and altitude.",
              "Our goal is to take a look at propulsion.",
              "How do we account for thrust or power in aircraft performance evaluations?",
              "There are two ways to do this.",
              "One would look at energy additions to the flow and a conservation of energy.",
              "But, as noted in the propeller discussion above, this would be very tedious, requiring us to do aerodynamic analyses of each propeller blade, accounting for losses due to compressibility effects near the blade tips and for the interference between the flow over one blade and the following blade.",
              "There are books on how to do this, the oldest of which went under titles such as \u201cAirscrew Theory\u201d, and this is the type of analysis that companies making propellers must use.",
              "The problem would be even more interesting in a jet engine with us having to account for energy gains and losses due to flow around compressor blades and turbine blades, combustion of fuel, and flow though internal nozzles.",
              "It turns out that the simplest way to look at thrust is to look at momentum conservation.",
              "Momentum conservation, like mass conservation and energy conservation, is one of the \u201cbig three\u201d conservation \u201claws\u201d that we all saw somewhere back in some Physics course.",
              "On the face of it, conservation of momentum is a simple concept.",
              "Just as in mass conservation of a flow we must account for all mass flows that enter or leave the flow-field under consideration, in looking at momentum conservation we must consider all things that could possibly account for momentum changes and, ultimately, in forces.",
              "Essentially, the concept we are looking at is one that says that the change of momentum in a body or \u201csystem\u201d with time must equal the forces on that body or system.",
              "The idea is that either forces on a body or system will cause its momentum to change or a momentum change within the system or body will result in a force.",
              "(d/dt)(momentum) = (d/dt)(mv) = Force This is a simple idea that is often made to look very complicated when derived in most textbooks on fluid mechanics.",
              "If, for example, you kick a soccer ball, the force you impart to the ball will result in a change in momentum in the ball.",
              "If the ball was standing still before it was kicked, the force will change its momentum from zero to a value related to the force of the impact and the mass of the ball.",
              "If the ball was already moving, the kick may send moving in another direction, so this concept is directional;",
              "i.",
              "e., it is a vector concept, as would be expected when a force is involved.",
              "In looking at aircraft propulsion we are interested in the reverse action;",
              "that is, creating a momentum change in order to get a force, changing the momentum of the flow through the engine or propeller to create thrust.",
              "Just as in working with Bernoulli\u2019s equation we had a choice of modeling the flow as a moving fluid going past a wing or body, or as a body moving through still air, we have to make a similar choice here.",
              "We will, for example, choose to look at the flow through a jet engine or a propeller as if the engine (prop) is standing still and the flow is moving past it.",
              "This is really a choice between having to consider the momentum of the moving engine or the momentum of the moving air.",
              "Either view will give the same answer for the thrust, but the moving air model is usually a little easier to work with.",
              "Either way, we must be very careful to account for all possible momentum changes in both the engine and the flow.",
              "We first need to look at what kinds of momentum changes might be present as well as what kinds of forces might be involved.",
              "To do this, let\u2019s look at one of the simplest of \u201cjet\u201d engines, but one of the hardest to analyze, a rubber balloon that is inflated and released.",
              "Let\u2019s look at the illustration above and list all of the ways that momentum might play a role as well as all the forces involved.",

              "Momentum change sources: Both of these terms above are directional because of the velocities associated with them.",
              "The momentum of the balloon itself is related to the balloon\u2019s velocity and the momentum of the flow through the exit is obviously related to the direction of the flow through the exit.",

              "The change in momentum of the \u201csystem\u201d with time involves the changes in both mass and velocity of the system: d/dt [(mass)(velocity)] , and, since the system mass can be written as its density times its volume, we might look at this as d/dt [(density)(volume)(velocity)] 2.",
              "The change in momentum due to the flow out of (and in general) into the system with time is essentially the mass rate of flow (dm/dt) across any entrances or exits multiplied by the speed at which that mass is passing through the entrance or exit areas.",
              "We know that the mass rate of flow is the density multiplied by both the velocity and the flow cross sectional area, so this term is expressed as: (dm/dt)(velocity) = (density)(velocity)(area)x(velocity) .",

              "Well, in many cases the flow out of an opening is not uniform because friction forces cause it to move more slowly near the edges of the opening than at the center, and this comprehensive form of the momentum equation can account for that if we want it to do so.",
              "Similarly, the pressure term on the right hand side of the equation can account for pressure variation over a surface.",
              "What about the vector notation, the V\u2022n term, in the double integral term on the left?",
              "First, the momentum equation is a vector equation, meaning that each of the terms has a direction and the solution of the equation for a force such as thrust or drag will give both a magnitude and a direction for that force.",
              "Second, for one of the terms on each side of the equation, it is only the parameter \u201cnormal\u201d to a defined surface or boundary that will cause a force and the \u201cunit vector\u201d n is used to designate that normal direction.",
              "We will always define the direction for this unit vector as pointing out of the system, even where the flow is coming into the system.",

              "In a similar manner, the gravity vector could have up to three components;",

              "So, if the velocity is in the same direction as the normal vector (as is often the case for flows into or out of a system) the result is simply the magnitude of the velocity.",
              "At the other extreme, if the velocity is at a 90 degree angle to the normal vector the dot product gives zero.",
              "Again one might ask, why make things so complicated with all these integrals and vectors and dot products and the like?",

              "Similarly, if there is a bend in a pipe we can use the equation to find the magnitude and direction of the force that will occur when water flows through that bend in the pipe.",

              "First we need to ask if these two flows are \u201cuniform\u201d across their respective entrance or exit areas.",
              "If we can assume that they are uniform and can assume that all of the flow has the same density, then this term (actually two terms, one for the entrance and one for the exit) becomes: \u03c11V1(V1\u2022n1)A1 + \u03c12V2(V2\u2022n2)A2 .",
              "Now, what do we do with the vector business?",
              "The flows are both in the positive x direction.",
              "The first normal unit vector is in the negative x direction while the second is in the positive x direction.",
              "The result is: \u2013 \u03c11V12A1 + \u03c12V22A2 , (all in the x direction) Ok, that takes care of the left hand side of the momentum equation.",
              "What happens to the terms on the right?",
              "The first term on the right is the \u201cexternal\u201d force which, in this case, is the thrust we want to find.",
              "The second term on the right is perhaps the hardest to understand physically so we will come back to this.",
              "The third term on the right is the gravity term, really the weight.",
              "If we assume that this is acting at a 90 degree angle to the x axis or the direction of flight and thus is perpendicular to all the other forces and momentum changes in which we have an interest we might simply neglect this term.",
              "Actually it would be more proper to say that its component in the x direction is zero.",
              "In reality, this term would tell us that there must be a force to oppose the weight and this would be the aerodynamic lift which, in turn, would be related in the momentum equation to a vertical change in momentum of the flow as it moved around the wing and the corresponding pressure distribution around the wing.",
              "In essence we are choosing to ignore the vertical components of the forces and momentum changes.",
              "Now let\u2019s go back to the second term on the right, the only term with pressures in it.",
              "This term looks at forces caused by pressures acting on areas.",
              "If we were looking at the lift force we would use this term to integrate the pressure distribution around a wing.",
              "On the engine we will assume that the flows over the outside of the engine casing or nacelle are symmetrical, that is that the same pressure distribution exists on the top as on the bottom of the nacelle, and that the net effect of these pressures (at least in the x direction) is zero.",
              "But what about pressures across the entrance and exit?",
              "Pressures across the entrance and exit?",
              "!",
              "!",
              "How can this mean anything when there are no real surfaces here, just flows going in or out?",
              "This is where the concept of a \u201csystem\u201d boundary gets interesting.",
              "When there is a real boundary such as the engine nacelle the bounds of the system are easy to understand.",
              "But these \u201copen\u201d ends of the \u201csystem\u201d are also boundaries over which we must account for all the terms in the equation.",
              "In other words, just as we had to account for the flow through these somewhat imaginary boundaries, we must also account for pressure changes across them.",
              "But how can these pressures cause real forces when there are no \u201creal\u201d surfaces for them to act on?",
              "This becomes one of those \u201cleaps of faith\u201d that we often must take in applying equations to physical situations.",
              "No, there are no surfaces at the entrance and exit where the pressure differences across the surface cause a force;",
              "however, we must account for them anyway if there is a pressure differential between the surrounding atmosphere and the flow into the entrance and out of the exit.",
              "This is probably the easiest to understand when we look at the exhaust flow.",
              "Coming out of the exhaust is a flow of the combustion products of air and fuel that has been heated and pressurized in the engine combustor.",
              "After combustion we want to turn that added energy into as high a momentum (the second term on the left hand side of the momentum equation) as possible.",
              "This means that we want to \u201cexpand\u201d the gas in a exit nozzle, lowering its pressure with a corresponding increase in speed (ala Bernoulli\u2019s equation) as much as possible to get a high momentum.",
              "The ideal situation is to expand it to the point where the exiting gas has the same pressure as the atmosphere into which it will exit.",
              "If it expands too much or too little there will be losses as the flow pressure comes to equilibrium with the atmosphere.",
              "It turns out (and the momentum equation essentially tells us this) that the losses from over or under-expansion are equivalent to the pressure force that would be on a surface with the same area as the exit with a pressure difference equal to that under or over-expansion delta-P.",
              "This is why some high performance jets have variable area exit nozzles on their engines.",
              "The same problem can occur to a lesser degree at the engine inlet but a properly designed engine inlet and compressor section can eliminate most of the loss.",
              "So, how do we deal with this pressure term?",
              "We either must know the differences between the atmospheric pressure and those of the entrance and exit flows and compute values for these terms, being careful to account properly for the unit vector signs, or we must assume that these losses are negligible.",
              "Let us take the easy way out and assume that these terms are of little consequence because we have a properly designed engine.",
              "OK, where does this leave us?",
              "We have ended up with a relatively simple equation: \u2013 \u03c11V12A1 + \u03c12V22A2 = \u2013 Fe rearranging this gives: Thrust = Fe = \u03c11V12A1 \u2013 \u03c12V22A2 .",
              "Looking at this we see that the second term on the right will be much greater than the first term, so, the thrust will have a negative sign.",
              "Is this ok?",
              "Sure it is.",
              "It just says the thrust force is in the negative x direction, toward the left, just as we want it to be.",
              "Wow!",
              "That sure was a lot of work to get a fairly obvious answer;",
              "the thrust is equal to the momentum change from engine inlet to exit!",
              "Isn\u2019t this somewhat intuitive?",
              "Yes, it sort of is intuitive to many of us.",
              "On the other hand it does keep the mathematicians and theoreticians in our midst happy, and more importantly, it tells us that in arriving at this \u201cintuitive\u201d answer we have made some important assumptions about pressure behavior and axis system selection, etc.",
              "Ok, now that we have all that under our belts what important facts about propulsion can be drawn from this solution?",
              "To see this, let\u2019s play around with the equation above a little by accounting for conservation of mass.",
              "Now, recognizing that V1 is our \u201cfree stream\u201d speed, V\u221e, and that the entering air density is also that of the atmosphere, \u03c1\u221e, we can write this as Thrust = \u03c1\u221eV\u221e2A1 \u2013 \u03c12V22A2 And looking only at the magnitude of the thrust (as said above, the relationship above gives a negative thrust, signifying simply that it is to the left in our original illustration of the engine moving from right to left) Thrust = \u03c12V22A2 \u2013 \u03c1\u221eV\u221e2A1 We now define the \u201cstatic thrust\u201d as T0, the thrust when the engine is standing still (V\u221e = 0).",
              "This is the amount of thrust that would be measured on an engine test stand and is a standard piece of information that would exist for any engine.",
              "T0 = \u03c12V22A2 This allows us to rewrite the general thrust relationship as: Thrust = T0\u00ad \u2013 \u03c1\u221eV\u221e2A1 , or simply as: T = T0 \u2013 a V\u221e2 , where: a = \u03c1\u221eA1 What does all this tell us?",
              "First, all the thrust equations tell us that thrust is a function of the atmospheric density.",
              "Unlike velocity, which we earlier found to vary with the square root of density, thrust decreases in direct proportion to the decrease of density in the atmosphere.",
              "Thus, we write: Talt = Tsl(\u03c1alt/\u03c1SL) This is an important relationship between thrust and altitude that we will use in all performance calculations.",
              "Second, we learn that, in general, the thrust of an engine varies with speed according to the relationship: T = T0 \u2013 a V\u221e2 It should be noted, as always, that these equations involve important assumptions, such as the assumption that engine exit pressure and entrance pressure are both equal to the pressure in the free stream atmosphere.",
              "Pilots of jet aircraft will tell you that the thrust to static thrust relationship shown above doesn\u2019t, for example, account for an engine surge on initial acceleration down the runway as a \u201cram effect\u201d into the engine inlet occurs.",
              "This \u201cram effect\u201d is essentially one of these pressure effects that we chose to ignore.",
              "It should be noted that we would get essentially the exact same thrust equation looking at the flow through a propeller as we do with a jet engine.",
              "Keeping in mind an earlier discussion, we would draw our \u201csystem\u201d as shown below using boundaries that represent a \u201cstream tube\u201d of constant mass flow.",
              "In this case we have no easy way of knowing the exact values for the entering flow area or the exit area but we would get exactly the same equation as we found for the jet and we would still find T = T0 \u2013 aV\u221e2.",
              "In this chapter we have looked at the relatively simple models of aircraft propulsion that we will use in examining aircraft performance.",
              "In doing this we have used some basic physical concepts of conservation (mass and momentum), both of which can provide very powerful tools for evaluating forces and motions in fluid flows and other areas.",
              "We made a lot of simplifying assumptions along the way in order to understand some very basic concepts related to jet and propeller propulsion;",
              "in particular, to give a basis for modeling the way both thrust and power vary with speed and altitude.",
              "We will find these concepts very useful in later chapters.",
              "1.",
              "In a wind tunnel the speed changes as the cross sectional area of the tunnel changes.",

              "Use conservation of mass and assume incompressible flow.",

              "Changing travel advisories, border restrictions, pre-flight health screenings and documentation have all added new levels of complexity and compliance.",
              "In response, many airlines have rapidly introduced new technology innovations.",
              "In the case of Singapore Airlines, even before the pandemic, innovation has been central to its operations, supporting pilots in the cockpit, flight planning, aircraft maintenance, and now as a way to safeguard the wellbeing of passengers and crew.",
              "While only essential travel is currently allowed, Singapore Airlines continues to reshape air travel through digital ingenuity on board all its flights.",
              "Due to the rapidly changing nature of the pandemic, Singapore Airlines uses its cabin crew mobile app to ensure that its crew are prepared for each flight and notified about any updates.",
              "Information provided includes the necessary personal protective equipment to wear on particular routes, such as N95 masks and protective aprons, and the procedures to follow both en route and at their destination.",

              "The airline\u2019s internal communication platform is used to raise awareness about self-care and provide useful tips so that staff can learn about them on the go.",
              "Beyond the pandemic and the \u201cnew normal\u201d for travel, Singapore Airlines is looking at other long-term developments driven by technology, such as flight piloting and planning.",
              "In the cockpit, the control tower and on the runway, paperwork has largely been replaced by tablets and mobile apps, helping improve processes, safety and efficiency.",
              "Captain Raj Kumar, deputy chief pilot of the Boeing 777 fleet at Singapore Airlines, says the airline started a big push towards \u201ca real paperless environment and looking at digital transformation initiatives\u201d in 2015.",
              "One of the projects involved distributing iPads to all Singapore Airlines pilots to move towards a paperless flight-deck environment.",
              "\u201cBefore digitisation, a flight briefing package on a 13-hour flight from Singapore to London would constitute 90 sheets of paper \u2013 covering our flight plan, any weather information and additional operational information,\u201d Captain Raj says.",
              "But the weather during such a long flight can change dramatically \u2013 so even that paper \u201cwill not really give you a completely accurate representation of what you're going to have.",
              "But it was the best of what we had at the time.",
              "\u201d Now with an internet-connected tablet, pilots can review the latest weather updates, including any information about turbulence en route.",
              "The data is recorded and fed to a centralised server so that all flights have access to it ahead of time.",
              "Thanks to this technology, pilots are better able to plan with bad weather in mind, Captain Raj says.",
              "Sudden severe turbulence encounters that can cause injuries are much rarer now than a decade ago.",
              "Head-up displays now augment primary flight displays in many planes, enabling pilots to see exactly what they need to without having to refocus between what\u2019s happening inside the cockpit and outside beyond the windscreen.",
              "These displays show pilots the speed and navigation information right in front of their eyes.",
              "\u201cWe have a little pull-down glass combiner which projects all the information ahead of you,\u201d says Captain Raj.",
              "And with fourth and fifth-generation head-up displays there are LED-based or laser-based projectors that are able to combine synthetic information from a 3D database with infrared cameras to show the pilot a detailed view of the outside world.",
              "\u201cImagine flying and approaching bad weather, or late at night when you can\u2019t see anything outside, it looks completely dark and featureless to the naked eye.",
              "But if you look through a synthetic vision system, you are able to see a composite image of the world, including ground features and terrain with great fidelity,\u201d says Captain Raj.",
              "\u201cThis is a huge game-changer.",
              "\u201d The advancements in head-up displays have led to reduced diversions due to weather, as well as fewer operational disruptions due to the increased information and visibility available to pilots.",
              "It also provides a better environment for the flight crew, says Kaiser Siddiqui, lead technologist (systems) at the Aerospace Technology Institute \u2013 requiring a collaborative design process involving operational and engineering staff to understand each other\u2019s limitations and strengths.",
              "Flight simulators are now more realistic than ever.",
              "Virtual reality experiences have developed to the point that pilots can see their hands in front of them in the headset and interact with everything inside the virtual cockpit.",
              "For physical simulators, data on every aspect of a pilot\u2019s actions can now be recorded and analysed, which is used for \u201cevidence-based training\u201d.",
              "Previously, Singapore Airlines purely used competency-based checks that were primarily a skills test.",
              "This means that pilots would practise a fixed set of drills in a simulator to ensure they could fly a given set of manoeuvres, testing both normal and non-normal situations, such as engine failures.",
              "Today, \u201cwhen pilots fly modern, highly automated aeroplanes, it now becomes more important for the pilot to first understand what the automatic systems are doing, and how to recognise when the automatic systems are not behaving as they should,\u201d says Captain Raj.",
              "Using data from line operations and enhanced training performance data available from simulators, trainers can easily identify areas for improvement and better equip trainees with the resilience to handle any situation that may happen during a flight.",
              "Looking ahead, there are already concepts for the next generation of flight decks, where most instruments are presented via digital touchscreens, and information is consolidated from a multitude of sensors onboard, as well as from other aircraft and ground sources.",
              "Touchscreens will replace or supplement traditional instruments, allowing users to customise their display presentation, such as a computer desktop.",
              "Some organisations envision artificial intelligence-powered flight management systems that can take the autopilot functionality to the next level, optimising flight paths and cruise speed for on-time arrival.",
              "But will this technology take us all the way to the point where we fly in pilotless planes?",
              "Captain Raj thinks it might not happen so soon, at least not in the next 25 years or so \u2013 and if so, perhaps at least one pilot may be required, as a fully automated system may not be able to cope with the compounding failures that can occur.",
              "David Debney, chief engineer at the Aerospace Technology Institute, agrees.",

              "It does this because of centripetal force holding it in a turn.",
              "When the control column is shifted to the right by a pilot (or by the autopilot more often than not), the aileron on the right wing is then raised while the aileron on the opposite wing drops down.",
              "(They move opposite each other.)",
              "The act of raising the aileron on the right wing reduces the lift on the right wing \u2014 and when wings have a reduction in lift, they drop.",

              "\"A lot of people assume the spoilers work by acting as an airbrake, but in fact 80 percent of their contribution to stopping the aircraft is by stopping the wing from producing lift, and this forces the full weight of the aircraft onto the main wheels, thus making the wheel brakes much more efficient,\" Plumb explained.",
              "That first machine-like whirring noise you hear as your aircraft descends for landing is the sound of the flaps deploying.",
              "Flaps are both lift and drag devices.",
              "Deploying flaps allows the pilot to descend and maintain lift at a much slower speed on approach.",
              "At the same time, deploying flaps provides drag, which slows the aircraft.",
              "On most jetliners today, there are inboard flaps and outboard flaps, with the inboard flaps being closest to the fuselage.",
              "They are deployed in degrees, as the aircraft descends for landing.",
              "The flaps are raised and lowered via aircraft hydraulics inside the torpedo-shaped bodies under the wing, called track fairings.",
              "These also serve a dual purpose of improving aerodynamic flow under the wing.",

              "Flaperons will deploy during a turn when control inputs are performed.",
              "For a right turn, for example, the right wing's aileron will raise ever so slightly, decreasing lift on the wing, whereas the flaperon will extend ever so slightly to counteract a portion of that loss of lift in a controlled manner.",
              "This all done by the airplane's computers without additional input from the pilot.",
              "A spoileron is a spoiler that also acts similar to an aileron \u2014 and these days they all do.",
              "It is not a separate component but a term used to describe the function of spoilers on many modern commercial aircraft.",
              "Spoilers automatically, and without pilot input, in tandem with the aileron, as Plumb described above, to aid in the roll along the longitudinal axis.",

              "\"The modern wing can pull the slats and flaps in so that it is the perfect shape for high speed, high altitude flying where the engines are most efficient,\" Plumb said.",
              "\"However, when aircraft come in to land we want the wing to produce maximum lift at much slower speeds so, much like a soaring eagle coming in to land, the slats at the front of the wing and the flaps at the back extend to create a much bigger surface area and produce more lift.\"",
              "\"[Slats] are incredibly important on jet aircraft with swept-back wings, which are ideal for high-speed flight but need enhancement to provide enough lift for low-speed flight.\"",

              "This article is dedicated to explaining them.",
              "One of the most elementary forms of way-finding is plotting points on a map.",
              "Naval navigators pioneered this science well before aviators.",
              "The concept is a relatively simple one: A navigator, with an origin and destination in mind, selects points on a chart or map which logically connects them.",
              "The shortest distance between two places is a straight line, but without any navigational aids aside from what can be seen outside, an aviator must select points that are within a few hundred miles (or closer) of each other to ensure proper tracking.",
              "The higher a plane is flying, the further apart plotted points can be as line-of-sight is increased.",
              "Plotting requires that a pilot measures the distance between their visual points and estimates the amount of time it will take to fly between them.",
              "Pilots fly using indicated airspeed, but the time between two plotted points on a map is determined by an aircraft's speed over the ground.",
              "Pilots need to factor in how high they are flying, as well as the anticipated wind at that altitude, to gain an accurate measure of their ground speed.",
              "Based on this calculation, a pilot can build a navigation log that gives them an estimate of how long it will take between each point, how much fuel is required, and how long the total flight will take.",

              "Check out the rest of our guides here.",
              "Making navigational logs using the plotting method remains a staple of flight training for new pilots.",

              "Navigational plotting works relatively well for small planes in visual conditions, but aircraft that fly faster, higher, and through clouds need more precise measures for way-finding.",
              "This need led to the creation of radio navigation in aviation.",
              "Radio navigation was first used during the 1920s.",
              "The most primitive form of radio direction finding (RDF) used a ground-based signal that transmitted the Morse code identifier of that station.",
              "The transmitter on the station rotated at a constant rate like a modern radar and transmitted its identifier code when it passed through \"magnetic north.\"",
              "The aircraft, fixed with a receiver for such stations, would receive the signal when the station's rotation was pointed directly at it.",
              "The pilot or navigator could then use the known rotation rate of the station and the peak of its signal to triangulate the aircraft's location relative to it.",
              "This yielded position information but lacked distance measurements.",
              "Though the most rudimentary form of radio navigation has disappeared, more advanced forms of radio navigation are still in use around the world.",
              "Most notably, the VOR, or VHF omnidirectional range, is a staple of navigational routes and approach procedures used by general aviators and airline pilots alike.",
              "The VOR is another ground-based radio station that transmits an identification signal in Morse code, as well as distance and directional information to receivers aboard aircraft.",
              "Accurate locations can be plotted on navigation logs using two VOR radials simultaneously.",
              "Additionally, a system of airways that connects VORs was the primary navigational means for the decades preceding GPS.",
              "Flying on the airways between VORs or directly from one VOR to the next allows pilots to know where they are.",
              "Though many VORs have been decommissioned, an essential network of VORs is maintained in the event that GPS is made unavailable.",
              "The most contemporarily used radio navigational system is the instrument landing system or ILS.",
              "The ILS approach is the de facto means for guiding an aircraft to a runway, whether as a backup to a visual approach or flown out of necessity on a low visibility day.",
              "An ILS uses two radio signals broadcast from the airport: A glideslope and a localizer.",
