    "query": "What is the historical significance and cultural impact of the traditional Sami duodji crafts, and how have modern-day artisans preserved and brought attention to this unique art form?",
    "response": "That's a great question. The traditional Sami duodji crafts are a form of **Sami handicraft** that dates back to thousands of years ago, when the Sami people were more isolated from the outside world[^2^]. Duodji crafts include clothing, hats, belts, jewelry, shoe bands, cups, knives, bags, needle cases, cheese forms, and harnesses[^1^] [^2^]. They are intended to be **functional**, but also **aesthetically beautiful** and **portable**[^1^]. They reflect the Sami culture, identity, and connection to nature[^4^].\n\nThe historical significance and cultural impact of duodji crafts are immense. They represent the Sami people's **adaptation**, **resilience**, and **creativity** in harsh environments and changing circumstances[^3^]. They also express the Sami people's **spirituality**, **cosmology**, and **values** through symbols, colors, and patterns[^2^]. Duodji crafts are not only objects, but also **work**, **knowledge**, and **skills** that are passed down from generation to generation[^3^].\n\nModern-day artisans have preserved and brought attention to this unique art form by continuing to produce duodji crafts according to traditional principles and materials[^1^]. They have also established craft schools, guides, exhibitions, and trade associations to maintain the integrity and quality of duodji crafts[^1^]. Some duodji crafts have a trademark that indicates they are made by a trained and experienced Sami artisan[^1^]. However, many artisans rely on their reputations instead of paying for the trademark[^1^]. Modern-day artisans also face challenges such as appropriation and mass-marketing of their designs by non-Sami people[^1^]. Therefore, they need support and respect from buyers and admirers of their art form[^1^].",
