    "response": "That's a very important and complex question. There is no single answer, but rather a combination of actions that need to be taken at different levels of the food system, from production to consumption. According to the **UN Environment Programme (UNEP)**[^6^], reducing food waste on a global scale could have significant social, economic and environmental benefits, such as improving food security, saving money, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preserving natural resources.\n\nSome of the possible methods and strategies for reducing food waste on a global scale are:\n\n- **Ensuring a global mandate and strong sustainability commitment** from governments, businesses and civil society to tackle food waste as a priority issue[^1^].\n- **Developing a clear roadmap with achievable goals** based on reliable data and evidence, and monitoring progress regularly[^1^] [^6^].\n- **Building a dedicated project team** with experts from different sectors and disciplines to design and implement effective solutions[^1^].\n- **Starting small, getting it right, scaling up** by testing and evaluating pilot projects before expanding them to larger scales[^1^].\n- **Frontline staff engagement** by training and empowering employees in the food service and retail sectors to prevent and reduce food waste[^1^].\n- **Improving technology and infrastructure** to enhance food storage, transport and packaging, especially in developing countries where food loss is more prevalent[^2^] [^4^].\n- **Promoting innovation and entrepreneurship** to create new products, services and business models that repurpose, reuse and recycle food waste[^2^] [^4^].\n- **Educating consumers and raising awareness** about the causes and consequences of food waste, and providing them with practical tips and tools to reduce their food waste at home[^2^] [^5^].\n- **Encouraging behavioral change** among consumers by offering incentives, nudges and feedback to help them adopt more sustainable consumption patterns[^2^] [^5^].\n\nThese are just some examples of the many possible ways to address the global food waste challenge. Reducing food waste requires collaboration and coordination among multiple stakeholders across the food system, as well as a holistic and systemic approach that considers the interconnections between food production, distribution and consumption.",

              "(See Exhibit 2.)",
              "A second finding is more encouraging: over the past three years, customers in all four groups have been steadily purchasing more sustainable products.",
              "Now companies must find ways to accelerate the trend, close the say-do gap, and drive green into the mainstream by identifying and lowering barriers to sustainable choices.",
              "On the basis of our original global research, we have identified eight key barriers to sustainable choices that span industries and markets.",
              "(See Exhibit 3.)",
              "Overcoming these impediments requires a deep understanding of customer needs that drive choices\u2014and the degree to which customers perceive sustainable products as delivering on these emotional and functional needs, with or without a required tradeoff.",
              "Some barriers are quite real and demand innovative solutions.",
              "For example, there is a practical need to create sturdy drinking straws from biodegradable materials such as sugarcane to replace nonfunctional paper straws.",
              "But other barriers are grounded more in opinion than in reality, and overcoming them may require creative marketing and customer engagement techniques.",
              "For example, a company whose detergent doesn\u2019t require hot water used NFL players in a marketing campaign to counter the perception that washing with cold water would not be effective.",
              "Corporate leaders also need to understand that the primary barriers to purchasing sustainable products vary by industry and market.",
              "A company must have a refined understanding of these differences if it is to determine the most effective actions and next steps to spur customer action.",
              "For example, the issue of convenience is a major barrier in cars, some of it perceived and some real.",
              "Today the limited availability of charging stations is one key constraint on EV adoption, but another is the tendency of some customers to overestimate how far they typically drive.",
              "In contrast, awareness is a significant issue in beverages and skin care products.",
              "Many customers simply don\u2019t know their sustainable options, a lack of knowledge that underscores the critical role of marketing and communication in educating customers.",
              "Interestingly, the social and psychological barrier\u2014a reluctance to change deeply rooted habits and a desire to fit in and conform to social norms\u2014poses a serious challenge across multiple categories.",
              "(See Exhibit 4.)",
              "Differences by geography further complicate the calculus.",
              "In the beverage industry, as noted above, awareness is a big issue across markets.",
              "But many important differences exist between developing markets (where, for example, availability is a top-two barrier) and developed markets, (where the social psychological barrier is a top-two problem).",
              "Meanwhile, companies must also wrestle with country-specific nuances.",
              "For example, 28% of customers in China and 31% in India think that sustainable drinks are not convenient enough for them to try;",
              "to overcome this barrier, companies may need to introduce innovative packaging or reassess formats and distribution.",
              "(See Exhibit 5.)",
              "Digging even deeper into the data for beverages, we found a pervasive social and psychological barrier across countries and industries.",
              "Globally, 45% of customers said that this barrier was holding them back from sustainable choices.",
              "Clearly, old habits die hard.",
              "The kind of beer people drink while watching sporting events and the kind of coffee they drink each morning become deeply entrenched and difficult to change even when they want to do so.",
              "Almost half of French, German, and Japanese customers admit to a psychological block\u2014to being \u201ctoo used to their regular drinks\u201d to move to more sustainable ones.",
              "(See Exhibit 6.)",
              "The desire for social conformity is, not surprisingly, another important driver of behavior.",
              "For example, 26% of Indian customers said that a major reason for not trying sustainable drinks is that their \u201cspouse, children or family do not like sustainable drinks.",
              "\u201d Although overcoming engrained habits is hard and social conformity works to preserve old patterns of conduct, we have defined a four-part framework that companies can use to nudge customer behavior toward sustainable choices and attract mainstream adoption of green options.",
              "The key is to communicate how sustainable choices can meet customers\u2019 core needs and drivers of choice (such as quality, convenience, value, taste, and health): Companies should pursue behavior change experimentation as rigorously as they do new product development.",
              "For example, to test whether customers could be prompted to make more sustainable choices, B4Development, the behavioral science team of the organizing committee for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, applied the four-part framework: when a customer called a restaurant to place a take-out order, the operator asked, \u201cDo you need plastic cutlery with your order?",
              "\u201d Here\u2019s how the framework played out: The result in this case\u2014an astonishing 59% reduction in demand for plastic cutlery\u2014was a total win-win.",
              "The reduced use of plastic helps the environment, and the restaurant saves costs.",
              "In many cases, using reusable cutlery (for example, metal knives for cutting) is better for consumers as well;",
              "and ideally, restaurant cost savings will be passed on to consumers.",
              "A similar nudge experiment by Nudge Lebanon, a nonprofit initiative working to apply behavioral insights to policy challenges, saw demand for plastic cutlery decline even more (by 77.",
              "9%), prompting Richard Thaler, the 2017 Nobel prize winner for economics and coauthor of the book Nudge, to tweet: \u201cgreat example of a low hanging fruit.",
              "\u201d In another case, a global supermarket in the Middle East launched an experiment with Nudge Lebanon to increase the use of reusable bags.",
              "It used a text message to remind customers to bring their eco-bags to the store, asserting that \u201ctogether we can save the planet.",
              "\u201d Here\u2019s how the framework played out: The result was a 6-percentage-point increase in the likelihood that regular customers would bring reusable bags to the store, lowering the plastic burden on the environment and enabling the supermarket to save the cost of single-use plastic bags and to generate revenue by selling eco-bags.",
              "To move the needle beyond 6 percentage points, the company could tailor the sustainability nudge to customers, focusing on cost savings (since many governments now tax single-use plastic bags) and on the advantages of stronger, more durable eco-friendly bags.",
              "We still have a lot of work to do to close the say-do gap and reach our collective climate ambitions.",
              "Real change cannot happen until green goes mainstream.",
              "For this to happen, companies must develop a deep understanding of customers\u2019 needs and motivations, and then adopt strategies to change customers\u2019 buying patterns.",
              "It\u2019s critical to understand that encouraging more sustainable choices doesn\u2019t require a grand marketing campaign or an enormous budget.",
              "In some instances, innovation and big changes may be necessary, but in other cases more subtle nudges can be just as effective: a well-timed text message or well-phrased question may suffice.",
