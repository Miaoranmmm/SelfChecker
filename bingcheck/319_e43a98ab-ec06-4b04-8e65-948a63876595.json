    "response": "Japanese origami is a traditional art of folding paper to create both two-dimensional and three-dimensional subjects. The word origami comes from Japanese oru (\u201cto fold\u201d) and kami (\u201cpaper\u201d)[^1^]. Origami originated in Japan in the sixth century, though it was used for religious ceremonies and special occasions for a long time[^3^] [^4^]. By the 17th century, origami had entered Japanese society and was being used for both decorative and ceremonial purposes, such as to mark religious sites or to give as tokens and gifts[^2^] [^4^]. Origami has evolved over time to become a globally recognized form of artistic expression, with many styles and techniques. Some of the styles include realistic, abstract, modular, composite, action, wet-folding, tessellation, and kirigami[^1^]. Origami techniques involve various types of folds, such as valley fold, mountain fold, reverse fold, squash fold, petal fold, rabbit ear fold, crimp fold, sink fold, and swivel fold[^1^]. Origami has also influenced other fields of art and science, such as mathematics, engineering, architecture, design, education, and medicine[^1^] [^5^].",

              "Writing a comprehensive history of paper folding is almost impossible, since information about the art form prior to the 15th century is virtually nonexistent.",
              "There are many plausible assertions about its origins and early history, but most of those are based on little firm documentation.",
              "Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China.",
              "It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials before paper was invented, so the origins of recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather.",
              "Certainly, within Europe, the practise of napkin folding and cloth pleating were held in high esteem.",
              "However, paper has proved to be the ideal material to fold, and so it is logical to assume that paper folding followed the discovery of the papermaking process.",
              "Paper was invented in China, and a Chinese court official, Cai Lun, has been traditionally credited as the inventor, though contemporary research suggests that paper was invented earlier.",
              "However, Cai is known to have introduced the concept of sheets of paper about the year 105 ce.",
              "By making paper from the macerated bark of trees, hemp waste, old rags, and fishnets, he discovered a far superior and cheaper way of creating a writing surface, compared with the cloth made of silk that was commonly used.",
              "Papermaking skills subsequently migrated to Korea and from there to Japan, via Buddhist monks, by 610.",
              "Japanese papermakers improved the quality of paper still further, and the quality of their paper would have been suitable for folding, although no hard evidence of origami exists before 1600.",
              "In 1680 a short poem by poet and novelist Ihara Saikaku references butterfly origami, revealing how well engrained in Japanese culture paper folding had become by that time.",
              "One of the earliest known paper-folding instruction books was Akisato Rito\u2019s Sembazuru orikata (1797), and it showed how to fold linked cranes cut and folded from a square of paper.",
              "German educator Friedrich Froebel (1782\u20131852), inventor of the kindergarten, was an avid proponent of paper folding and its educational benefits, and he helped to spread paper folding around the world.",
              "Three basic types of folds are associated with him: the Folds of Life (basic folds that introduced kids to paper folding), the Folds of Truth (teaching basic principles of geometry), and the Folds of Beauty (more-advanced folds based on squares, hexagons, and octagons);",
              "the famed folded and woven paper Froebel star, a popular Christmas craft and decoration, was named after him but was likely invented by someone else.",
              "About 1880 those Froebelian folds were introduced into Japan and Japanese schools, and it was about that time that the word origami began to be used to describe recreational folding.",
              "German contributions to paper folding continued with Rudolf Steiner\u2019s first Waldorf school (1919), in Stuttgart, Germany, which emphasized assorted hands-on activities including origami, and with the Bauhaus school of design (1919\u201333).",
              "Bauhaus used paper folding as a means of training students in commercial design, and revered Bauhaus teacher and artist Josef Albers was especially adept at creating dome-shaped structures from flat sheets of paper.",
              "Spanish author and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno (1864\u20131936) was also significant in spreading origami\u2019s popularity.",
              "He was a celebrated paper folder who could be found in cafe\u0301s making paper birds.",
              "He discussed paper folding in numerous works, including Amor y pedagogi\u0301a (1902;",
              "\u201cLove and Pedagogy\u201d), and even used it as a metaphor for his deeper discussions of science, religion, philosophy, and life.",
              "Paper folding spread across South America as well, principally because of the work of the Argentine physician and master folder Vicente Solo\u0301rzano Sagredo (1883\u20131970), author of the most comprehensive manuals on paper folding in Spanish.",
              "In England Margaret Campbell\u2019s seminal book Paper Toy Making was published in 1937, and it contained a large collection of origami designs.",
              "Two years later the paper flexagons of British mathematician A.",
              "H.",
              "Stone, whose paper structures altered their faces in curious ways when properly flexed, gave a boost to both the recreational and educational popularity of paper folding.",
              "After World War II there was increasing interest in origami in North America, and the subject was intensively researched, especially by folklorist Gershon Legman in the United States.",
              "In 1955 Legman arranged an exhibition in Amsterdam of the origami of the Japanese master Akira Yoshizawa (1911\u20132005).",
              "Yoshizawa was considered the preeminent folder of his time, and his work inspired subsequent generations of folders.",

              "Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China.",
              "It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials before paper was invented, so the origins of recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather.",

              "However, paper has proved to be the ideal material to fold, and so it is logical to assume that paper folding followed the discovery of the papermaking process.",

              "By making paper from the macerated bark of trees, hemp waste, old rags, and fishnets, he discovered a far superior and cheaper way of creating a writing surface, compared with the cloth made of silk that was commonly used.",

              "[5] By the 7th century, paper had been introduced to Japan from China via the Korean Peninsula, and the Japanese developed washi by improving the method of making paper in the Heian period.",
              "The paper making technique developed in Japan around 805 to 809 was called nagashi-suki (\u6d41\u3057\u6f09\u304d), a method of adding mucilage to the process of the conventional tame-suki (\u6e9c\u3081\u6f09\u304d) technique to form a stronger layer of paper fibers.",

              "It was a German who perhaps had the biggest influence on the development of the modern origami when Friedrich Fro\u0308bel, the creator of the Kindergarten, included paper folding as one of his \"gifts\" to children in his early years curriculum.",
              "Paper folding was seen as a way children could discover for themselves the basics of geometry, and they were taught the traditional folded designs including the salt-cellar, windmill, sailing boat, the bird (possibly the Spanish pajarita), and the double boat - simple folds all well-known today.",

              "Female teachers who studied the Fro\u0308bel method took paper folding all over the world.",
              "This was even adopted in Japan, where following the Meiji restoration of 1868 the country was looking to modernise along Western lines and adopted the Kindergarten model as their own for early years education.",

              "Born in 1911, Yoshizawa was perhaps the first true origami model making genius.",
              "He learnt origami as a child before rekindling his interest in folding when he used it to understand and communicate geometrical problems in his job as a technical draftsman.",
              "(17) In 1954 he published 'Atarashi Origami Geijutsu' (New Origami Art).",
              "This revolutionary work introduced a system of notation for origami diagrams (which is largely what is used today) as well as gifting to the world a huge number of new and highly realistic models of animals, insects, fish and birds.",
              "He devised ways to create multiple points through folding alone which removed the necessity of making cuts and opened up enormous possibilities as to what could be achieved through folding a single square of paper.",
              "Yoshizawa also invented a brand-new origami technique called 'wet-folding'.",
              "This involved dampening thick washi paper first and molding the paper into soft folds to create rounded and incredibly lifelike models which are more akin to paper sculptures than traditional origami models.",

              "It is more difficult than the closed unsink below because there is no internal flap to grab onto to help unsink the paper, so the paper must be opened out and the area to be unsunk is pushed out (to be convex) from inside the model and from behind.",

              "Advertisement Handbook of the Mathematics of the Arts and Sciences pp 1\u201332Cite as 615 Accesses Origami is usually connected with fun and games, and the most common association with origami is a paper-folded crane, which has a special place in Japanese culture.",
              "The popularity of modern origami has grown in many aspects, including mathematical, scientific, artistic, or even as an enjoyable craft.",
              "This chapter describes the developmental path of origami from simple paper folding through to that of a serious scientific discipline.",
              "It might be said that it all started with the discovery of mathematical rules behind the folds, which led to the axiomatization of origami and the establishment of it as a mathematical discipline.",
              "Many unsolved problems, such as doubling the cube, became solvable thanks to origami.",
              "Interestingly, while developing as a scientific discipline, origami has also been establishing itself as a form of modern art and is a great inspiration to many contemporary artists in different creative disciplines, such as sculpture, fashion, or design.",
              "Examples of these contemporary art forms are shown in this chapter.",
