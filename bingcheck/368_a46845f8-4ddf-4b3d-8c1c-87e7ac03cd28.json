    "query": "What is the most revolutionary and promising innovation in medical technology, and how is it changing the landscape of healthcare and patient outcomes?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and broad question. There are many innovations in medical technology that are revolutionary and promising, and it's hard to pick just one. However, based on the web search results, some of the most frequently mentioned ones are:\n\n- **Next generation of mRNA vaccinology**[^1^]: This technology uses messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct cells to produce proteins that can elicit immunity against various diseases, such as COVID-19, cancer and Zika virus. It is cost-effective, relatively simple to manufacture, and has shown remarkable efficacy and safety in clinical trials.\n- **PSMA-targeted therapy in prostate cancer**[^1^]: This therapy uses a radioactive tracer that binds to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a protein that is highly expressed on prostate cancer cells. The tracer can be combined with PET scans to visualize the location and extent of the tumor, and also deliver targeted radiation therapy to kill the cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues.\n- **Mapping the brain**[^2^]: This is an ambitious effort to understand the structure and function of the human brain at various levels, from molecules to circuits to behavior. It involves developing new imaging techniques, computational tools, and experimental methods to reveal how the brain works in health and disease. It could lead to new treatments for neurological disorders such as autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.\n- **Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare**[^3^]: AI is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines or systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, decision making, and natural language processing. AI has many applications in healthcare, such as diagnosing diseases, analyzing medical images, discovering new drugs, personalizing treatments, and improving patient outcomes.\n- **Synthetic biology**[^5^]: Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field that combines engineering principles with biology to design and create new biological systems or modify existing ones. Synthetic biology has many potential benefits for healthcare, such as producing novel therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics, biosensors, and biofuels.\n\nThese are just some examples of the medical innovations that are changing the landscape of healthcare and patient outcomes. There are many more that could be mentioned, and I'm sure there will be more discoveries and breakthroughs in the future.",

              "By all accounts, the pandemic response was remarkable.",
              "Hundreds of vaccine candidates based on a wide range of traditional and novel technologies were investigated at exceptional speed, and one of the novel technologies\u2014mRNA vaccines\u2014became established as a key tool to combat COVID-19.",
              "But the approved mRNA vaccines are not without limitations.",
              "Last year, the vaccine development foundation Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) launched a call for proposals seeking innovative RNA platforms that could offer improvements over existing mRNA vaccine technology.",
              "\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for are high-impact innovations that potentially could be used for next-generation RNA platforms\u2014things that would maybe improve on some of the characteristics of the current RNA vaccines, which obviously made huge strides,\u201d said In-Kyu Yoon, CEPI\u2019s director and global head of programs and innovative technology.",
              "Yoon pointed to a range of characteristics with room for improvement, such as the balance between immunogenicity and reactogenicity, the thermostability profile, and cost.",
              "Then, in April 2023, the Biden administration announced Project Next Gen, the $5 billion successor to Operation Warp Speed, charged with coaxing development of COVID-19 vaccines that would improve on today\u2019s approved vaccine in three areas: durability, effectiveness against new variants, and ability to block transmission.",
              "It\u2019s a clear sign that public health bodies recognize that available vaccines are not optimal, said Ji Li, who is co-founder, president and CEO of vaccine developer Uvax Bio.",
              "A month later, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved GSK\u2019s Arexvy, the first respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine.",
              "The RSV vaccine relies on advances in structural biology, and adjuvants that took more than three decades to develop, said Philippe Denoe\u0308l, head of external research and development GSK Vaccines.",
              "The various technologies deployed for recently approved vaccines highlight the value of pursuing novel approaches.",
              "The relative success of mRNA-based vaccines has energized groups seeking to improve on the technology.",
              "One commonly overlooked distinction between mRNA and more traditional technologies is that mRNA itself is not actually a vaccine\u2014it effectively turns human cells into vaccine factories by inducing them to produce viral antigens.",
              "That means it has to be delivered into cells, which to date has been through lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), artificial shells that house the fragile mRNA molecules and transport them across cell membranes.",
              "LNPs, however, are imperfect taxis.",
              "For one, they are suspected to play a role in vaccine reactogenicity, resulting in inflammatory responses that lead to both local side effects like pain or swelling, and systemic side effects including fever.",
              "As such, several groups are developing alternative vehicles that can carry mRNA without the side effects.",
              "In January 2023, CEPI announced the first grant from its calls for proposals, choosing Tiba Biotech\u2019s polymer nanoparticle technology.",
              "Beyond reduced reactogenicity, Yoon cited several potential advantages of polymer nanoparticles over LNPs, including increased RNA payload capacity and even thermostability\u2014\u201cultra-cold storage is a feature of the currently licensed mRNA vaccines.",
              "\u201d The $2 million CEPI grant will support preclinical research for Tiba\u2019s polymer nanotechnology.",
              "Meanwhile, Moderna announced a partnership in April 2023 with IBM that aims to utilize artificial intelligence and quantum computing to optimize LNPs for both safety and performance.",
              "Denoe\u0308l also noted that there are opportunities to improve activity once mRNA has reached a cell, using bioinformatics tools.",
              "\u201cThere are new technologies that allow us to really optimize your mRNA sequence\u2014for higher expression levels, and to lower any undesired natural response of the host cell, such as interferon responses,\u201d he said.",
              "In addition, synthetic biology companies are developing DNA templates that could make the production of mRNA even faster in response to emerging pathogens.",
              "Another approach to improving intracellular activity is self-amplifying RNA, where a vaccine encodes not only a viral antigen but also the RNA itself.",
              "The result is more antigens produced over a longer period, with less vaccine required.",
              "A self-replicating mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 from Gennova Biopharmaceuticals has been approved under emergency use authorization in India.",
              "And Yoon notes there are groups developing circular RNA, with similarly long-lasting transcription within the cell.",
              "Beyond mRNA, several novel technologies are seeking to expand what\u2019s worked for approved vaccines, often harnessing naturally occurring elements to trigger immune responses.",
              "One new approach that does both is a self-assembling protein nanoparticle platform developed by researchers at the Scripps Research Institute.",
              "In April 2023, researchers led by senior author Jiang Zhu, associate professor in the Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology at Scripps, published positive preclinical data in Nature Communications (Nat.",
              "Comms. 14, 1985;",
              "2023) for a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine candidate based on the platform.",
              "Zhu\u2014who spun out the technology to form Uvax Bio\u2014was inspired by the virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine that produced a highly successful human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.",
              "\u201cOur intention is to mimic the most successful vaccine on the market,\u201d said Zhu.",
              "He added that protein-based vaccines are known for producing a more robust neutralizing antibody response than nucleic acid-based vaccines.",
              "The goal, he said, is \u201cone shot, protection for life.",
              "\u201d HPV vaccines resemble hollowed-out papillomaviruses, sharing a self-assembling protein-based outer capsid but having no genetic information inside.",
              "And they are highly immunogenic;",
              "98% of recipients develop antibody responses.",
              "But the approach has not been broadly repeatable because, unlike papillomaviruses, many pathogenic viruses are protected by an outer lipid envelope.",
              "Zhu developed protein nanoparticles that resembled the HPV shell and that could display multiple copies of HIV\u2019s envelope glycoprotein, inducing a strong immune response in preclinical testing.",
              "Because optimized antigens can easily be swapped into the VLP, Uvax Bio has an early pipeline including the HIV program and 11 other enveloped viruses, as well as one for tuberculosis.",

              "However, their application has until recently been restricted by the instability and inefficient in vivo delivery of mRNA.",
              "Recent technological advances have now largely overcome these issues, and multiple mRNA vaccine platforms against infectious diseases and several types of cancer have demonstrated encouraging results in both animal models and humans.",
              "This Review provides a detailed overview of mRNA vaccines and considers future directions and challenges in advancing this promising vaccine platform to widespread therapeutic use.",
              "Vaccines prevent many millions of illnesses and save numerous lives every year1.",
              "As a result of widespread vaccine use, the smallpox virus has been completely eradicated and the incidence of polio, measles and other childhood diseases has been drastically reduced around the world2.",
              "Conventional vaccine approaches, such as live attenuated and inactivated pathogens and subunit vaccines, provide durable protection against a variety of dangerous diseases3.",
              "Despite this success, there remain major hurdles to vaccine development against a variety of infectious pathogens, especially those better able to evade the adaptive immune response4.",
              "Moreover, for most emerging virus vaccines, the main obstacle is not the effectiveness of conventional approaches but the need for more rapid development and large-scale deployment.",
              "Finally, conventional vaccine approaches may not be applicable to non-infectious diseases, such as cancer.",
              "The development of more potent and versatile vaccine platforms is therefore urgently needed.",
              "Nucleic acid therapeutics have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional vaccine approaches.",
              "The first report of the successful use of in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA in animals was published in 1990, when reporter gene mRNAs were injected into mice and protein production was detected5.",
              "A subsequent study in 1992 demonstrated that administration of vasopressin-encoding mRNA in the hypothalamus could elicit a physiological response in rats6.",
              "However, these early promising results did not lead to substantial investment in developing mRNA therapeutics, largely owing to concerns associated with mRNA instability, high innate immunogenicity and inefficient in vivo delivery.",
              "Instead, the field pursued DNA-based and protein-based therapeutic approaches7,8.",
              "Over the past decade, major technological innovation and research investment have enabled mRNA to become a promising therapeutic tool in the fields of vaccine development and protein replacement therapy.",
              "The use of mRNA has several beneficial features over subunit, killed and live attenuated virus, as well as DNA-based vaccines.",
              "First, safety: as mRNA is a non-infectious, non-integrating platform, there is no potential risk of infection or insertional mutagenesis.",
              "Additionally, mRNA is degraded by normal cellular processes, and its in vivo half-life can be regulated through the use of various modifications and delivery methods9\u201312.",
              "The inherent immunogenicity of the mRNA can be down-modulated to further increase the safety profile9,12,13.",
              "Second, efficacy: various modifications make mRNA more stable and highly translatable9,12,13.",
              "Efficient in vivo delivery can be achieved by formulating mRNA into carrier molecules, allowing rapid uptake and expression in the cytoplasm (reviewed in REFS 10,11).",
              "mRNA is the minimal genetic vector;",
              "therefore, anti-vector immunity is avoided, and mRNA vaccines can be administered repeatedly.",
              "Third, production: mRNA vaccines have the potential for rapid, inexpensive and scalable manufacturing, mainly owing to the high yields of in vitro transcription reactions.",
              "The mRNA vaccine field is developing extremely rapidly;",
              "a large body of preclinical data has accumulated over the past several years, and multiple human clinical trials have been initiated.",
              "In this Review, we discuss current mRNA vaccine approaches, summarize the latest findings, highlight challenges and recent successes, and offer perspectives on the future of mRNA vaccines.",
              "The data suggest that mRNA vaccines have the potential to solve many of the challenges in vaccine development for both infectious diseases and cancer.",
              "mRNA is the intermediate step between the translation of protein-encoding DNA and the production of proteins by ribosomes in the cytoplasm.",
              "Two major types of RNA are currently studied as vaccines: non-replicating mRNA and virally derived, self-amplifying RNA.",
              "Conventional mRNA-based vaccines encode the antigen of interest and contain 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs), whereas self-amplifying RNAs encode not only the antigen but also the viral replication machinery that enables intracellular RNA amplification and abundant protein expression.",
              "The construction of optimally translated IVT mRNA suitable for therapeutic use has been reviewed previously14,15.",

              "Another key finding, Dr.",
              "Hofman noted, was that PSMA PET-CT was much less likely to produce inconclusive, or equivocal, results (7% versus 23%).",
              "That\u2019s important, he continued, \u201cbecause if you have a scan with equivocal findings, it often leads to more scans or biopsies or other tests.",

              "Specific indications include determining whether or not a patient has clinically significant prostate cancer in patients on active surveillance and to improve the yield of transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies for clinically significant disease in patients with prior negative biopsy or who have elevated serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels (21,22).",
              "To date, there is limited literature in regards to the role of PSMA PET in the active surveillance or secondary screening settings as previously reported studies have focused on patients with known prostate cancer who are being preoperatively staged prior to undergoing prostatectomy.",
              "Nonetheless, PSMA PET may be beneficial as it is not expressed in benign prostatic hypertrophy and it may have additive value for primary prostate cancer detection when combined with multi-parametric MRI (23).",

              "In these patients, the characterization of the primary tumor is no longer relevant, and the central issue is detecting nodal metastases prior to treatment, especially as prostatectomies are being performed in increasingly higher risk patients (24,25).",
              "The largest study to date in this population is a retrospective evaluation of 131 patients imaged with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET who subsequently underwent prostatectomy (26);",

              "The major techniques to detect event-related potentials can be divided into two categories, time-locked averaging techniques and spectral analysis techniques.",
              "Time-locked averaging techniques are usually used to detect evoked activities, which are time-locked to the presentation of stimuli.",
              "Because most noise occurs randomly, time-locked averaging techniques can greatly reduce the noise while preserving the event-related signals in the EEG.",
              "Time-locked averaging can be either stimulus-locked or response-locked.",
              "In addition to time-locked responses, there may also be signals in the EEG that are related to stimulus processing without a well-defined temporal relation to the event.",
              "These responses are called induced activity.",
              "An example of induced activity is oscillatory activity (e.",
              "g. gamma oscillations), which might have a different phase in each single measurement and therefore would cancel one another in time-locked averaging.",
              "However, induced activity can be detected using spectral analysis, in which EEG recordings are decomposed into a number of frequency (sinusoidal) components, such as delta (0-3Hz), theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-12Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), gamma (30-50 Hz), and high gamma (80-150 Hz).",
              "Among the various spectral analysis techniques, Fourier transform (FT) is traditionally the preferred method because it is time-shift invariant in both the time and frequency domains.",
              "However, in FT, any time-varying spectral content of the signal is ignored because it assumes that the signal is stationary over time.",
              "This assumption is in contradiction to the fact that EEG signals are non-stationary.",

              "This method does not require any contrast agents.",
              "Compared to the BOLD responses (to be discussed below), the signal in perfusion fMRI is more stable and the noise is much whiter.",
              "However, the relatively weak signal and the length of image acquisition time have limited the use of perfusion fMRI in cognitive neuroscience.",
              "Currently, the most widely used fMRI method is BOLD imaging, which detects the difference in magnetic susceptibility between oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin.",
              "Hemoglobin is diamagnetic when oxygenated but paramagnetic when deoxygenated.",
              "The magnetic property of blood therefore depends on its oxygenation level.",
              "Although neuronal activities consume some oxygen, the increase in blood flow following neuronal activities supplies more oxygen than the neuronal consumption, resulting in an increase in oxygenated hemoglobin and therefore increased BOLD response.",
              "Although BOLD fMRI is an indirect measure of neuronal activities, there is strong empirical evidence that the BOLD signals are highly correlated with neuronal activities (Logothetis et al.",
              ", 2001).",
              "Because the BOLD signals are usually stronger and require less time to acquire than perfusion signals, BOLD fMRI is more popular than perfusion fMRI.",
              "One major technical challenge for fMRI is that the hemodynamic responses are relatively slow, weak, and noisy.",
              "The typical BOLD hemodynamic response following a single stimulus event starts to rise after 1 to 2 seconds, peaks at 4-6 seconds, and returns to its baseline after 12-16 seconds.",
              "The typical BOLD signal change following a single stimulus event captured on a 3T scanner is about 1-2% and varies greatly across different event types and different brain regions.",
              "To increase the statistical power of fMRI studies, many repetitions of the same event type are necessary.",
              "In the early years of fMRI research, block design, in which the same types of stimuli are grouped together in each block, was used in many studies.",
              "A block design can generate strong BOLD signals that are relatively easy to process.",
              "However, block design has several limitations.",
              "First, in some experimental paradigms, the events cannot be blocked.",
              "For example, in an oddball paradigm, the target trials are presented amongst more common stimuli.",
              "Such target trials cannot be blocked.",
              "Second, in some experiments, the nature of each particular trial cannot be predetermined to allow for a block design.",
              "For example, in memory research, trials remembered vs. forgotten cannot be discovered prior to the recall/recognition test.",
              "Similarly, trials won vs. lost in a gambling task cannot be known prior to subject's response.",
              "It is therefore impossible to use a block design to examine the neural bases of winning vs. losing bets or remembering vs. forgetting.",
              "To overcome these limitations, event-related design was introduced.",
              "The early event-related design studies usually used long inter-trial intervals (12 to 20 s) to avoid the overlap of the BOLD responses between trials.",
              "Slow event-related designs turned out to be very boring for subjects and were highly inefficient in data collection.",

              "If they match, we can then conclude with some confidence that observing an out-group member would engage negative emotions (see Miller, 2008 for similar discussion).",
              "Third, the laboratory settings for functional imaging studies are very different from daily life.",
              "To simplify interpretations of experimental results, researchers have usually used oversimplified decision tasks and added strict experimental controls.",
              "These practices might have impaired the ecological validity of these tasks and limited their explanatory power in accounting for real-life decision-making phenomena.",
              "For example, in typical fMRI studies, participants have to stay very still in a semi-closed space for a relatively long time, and engage in very limited social interactions.",
              "Due to the weak signal levels in brain imaging, most studies require repetitions of the same decision.",
              "As a result, the decision- making tasks in this setting have to be relatively simple and can be made quickly.",
              "These requirements have placed major limitations on the research questions that can be addressed with functional imaging techniques.",
              "In addition, to dissociate the neural responses involved in different cognitive processes, special task designs are required in many functional imaging studies.",
              "For example, since the BOLD response is very slow, in order to separate the neural responses associated with decision and feedback processes, researchers have to either discard the feedback or introduce long and jittered delays between decision and feedback.",
              "Although these manipulations have been very successful, their effects on the psychological and neural processes of decision-making are not well understood and it is not clear how results from these studies can be connected to daily life decision-making, such as gambling in Las Vegas.",
              "One possible way to increase the ecological validity of functional imaging studies is to associate laboratory task performance with performance in daily-life decision-making.",
              "For example, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), developed by Bechara and colleagues (1994) to examine risky decision-making in laboratory settings, has been shown to be able to predict decision-making behavior in daily life situations.",
              "Our hope is that, with technical advances, a lot of these issues can be resolved in the near future.",
              "Finally, the fundamental question is whether we can make better predictions of human decision behavior from neuroeconomical studies.",
              "Since the birth of neuroeconomics, researchers have been debating whether neuroimaging can provide theories for economists or whether economic theories can provide frameworks for neuroscience (Glimcher, Camerer, Poldrack, & Fehr, 2008).",
              "Ultimately, critics are skeptical whether neuroimaging can provide better descriptions and predictions of human decision-making behaviors than behavioral theories.",
              "In a 2005 article by two economists at Princeton University, Faruk Gul and Wolfgang Pesendorfer, \u201cThe Case for Mindless Economics\u201d, the authors argued that neuroscience cannot transform economics because what goes on inside the brain is irrelevant to the discipline.",
              "What matters are the decisions people make--in their jargon, the \u201crevealed preferences\u201d--not the process by which they reach them (Gul & Pesendorfer, 2005).",
              "The argument is similar to that of \u201cmindless\u201d psychology used by behaviorists and that of \u201cbrainless\u201d psychology used by cognitive psychologists.",
              "Although it would be easier to argue for \u201cmindless\u201d decision making than \u201cbrainless\u201d decision making, since the latter is based on traceable physical responses, many enthusiasts of neuroeconomics like Daniel Kahneman have acknowledged that the findings in neuroeconomics have so far generally just confirmed the expectations of behavioral theorists and behavioral economists (Kahneman, 2008).",
              "This is a methodological issue as well as a theoretical issue, and it is not limited to functional imaging techniques but also applies to other methods in neuroeconomics.",
              "So far we are nowhere close to a solution to this issue, but we have reasons to be optimistic since neuroeconomics is in its infancy and its potential in describing the neural bases of decision-making and predicting future decision making has just begun to be revealed.",
              "This paper provides an overview of brain imaging techniques, with an emphasis on functional MRI and EEG, and their applications in studying human decision-making.",
              "With its rapid development and wide applications, brain imaging has profoundly changed the landscape of cognitive neuroscience research.",
              "One prominent application of brain imaging in the last few years is neuroeconomics, an emerging field that has roots in economics, neuroscience, and psychology.",
              "By combining theoretical models from experimental and behavioral economics and real-time measurements of brain activities, neuroeconomics has significantly advanced our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying a wide range of decision behaviors, such as decision under uncertainty, intertemporal choice, and game theory.",
              "We believe neuroeconomics will fully realize its potentials by addressing several theoretical and methodological challenges.",
