    "query": "What is the most effective strategy for developing and implementing renewable energy solutions in developing countries with limited resources, and what impact could this have on promoting sustainable development and reducing global carbon emissions?",
    "response": "That is a very complex and important question. There is no single answer, but I can try to give you some information based on web searches.\n\nAccording to the World Bank[^1^], developing countries are leading the way on renewable energy by attracting private investment to well-crafted, larger-scale projects. Some examples are Morocco, which has renewable energy projects that make up two-fifths of its installed energy capacity, and India, which has the fastest-growing rate of renewable electricity growth of any major economy[^1^].\n\nHowever, developing countries may face challenges such as lack of access to finance under reasonable terms, weak regulatory frameworks, high upfront costs, and technical barriers[^1^] [^2^]. Therefore, they may need support from international organizations, governments, and civil society to overcome these obstacles and scale up renewable energy deployment[^2^] [^3^].\n\nOne of the main benefits of renewable energy is that it can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector, which is the largest source of global emissions[^4^]. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar do not emit carbon dioxide when generating electricity, unlike fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas[^7^].\n\nAccording to a report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in developing countries could reduce 0.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) from annual emissions by 2020[^4^]. This is equivalent to about 1.5% of global emissions in 2019[^4^]. However, this potential is not fully realized due to various barriers and gaps in implementation[^4^].\n\nThe UNEP report also states that renewable energy and energy efficiency can contribute to sustainable development by improving access to clean and affordable energy, creating jobs and income opportunities, enhancing health and well-being, reducing air pollution and environmental degradation, and strengthening resilience to climate change impacts[^4^].\n\nTherefore, renewable energy solutions in developing countries can have a positive impact on both mitigating climate change and promoting sustainable development. However, they require concerted efforts from multiple stakeholders to overcome the challenges and unlock the opportunities that they offer. I hope this information was helpful. \ud83d\ude0a",

              "World Energy Outlook Special Report This report is part of World Energy Outlook 2021 Read online Read online Read online Read online India has seen extraordinary successes in its recent energy development, but many challenges remain, and the Covid-19 pandemic has been a major disruption.",
              "In recent years, India has brought electricity connections to hundreds of millions of its citizens;",
              "promoted the adoption of highly-efficient LED lighting by most households;",
              "and prompted a massive expansion in renewable sources of energy, led by solar power.",
              "The gains for Indian citizens and their quality of life have been tangible.",
              "However, the Covid-19 crisis has complicated efforts to resolve other pressing problems. These include a lack of reliable electricity supply for many consumers;",
              "a continued reliance on solid biomass, mainly firewood, as a cooking fuel for some 660 million people;",
              "financially ailing electricity distribution companies, and air quality that has made Indian cities among the most polluted in the world.",
              "India is the world\u2019s third-largest energy consuming country, thanks to rising incomes and improving standards of living.",
              "Energy use has doubled since 2000, with 80% of demand still being met by coal, oil and solid biomass.",
              "On a per capita basis, India\u2019s energy use and emissions are less than half the world average, as are other key indicators such as vehicle ownership, steel and cement output.",
              "As India recovers from a Covid-induced slump in 2020, it is re-entering a very dynamic period in its energy development.",
              "Over the coming years, millions of Indian households are set to buy new appliances, air conditioning units and vehicles.",
              "India will soon become the world\u2019s most populous country, adding the equivalent of a city the size of Los Angeles to its urban population each year.",
              "To meet growth in electricity demand over the next twenty years, India will need to add a power system the size of the European Union to what it has now.",
              "This special report maps out possible energy futures for India, the levers and decisions that bring them about, and the interactions that arise across a complex energy system.",
              "The increasing urgency driving the global response to climate change is a pivotal theme.",
              "India has so far contributed relatively little to the world\u2019s cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, but the country is already feeling their effects.",
              "This report\u2019s analysis is based on a detailed review of existing or announced energy reforms and targets.",
              "These include the aims of quadrupling renewable electricity capacity by 2030, more than doubling the share of natural gas in the energy mix, enhancing energy efficiency and transport infrastructure, increasing domestic coal output, and reducing reliance on imports.",
              "Progress towards these policy goals varies across our report\u2019s different scenarios, none of which is a forecast.",
              "Our aim is rather to provide a coherent framework in which to consider India\u2019s choices and their implications.",
              "Prior to the global pandemic, India\u2019s energy demand was projected to increase by almost 50% between 2019 and 2030, but growth over this period is now closer to 35% in the STEPS, and 25% in the Delayed Recovery Scenario.",
              "The latter would put some of India\u2019s hard-won gains in the fight against energy poverty at risk, as lower-income households are forced to fall back on more polluting and inefficient sources of energy.",
              "It would also extend the slump in energy investment, which we estimate to have fallen by some 15% in India in 2020.",
              "Even though the pandemic and its aftermath could temporarily suppress emissions, as coal and oil bear the brunt of the reduction in demand, it does not move India any closer to its long-term sustainable development goals.",
              "An expanding economy, population, urbanisation and industrialisation mean that India sees the largest increase in energy demand of any country, across all of our scenarios to 2040.",
              "India\u2019s economic growth has historically been driven mainly by the services sector rather than the more energy-intensive industrial sector, and the rate at which India has urbanised has also been slower than in other comparable countries.",
              "But even at a relatively modest assumed urbanisation rate, India\u2019s sheer size means that 270 million people are still set to be added to India\u2019s urban population over the next two decades.",
              "This leads to rapid growth in the building stock and other infrastructure.",
              "The resulting surge in demand for a range of construction materials, notably steel and cement, highlights the pivot in global manufacturing towards India.",
              "In the STEPS, as India develops and modernises, its rate of energy demand growth is three times the global average.",
              "Solar power is set for explosive growth in India, matching coal\u2019s share in the Indian power generation mix within two decades in the STEPS \u2013 or even sooner in the Sustainable Development Scenario.",
              "As things stand, solar accounts for less than 4% of India\u2019s electricity generation, and coal close to 70%.",
              "By 2040, they converge in the low 30%s in the STEPS, and this switch is even more rapid in other scenarios.",
              "This dramatic turnaround is driven by India\u2019s policy ambitions, notably the target to reach 450 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, and the extraordinary cost-competitiveness of solar, which out-competes existing coal-fired power by 2030 even when paired with battery storage.",
              "The rise of utility-scale renewable projects is underpinned by some innovative regulatory approaches that encourage pairing solar with other generation technologies, and with storage, to offer \u201cround the clock\u201d supply.",
              "Keeping up momentum behind investments in renewables also means tackling risks relating to delayed payments to generators, land acquisition, and regulatory and contract uncertainty.",
              "However, the projections in the STEPS do not come close to exhausting the scope for solar to meet India\u2019s energy needs, especially for other applications such as rooftop solar, solar thermal heating, and water pumps.",
              "India\u2019s electricity demand is set to increase much more rapidly than its overall energy demand.",
              "But a defining feature of the outlook is a sharp rise in variability \u2013 both in electricity output, from solar PV and wind, and in daily consumption.",
              "On the supply side, output from renewables in some Indian states is set to exceed demand on a regular basis (typically around the middle of the day) before 2030.",
              "On the demand side, the key contributor to variability comes from rapid growth in ownership of air-conditioning units.",
              "Energy efficiency measures targeting both cooling appliances and buildings avoid around a quarter of the potential growth in consumption in the STEPS, but electricity demand for cooling still increases six-fold by 2040, creating a major early evening peak in electricity use.",
              "The pace of change in the electricity sector puts a huge premium on robust grids and other sources of flexibility, with India becoming a global leader in battery storage.",
              "India has a higher requirement for flexibility in its power system operation than almost any other country in the world.",
              "In the near term, India\u2019s large grid and its coal-fired power fleet meet the bulk of India\u2019s flexibility needs, supported by hydropower and gas-fired capacity.",
              "Going forward, new power lines and demand-side options \u2013 such as improving the efficiency of air conditioners or shifting the operation of agricultural pumps to different parts of the day \u2013 will need to play a much greater role.",
              "But battery storage is particularly well suited to the short-run flexibility that India needs to align its solar-led generation peak in the middle of the day with the country\u2019s early evening peak in demand.",
              "By 2040, India has 140 GW of battery capacity in the STEPS, the largest of any country, and close to 200 GW in the Sustainable Development Scenario.",
              "Coal\u2019s hold over India\u2019s power sector is loosening, with industry accounting for most of the increase in coal demand to 2040 in the STEPS.",
              "Once the coal-fired power plants currently under construction are completed over the next few years, there is no net growth at all in India\u2019s coal fleet.",
              "Coal-fired generation was most exposed to the dip in electricity consumption in 2020.",
              "It picks up slightly in the STEPS as demand recovers, since renewables do not cover all of the projected increase in electricity demand.",
              "However, coal suppliers looking for growth increasingly have to turn to India\u2019s industrial consumers rather than the power sector.",
              "The share of coal in the overall energy mix steadily declines in the STEPS, from 44% in 2019 to 34% in 2040, and more rapidly in other scenarios.",
              "Energy demand for road transport in the STEPS is projected to more than double over the next two decades, although this growth is cut dramatically in the Sustainable Development Scenario.",
              "Over half of the growth in the STEPS is fuelled by diesel-based freight transport.",
              "An extra 25 million trucks are travelling on India\u2019s roads by 2040 as road freight activity triples, and a total of 300 million vehicles of all types are added to India\u2019s fleet between now and then.",
              "Transport has been the fastest-growing end-use sector in recent years, and India is set for a huge expansion of transportation infrastructure \u2013 from highways, railways and metro lines to airports and ports.",
              "Today\u2019s policy settings are sufficient to prevent runaway growth in transport energy demand.",
              "And some parts of the system shift rapidly to less energy-intensive options, with one example being a strong increase in the use of two-or-three-wheeled vehicles for road transport.",
              "Nonetheless, in the STEPS, India\u2019s oil demand rises by almost 4 million barrels per day (mb/d) to reach 8.",
              "7 mb/d in 2040, the largest increase of any country.",
              "In the Sustainable Development Scenario, by contrast, a much stronger push for electrification, efficiency and fuel switching limits growth in oil demand to less than 1 mb/d.",
              "India is set to more than double its building space over the next two decades, with 70% of new construction happening in urban areas.",
              "The model of urbanisation that India follows and the extent to which new construction follows energy-efficient building codes will shape patterns of energy use far into the future.",
              "The shift towards urban living accelerates transitions in residential energy use away from solid biomass and towards electricity and modern fuels.",
              "Buoyed by rising appliance ownership and demand for cooling, the share of electricity in residential energy use nearly triples.",
              "Nonetheless, in the STEPS, firewood and other traditional fuels are still widely used for cooking by 2030.",
              "It would take an additional push \u2013 as in the India Vision Case and the Sustainable Development Scenario \u2013 to move all households to LPG, improved cook stoves, gas or electricity.",
              "In the STEPS, India exceeds the goals set out in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.",
              "The emissions intensity of India\u2019s economy improves by 40% from 2005 to 2030, above the 33-35% set out in its existing NDC.",
              "And the share of non-fossil fuels in electricity generation capacity reaches almost 60%, well above the 40% that India pledged.",
              "India\u2019s leadership in the deployment of clean energy technologies expands its market for solar PV, wind turbine and lithium-ion battery equipment to over $40 billion per year in the STEPS by 2040.",
              "As a result, 1 in every 7 dollars spent worldwide on these three types of equipment in 2040 is in India, compared with 1 in 20 today.",
              "India\u2019s clean energy workforce grows by 1 million over the next ten years.",
              "If the approach embodied in today\u2019s policies can be realised in full, as in the India Vision Case, higher economic growth than in the STEPS need not mean higher energy demand and emissions.",
              "In this Case, and especially in the Sustainable Development Scenario where the equipment market for solar, wind, batteries and water electrolysers rises to $80 billion per year, the industrial and commercial opportunities from clean energy are even larger.",
              "The market for natural gas is growing fast in India, but its role varies by sector, by scenario and over time.",
              "The 6% share of natural gas in India\u2019s current energy mix is among the lowest in the world.",
              "It almost doubles in the STEPS as gas use rises in the industrial sector and in city gas distribution.",
              "In the India Vision Case, natural gas also helps to displace coal in power generation, bringing India\u2019s aspiration of a \u201cgas-based economy\u201d closer still.",
              "However, affordability is a sensitive issue for consumers, especially given the complex patchwork of additional charges and tariffs that, on average, doubled the cost of wholesale gas by the time it reached end-users in 2019.",
              "As India builds out its gas infrastructure, natural gas can find multiple uses in India\u2019s energy system, including to help meet air quality and near-term emissions goals if supply chains are managed responsibly.",
              "But the Sustainable Development Scenario also underlines that a long-term vision for gas needs to incorporate a growing role for biogases and low-carbon hydrogen, for which India has large potential.",
              "India\u2019s combined import bill for fossil fuels triples over the next two decades in the STEPS, with oil by far the largest component, pointing to continued risks to India\u2019s energy security.",
              "Domestic production of oil and gas continues to fall behind consumption trends and net dependence on imported oil rises above 90% by 2040, up from 75% today.",
              "This continued reliance on imported fuels creates vulnerabilities to price cycles and volatility as well as possible disruptions to supply.",
              "Energy security hazards could arise in India\u2019s domestic market as well, notably in the electricity sector if the necessary flexibility in power system operation does not materialise.",
              "An additional systemic threat to the reliability of electricity supply comes from the poor financial health of many electricity distribution companies.",
              "Improving the cost-reflectiveness of tariffs, the efficiency of billing and collection and reducing technical and commercial losses are key to reforming this sector.",
              "A 50% rise in India\u2019s CO2 emissions to 2040 is the largest of any country in the STEPS, even though India\u2019s per capita CO2 emissions remain well below the global average.",
              "The increase in India\u2019s emissions is enough to offset entirely the projected fall in emissions in Europe over the same period.",
              "The remarkable rise of renewables arrests the growth in India\u2019s power sector emissions in the STEPS, although this still leaves the coal-fired fleet \u2013 the fifth-largest single category of emissions worldwide today \u2013 as a major emitter of CO2.",
              "Alongside the option of early retirement in some cases, this puts a strong premium on policy approaches that can retool this fleet for more limited and flexible operation and/or on technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS).",
              "But the main reasons for the increase in India\u2019s CO2 emissions in the STEPS lie outside the power sector, in industry and transport (especially from trucks).",
              "These two sectors are also responsible for a much larger share of air pollutant emissions than the power sector in the STEPS, and a rising urban population means that more people are exposed to air pollution and suffer its ill effects.",
              "Water stress is likewise an increasingly important factor for India\u2019s energy sector and its technology choices.",
              "As the world seeks ways to accelerate the pace of transformation in the energy sector, India is in a unique position to pioneer a new model for low-carbon, inclusive growth.",
              "Many aspects of such a model are already evident in India\u2019s policy vision, and many more are highlighted in the Sustainable Development Scenario that points the way for India towards net-zero emissions.",
              "If this can be done, it will show the way for a whole group of energy-hungry developing economies, by demonstrating that robust economic expansion is fully compatible with an increasing pace of emissions reductions and the achievement of other development goals.",
              "India is already a global leader in solar power \u2013 and solar combined with batteries will play a massive part in India\u2019s energy future.",
              "But India will need a whole host of technologies and policies to chart this new path.",
              "As new industrial sectors emerge and clean energy jobs grow, India will also need to ensure that no one is left behind, including in those regions that are heavily dependent on coal today.",
              "More than that of any other major economy, India\u2019s energy future depends on buildings and factories yet to be built, and vehicles and appliances yet to be bought.",
              "Within 20 years, the majority of India\u2019s emissions in the STEPS come from power plants, industrial facilities, buildings and vehicles that do not exist today.",
              "This represents a huge opening for policies to steer India onto a more secure and sustainable course.",
              "India\u2019s ambitious renewables targets are already acting as a catalyst for the transformation of its power sector.",
              "A crucial \u2013 and even more challenging \u2013 task ahead is to put the industrial sector on a similarly new path through more widespread electrification, material and energy efficiency, technologies such as CCUS, and a switch to progressively lower-carbon fuels.",
              "Electrification, efficiency and fuel switching are also the main tools for the transport sector, alongside a determined move to build more sustainable transport infrastructure and shift more freight onto India\u2019s soon-to-be-electrified railways.",
              "These transformations require innovation, partnerships and capital.",
              "The additional capital required for clean energy technologies to 2040 in the Sustainable Development Scenario is $1.",
              "4 trillion above the level in the STEPS.",
              "But the benefits are huge, including savings of the same magnitude on oil import bills.",
              "Government policies to accelerate India\u2019s clean energy transition can lay the foundation for lasting prosperity and greater energy security.",
              "The stakes could not be higher, for India and for the world.",

              "India\u2019s announcement that it aims to reach net zero emissions by 2070 and to meet fifty percent of its electricity requirements from renewable energy sources by 2030 is a hugely significant moment for the global fight against climate change.",
              "India is pioneering a new model of economic development that could avoid the carbon-intensive approaches that many countries have pursued in the past \u2013 and provide a blueprint for other developing economies.",
              "The scale of transformation in India is stunning.",
              "Its economic growth has been among the highest in the world over the past two decades, lifting of millions of people out of poverty.",

              "Coal and oil have so far served as bedrocks of India\u2019s industrial growth and modernisation, giving a rising number of Indian people access to modern energy services.",
              "This includes adding new electricity connections for 50 million citizens each year over the past decade.",
              "The rapid growth in fossil energy consumption has also meant India\u2019s annual CO2 emissions have risen to become the third highest in the world.",
              "However, India\u2019s CO2 emissions per person put it near the bottom of the world\u2019s emitters, and they are lower still if you consider historical emissions per person.",
              "The same is true of energy consumption: the average household in India consumes a tenth as much electricity as the average household in the United States.",
              "India\u2019s sheer size and its huge scope for growth means that its energy demand is set to grow by more than that of any other country in the coming decades.",
              "In a pathway to net zero emissions by 2070, we estimate that most of the growth in energy demand this decade would already have to be met with low-carbon energy sources.",
              "It therefore makes sense that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced more ambitious targets for 2030, including installing 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, reducing the emissions intensity of its economy by 45%, and reducing a billion tonnes of CO2.",
              "These targets are formidable, but the good news is that the clean energy transition in India is already well underway.",
              "It has overachieved its commitment made at COP 21- Paris Summit by already meeting 40% of its power capacity from non-fossil fuels- almost nine years ahead of its commitment and the share of solar and wind in India\u2019s energy mix have grown phenomenally.",
              "Owing to technological developments, steady policy support and a vibrant private sector solar power plants are cheaper to build than coal ones.",
              "Renewable electricity is growing at a faster rate in India than any other major economy, with new capacity additions on track to double by 2026.",
              "The country is also one of the world\u2019s largest producers of modern bioenergy and has big ambitions to scale up its use across the economy.",
              "The IEA expects India to overtake Canada and China in the next few years to become the third largest ethanol market worldwide after the United States and Brazil.",

              "The pace of economic recovery, heightened pressure on public budgets and the financial health of the energy sector as a whole further exacerbate already existing policy uncertainties and financing challenges.",

              "Those have limited risk of cancellation and thus are expected to become operational in 2020 and 2021, with some facing further delays carrying over to 2022 or beyond.",
              "In the next five years, almost half of wind and solar PV projects in the pipeline are tied to planned, but not finalised, government-backed auctions or other incentives such as tax credits, rebates and FITs.",
              "The Covid-19 crisis poses challenges to the timely implementation of previously announced government plans.",
              "For instance, the implementation of projects under government-backed auctions will critically depend on whether countries maintain their planned schedule of tenders.",
              "This may be unlikely in the context of stalling or decreasing electricity demand, and low fossil fuel prices.",
              "Planned renewable electricity projects with long-term contracts will be mostly shielded from low natural gas prices.",
              "Although in the short term, governments may delay scheduling new renewable capacity auctions and turn to existing natural gas plants to meet new demand, in the medium and long term the economic case of wind and solar remains strong thanks to expected continuing cost reductions and to the long-term price predictability over project lifetimes.",
              "Some impacts on policies are already visible.",
              "Initial government policies to tackle Covid-19 challenges have focused mainly on extending project-commissioning deadlines and postponing planned auctions.",
              "France, the United Kingdom, Greece and Germany have provided some flexibility for developers who are not able to meet policy-related final commissioning dates.",
              "While these measures protect deployment in 2020 and 2021, the delay of auctions will also have an impact beyond 2021.",

              "Recent policy changes affecting renewables beyond 2021 With the declining cost of renewables, corporates have increasingly signed power purchase contracts directly with wind and solar projects outside the main government policy schemes to meet their private decarbonisation goals and also to hedge against future price volatility.",
              "Developers of wind and solar projects entering these agreements have accepted additional risk from shorter contracts and greater exposure to wholesale electricity prices.",
              "While project development tied to private agreements accounts for about a quarter of projects in the pipeline, lower electricity demand, plummeting power prices and a weaker financing environment may lead to such projects being reconsidered.",
              "At the same time, the hedging value of renewables to both electricity price volatility and climate liabilities remains intact.",
              "Most renewables for electricity generation, especially wind and solar PV, have high investment costs but low operating and maintenance costs.",
              "Once operational, renewables projects with long-term power purchase contracts can provide stable revenues to investors while sheltering buyers from future electricity and fuel price volatility.",
              "The willingness of corporates to continue procuring renewables in a low fossil fuel price environment will also strongly depend on the ambition of their own climate change mitigation policies and on carbon pricing regimes implemented by governments.",
              "In the case of the EU policy framework for biofuels, the Renewable Energy Directive dictates that member states may increase the contribution of conventional (crop-based) biofuels to renewable energy in transport by no more than one percentage point over levels achieved in 2020.",
              "As such, any Covid-19 market disruption this year that alters the share of conventional biofuels consumed would affect the maximum permitted share in member states well beyond 2020.",
              "A sustained period of low oil prices heightens the possibility of policy makers delaying or abandoning increases in biofuel policy support.",

              "A major worldwide push to increase energy efficiency is an essential part of these efforts, resulting in the annual rate of energy intensity improvements averaging 4% to 2030 \u2013 about three-times the average rate achieved over the last two decades.",
              "Emissions reductions from the energy sector are not limited to CO2: in our pathway, methane emissions from fossil fuel supply fall by 75% over the next ten years as a result of a global, concerted effort to deploy all available abatement measures and technologies.",

              "In our pathway, around 5 million jobs are lost.",
              "Most of those jobs are located close to fossil fuel resources, and many are well paid, meaning structural changes can cause shocks for communities with impacts that persist over time.",

              "Yet annual per capita income from oil and natural gas in producer economies falls by about 75%, from USD 1 800 in recent years to USD 450 by the 2030s, which could have knock-on societal effects.",
              "Structural reforms and new sources of revenue are needed, even though these are unlikely to compensate fully for the drop in oil and gas income.",
              "While traditional supply activities decline, the expertise of the oil and natural gas industry fits well with technologies such as hydrogen, CCUS and offshore wind that are needed to tackle emissions in sectors where reductions are likely to be most challenging.",
