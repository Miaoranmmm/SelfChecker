    "query": "What is the historical and cultural significance behind the intricate art of traditional Indian textile weaving, and how has it influenced fashion and design in modern times?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. Traditional Indian textile weaving has a long and rich history that dates back to the Indus Valley civilization[^1^] [^4^]. India has a diverse and vibrant textile tradition that reflects its cultural and geographical diversity. Different regions have developed their own distinctive styles of weaving, dyeing, printing and embroidering fabrics using natural materials and techniques[^5^].\n\nTraditional Indian textile weaving has also influenced fashion and design in modern times, both within and outside India. Some of the ways it has done so are:\n\n- It has inspired many Indian designers to use traditional fabrics, motifs and techniques in their creations, such as khadi, ikat, bandhani, kantha, chikankari and more. These designers have also experimented with new forms, colours and combinations to create contemporary and innovative designs that appeal to global audiences[^7^].\n- It has also attracted many international designers and brands to collaborate with Indian artisans and craftspersons, or to source fabrics and materials from India. For example, Chanel, Dior, Hermes, Gucci and others have used Indian textiles such as silk, cotton, brocade, embroidery and block prints in their collections[^6^].\n- It has also become a symbol of social and political movements, such as the Swadeshi movement led by Mahatma Gandhi in the 20th century. Gandhi promoted khadi as a way of self-reliance, economic empowerment and resistance against colonialism. He encouraged people to spin, weave and wear khadi as a sign of patriotism and solidarity[^8^]. Khadi is still worn by many Indians today as a mark of pride and identity[^6^].",

              "Moreover, women weaver\u2019s success in establishing themselves as traditional handloom weavers within the Ri-Bhoi cultural context arose from meaning developed through social interaction with others in the Ri-Bhoi community.",

              "Examining other tribal communities in NERI to compare and contrast cultural diversities among tribes in the region also might provide valuable information, as findings related to the weaving traditions of one tribe cannot be generalized to another.",

              "Weavers and traditional textile designers have been weaving and stitching stories into our textiles since forever.",

              "In the first part of the exhibition, put up online in April 2021, the focus was on kantha, a centuries-old tradition of stitching patchwork cloth to repurpose old fabric.",
              "The curators \u2013 Kambadur and Ahldag \u2013 treated this technique as an artistic practice and labour done by women in their homes.",
              "They looked at the many ways that old fabrics found new life in table-cloths, bed covers and baby wraps and the motifs and stories from their immediate surroundings that made it onto these garments and fabrics.",
              "Besides tracking the journey of this humble thrifting technique from a gifting culture to its commercialisation and into fashion.",
              "\u201cThis is the most important motivation of these exhibitions for us,\u201d says Ahldag, the museum\u2019s associate curator, \u201cfocusing on the makers and the making of these materials.",
              "And allowing for the kinds of stories these makers tell us of the world at that time and now through these textiles to come through.",
              "\u201d In this part of the on-going textile exhibition that looks at ikat and bandhani \u2013 fabrics created by knots and weaves \u2013 \u201cthe focus isn\u2019t on technique but the transformation of the textiles when they go from one context to another,\u201d Ahldag tells us.",
              "\u201cLike how a Gujarati wedding patola woven specifically for that ceremonial purpose, when it enters the trade market, finds itself in Indonesia being used during religious functions,\u201d she says, as an example of these changing contexts of [the] cloth showcased in the exhibition.",
              "These possible points of commerce end up influencing these techniques itself, which informs another layer of the exhibition\u2019s items. Ahldag admits, on occasion reaching to speculation and studied guesswork to answer questions surrounding these newer contexts.",
              "(An interesting detail in this exhibition that is captured in bite-sized conversations of personal concerns between the curators.)",
              "\u201cSometimes, these textiles landed up in different countries through gifting and no one did the labour of noting down details of the master weaver, which community or even point of origin,\u201d she says.",
              "This is a kind of trouble they seem to run into a lot when it comes to these objects.",
              "The curators work around this crease in their well-laid plans by \u201clooking at the influences and relationship between textiles.",
              "Then, contextualising these tangents within the gamut of our collection at large to see if these contexts were reflected in miniature paintings or early studio photos,\u201d she adds.",
              "Knots & Weaves is divided into two parts, the first one looks at ikat items from the museum\u2019s collection.",
              "It starts with the most impressive ikat robe woven in Uzbekistan from the late 19th or early 20th century.",
              "\u201cWe thought this was the most relatable way to begin the exhibition,\u201d says Kambadur, assistant curator at the museum, while taking us on a virtual tour, \u201cbecause most of us have this similar kind of warp ikat \u2013 which gives it that blurry sense from top to bottom \u2013 in our wardrobes too.",
              "\u201d It then moves onto a tubular skirt from Thailand, which is a rarer example of weft ikat, which gives it a blurry sense from left to right.",
              "Other materials, like a silk patola saree woven in a vohra-gaji bhat or betel leaf pattern which was made in the 19th century in Gujarat, for the Indian market and its translations that accommodated for the Indonesian market.",
              "Or even examples of these takes on traditional designs that instead of being woven were made using block printing technique or the gold being swapped for dyes to create \u201cimitation ikat\u201d on cotton fabric for the mass markets in South-East Asia, who were wearing them as sarongs.",
              "An aubergine silk sari with the most intricate bandhani work kicks off the second part of this exhibition.",
              "At first glance, one might simply be dazzled with the quality of the dye work but zooming into the image reveals a floral detail that\u2019s delicious and divine.",
              "In selecting these specific items, the two curators wanted to break away from the everydayness of this textile and showcase it at its most skilled.",
              "This technique finds its way into the exhibition because of the curators\u2019 love for the way the body of women becomes an integral part of the making of bandhani textiles.",
              "\u201cWomen would sometimes grow a really long fingernail and use that to tie these tiny knots.",
              "Or they would use items from their kitchens like rice grains or mustard seeds to achieve this level of fine work,\u201d explains Ahldag.",
              "In curating the bandhani items for this part of Knots & Weaves, the curators wanted to also have us understand the ways that different qualities of this technique found themselves being used across the board.",
              "Using miniature paintings and studio photos, they point us to the developments in this living textile technique to respond to its times.",
              "Knots & Weaves can be appreciated on the surface, much like we do with our clothes, through images that allow for detailed interaction and a closer look.",

              "At last month's Lakme\u0301 Fashion Week in India, conversations about making fashion more sustainable took centre-stage.",
              "But are the country's designers ready for this?",
              "The four-day event - organised jointly by beauty company Lakme\u0301, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Brands and the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) - is one of Indian fashion's biggest highlights.",
              "While it had all the essential ingredients - glittering catwalks, clinking wine glasses and fashionistas in the front row - what grabbed eyeballs was a competition encouraging young designers to use eco-friendly materials to create outfits.",
              "The event is part of a wider ambition among Indian designers aiming to make sustainability the driving factor of their businesses.",
              "Many say they are trying to shrink their brands' environmental footprint - some are completely shifting to reusable materials, experimenting with fabrics made from used carpet or agricultural waste and eco-prints of plants and flowers.",
              "But experts say a lot more needs to be done, given the magnitude of the challenge.",
              "India's fashion industry is expected to grow at a staggering rate to reach $115-125bn by 2025, making it an important player on the global stage.",
              "Like elsewhere, it's the fast fashion market which is blamed for incurring maximum damage but experts say some of the responsibility also lies with the luxury segment.",
              "More so since this segment has been growing rapidly in recent years, propelled by an emerging crop of young Indians with higher disposable incomes.",
              "\"Big designers have fashion shows every year and new collections every season, which means they too are creating clothes at a constant pace,\" says Pooja Singh, fashion and luxury editor at Mint Lounge newspaper.",
              "So increasingly, the industry is facing repeated allegations of hypocrisy - of causing too much damage and doing very little to combat it.",
              "Critics say Indian designers sometimes use terms such as sustainability and eco-friendly for marketing campaigns without actually practising what they preach.",
              "Some designers reject the accusation, but other industry insiders agree it is a serious challenge.",
              "Jaspreet Chandok, group vice-president of Reliance Brands which has invested heavily in the luxury market in recent years, says there's no simple answer to how luxury fashion can tackle climate change because everything is \"work in progress\".",
              "\"But what we do bring to the table are innovative materials and technologies to bridge the gap between luxury and sustainability,\" he says.",
              "Implementing these changes, he says, will take time, and the solution cannot be to ask people to stop making or buying new things.",
              "\"After all, the industry allows people to express themselves and brings so much joy.",
              "It also provides employment to millions of workers.\"",
              "While sustainability is often seen as only related to the environment, in the Indian context, it should also include improving the working conditions of artisans who form the backbone of the fashion market.",
              "Some of the biggest names on the runways of Paris and Milan quietly rely on these highly-skilled workers to produce their fabulous hand-made outfits and India is one of the largest exporters of garments and textiles at $44.",
              "4bn.",
              "But there have been allegations that they work in exploitative conditions, a trend which critics say has continued under Indian labels.",
              "In 2020, The New York Times reported that one of India's best-known designers was facing legal action from workers over unpaid wages.",
              "Mr Chandok, however, says that a lot has been done to tackle the problem and workers are receiving better pay and opportunities.",
              "But labour unions have said that there is still a long way to go before fair working conditions are achieved.",
              "Ms Singh says that making fashion sustainable is a complicated process and there are no straight answers for the best way to achieve it.",
              "\"The simple solution would be to produce less but in the end, it's a business with jobs of millions tied into it.\"",
              "Using eco-friendly clothing is also not a silver-bullet solution.",
              "Fabrics like recycled polyester and those made from wood pulp have a lower carbon footprint, but they too have an environmental cost as their production could lead to deforestation, Ms Singh says.",
              "The onus, she says, also lies on consumers to make mindful choices.",
              "Things have changed a little after the Covid-19 pandemic with more people becoming mindful of protecting the environment and making sustainable choices, including when it comes to fashion.",
              "The industry has already started responding to this changing trend - FDCI chairperson Sunil Sethi says many designers are choosing to focus on one collection a year instead of seasonal ones.",
              "Even celebrities are embracing the idea of pre-loved clothing and repeating outfits.",
              "The process is slow but, he says, every step is a way forward.",
              "Mr Sethi says that designers have also found new ways of defining luxury, where the focus is not on creating more but less.",
              "He calls it \"slow luxury\", or garments that are crafted by hand, slowly and methodically, to create ensembles that outlive seasonal trends, almost like an heirloom that can be handed down from one generation to another.",
              "That's exactly the sort of fashion that renowned Indian designers Abraham and Thakore are known for.",
              "Called the \"quiet revolutionaries\" of the fashion world, the designers are credited with reinventing Indian couture by experimenting with eco-friendly fabrics, while staying rooted in traditional textiles and crafts.",
              "\"It's simple - short-term trend is just not the solution to anything,\" Mr Thakore told the BBC.",
              "\"When you create something unique and signature, it automatically becomes non-disposable.",

              "By Kai Schultz, Elizabeth Paton and Phyllida Jay MUMBAI, India \u2014 At the top of a staircase covered in dirt and sequins, several dozen Indian artisans hunched over yards of fabric, using needles to embroider garments for the world\u2019s most powerful fashion brands.",
              "They sewed without health benefits in a multiroom factory with caged windows and no emergency exit, where they earned a few dollars a day completing subcontracted orders for international designers.",
              "When night fell, some slept on the floor.",
              "They were not working for a factory employed by fast fashion brands: companies whose business model is premised on producing trendy clothing as cheaply as possible and whose supply chain issues came under scrutiny in 2013.",
              "That was when the deadliest garment industry disaster in history, the Rana Plaza factory collapse, killed more than 1,100 Bangladeshi workers.",
              "Their products were destined for Dior and Saint Laurent, among other luxury names.",
              "Unknown to most consumers, the expensive, glittering brands of runways in Paris and Milan also indirectly employ thousands of workers in the developing world.",
              "In Mumbai, scores of ateliers and export houses act as middlemen between the brands and highly skilled artisans, while also providing services like design, sampling and garment production.",
              "As with fast fashion retailers, many luxury brands do not own all of their own production facilities, and instead contract with independent factories to make their garments or embroider them.",
              "And like fast fashion, they too have woken up to potential dangers with that system.",
              "In 2016, a group of luxury houses introduced the Utthan pact, an ambitious and secretive compliance project aimed at ensuring factory safety in Mumbai and elevating Indian embroiderers.",
              "Among the signatories were Kering (owner of labels including Gucci and Saint Laurent);",
              "LVMH Louis Vuitton Moe\u0308t Hennessy (owner of Fendi and Christian Dior);",
              "and two British fashion houses, Burberry and Mulberry.",
              "The pact had an initial three-year timeline but was not legally binding.",
              "Yet during visits to several Mumbai factories, and in more than three dozen interviews with artisans, factory managers and designers, The New York Times found that embroiderers still completed orders at unregulated facilities that did not meet Indian factory safety laws.",
              "Many workers still do not have any employment benefits or protections, while seasonal demands for thousands of hours of overtime would coincide with the latest fashion weeks in Europe.",
              "Several factory owners said that membership in the pact meant investing in the costly compliance standards outlined by the Utthan pact, while brands simultaneously drove down what they would pay for orders.",
              "\u201cGiven the product prices, there is a sense that the luxury brands must be doing it right, and that makes them immune to public scrutiny,\u201d said Michael Posner, a professor of ethics and finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University.",
              "\u201cBut despite the price tags for luxury brand goods, the conditions in factories across their supply chains can be just as bad as those found in factories producing for fast fashion retailers.",
              "\u201d When contacted for comment, luxury brands that were Utthan signatories largely highlighted the broader improvements made by the implementation of the pact, rather than focusing on continuing issues and accusations.",
              "\u201cWe recognize that the situation of some workers at the subcontracting level is still very far from satisfying today, and we are genuinely determined to strengthen the program with our fellow stakeholders, to speed up progress and to further improve the situation,\u201d a Kering spokesman said in a statement.",
              "A spokesman for LVMH Moe\u0308t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world\u2019s largest luxury goods company, said in an emailed statement: \u201cWe take the allegations raised through your questions very seriously but are unable to comment without further details and a thorough investigation.",
              "\u201d Since the 1980s, luxury brands have quietly outsourced much of their embroidery work to India.",
              "The country is one of the world\u2019s largest garment exporters, with a textiles market worth $150 to $250 billion, according to the India Brand Equity Foundation, a trust established by the Indian government\u2019s commerce ministry.",
              "India\u2019s embroiderers, known by the Urdu word \u201ckarigar,\u201d which means \u201cartisan,\u201d are among the best in the world.",
              "Formalized during Mughal rule, which spanned two centuries from the mid-1500s, karigars have passed their art form across generations.",
              "Today they are largely Muslim men who migrated from rural India to Mumbai, where they are paid meager sums to work up to 17 hours a day, many in overcrowded slums. Few have access to education or public services, yet their work has value with fashion companies abroad.",
              "Western designers have brought some of their most important embroidery work to India in recent years, including Alessandro Michele\u2019s exuberant collections for Gucci, emblazoned with tigers and butterflies;",
              "Dior\u2019s embellished saddle bags;",
              "and red carpet looks for Lady Gaga, Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Jennifer Lopez, whose 2019 jungle print Versace dress was embroidered in Mumbai.",
              "By 2019, India\u2019s embroidery exports exceeded $230 million, a nearly 500 percent increase from two decades ago, according to the government\u2019s commerce ministry.",
              "But as scrutiny of supply chains grew after the Rana Plaza disaster, luxury brands became nervous about their ties to India, a country known for weak worker protections, where building collapses and factory fires regularly kill and maim garment workers, and Utthan, which takes its name from a Sanskrit word that roughly translates to \u201cupliftment,\u201d was established.",
              "At least seven Indian export houses \u2014 middlemen between local embroidery factories and international brands \u2014 also joined.",
              "The project proposed sweeping changes to Mumbai\u2019s factories by standardizing wages and improving workplace safety.",
              "However, unlike with many luxury initiatives, including sustainability and ethical business practices, the brands did not publicize their involvement in Utthan.",
              "They did not mention it in their annual reports or corporate and social responsibility platforms, and some discouraged auditors from speaking about it.",
              "At least two signatories said they were asked to sign nondisclosure agreements.",
              "Managed by Impactt, a consultancy in London, the agreement delineated targets for Indian export houses, which typically have their own factories.",
              "But when deadlines are tight and the work orders exceed what their factories can produce, the export houses subcontract.",
              "They take embroidery work to small businesses like those visited by The Times, where wages are frequently paid in cash and facilities fail to meet safety codes.",
              "According to a 2016 publication from Impactt that laid out Utthan\u2019s requirements, within three years, every Indian subcontractor employed by signatories would be required to show progress in providing health and pension benefits to artisans.",
              "All factories would need fire extinguishers, a separate room for workers to sleep in and for bigger facilities at least two signposted exits.",
              "To meet India\u2019s labor laws, the Utthan pact also called for a maximum six-day week for artisans, a workday of no more than 11 hours \u2014 in line with the legal limit \u2014 and reduced overtime.",
