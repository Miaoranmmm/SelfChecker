    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. That's a great question. There are many surprising facts about the human brain that are rarely known to the general public. Here are some of them:\n\n- The brain uses less power than a refrigerator light. The brain uses 12 watts of power - 17% of the body's energy[^5^].\n- The brain is 73% water. It takes only 2% dehydration to affect your attention, memory and other cognitive skills[^2^] [^4^].\n- The brain can't feel pain. It interprets pain signals sent to it, but it does not feel pain[^2^].\n- The brain is the most fatty organ in the body. Sixty percent of the dry weight is fat[^2^]. Cholesterol is key to learning and memory, but high cholesterol has different effects depending on your age and other factors[^2^].\n- The brain\u2019s storage capacity is considered virtually unlimited. It has about one hundred billion neurons, each with 1,000 to 10,000 synapses[^1^] [^2^].\n- The brain isn't fully formed until age 25. The prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision making and impulse control, is one of the last areas to mature[^1^].\n- The brain information travels up to an impressive 268 miles per hour. This is faster than Formula 1 race cars which top out at 240 mph[^1^].\n- The brain begins to lose some memory abilities as well as some cognitive skills by your late 20s[^2^]. However, the brain can form new neural pathways throughout life if it is challenged and stimulated[^2^].\n\nI hope you found these facts interesting and informative.",

              "The study researchers found that tiny sacs called vesicles that hold messages being transmitted between brain cells may be constantly oozing energy, and that leakage is likely a trade-off for the brain being ready to fire at all times, according to a new study published Dec.",
              "3 in the journal Science Advances.",
              "\"The brain is considered a very expensive organ to run,\" said senior author Timothy Ryan, a professor of biochemistry at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.",
              "Related: 10 things you didn't know about the brain Scientists previously assumed this energy suck had to do with the fact that the brain is electrically active, which means that brain cells, or neurons, are constantly firing electrical signals to communicate, a process that burns large amounts of an energy molecule known as adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP).",
              "But over the past couple of decades, clinical studies showed that the brains of people who were in a vegetative state or coma, meaning very minimal electrical brain activity, still consumed massive amounts of energy, Ryan told Live Science.",
              "So neuroscientists were faced with a conundrum: If electrical activity isn't using up all the energy in the brain, what is?",
              "In recent years, Ryan and his team have been researching junctions in the brain called synapses, where neurons meet and communicate by launching tiny vesicles packed with chemical messengers called neurotransmitters.",
              "They previously showed that active synapses use up a lot of energy.",
              "But in a new study, in which they inactivated rat neuron synapses in lab dishes with a toxin and then measured ATP levels inside the synapses, the team realized that synapses consumed a lot of energy even when neurons weren't firing.",
              "To figure out why, they knocked out various pumps on the surfaces of the tiny vesicles that move neurotransmitters and other molecules in and out, and so deprived synapses of fuel.",
              "They imaged the synapses using a fluorescent microscope and figured out how much ATP the synapse had burned.",
              "They found that a \"proton pump\" was responsible for about 44% of all the energy used in the resting synapse.",
              "When they dug further, the researchers discovered that the proton pump had to keep working, and burning ATP, because the vesicles were always \"leaking\" protons.",
              "Inactive synapses prepare to launch these vesicles at a moment's notice by pre-packing them with neurotransmitters.",
              "They do that with the help of another pump that sits on the surfaces of the vesicles.",
              "This type of pump, called transporter proteins, change shape to carry neurotransmitters inside and in exchange, they grab a proton from inside the vesicle, change shape again and spit the proton out of the vesicle.",
              "For this process to work, the vesicles must have a higher concentration of protons inside than in its surroundings.",
              "But the researchers found that even after the vesicles were full of neurotransmitters, the transporter proteins continued to change shape.",
              "Even though they weren't carrying neurotransmitters into the vesicles, they continued to spit protons out, requiring the proton pump to keep working to refill the vesicle's reservoir of protons.",

              "Despite the lack of behavioural changes in cognition, neural activity in brain regions involved in attention and executive function has been shown to increase when individuals are mildly dehydrated than when they are euhydrated( Reference Kempton, Ettinger and Foster 38 ).",
              "One explanation is that individuals compensate for dehydration at both the neural and behavioural levels through investing greater effort and mental energy( Reference Gorby, Brownawell and Falk 60 ), thus producing no net performance changes.",

              "Within the context of acute water intervention, by alleviating the state of thirst and dehydration, these states no longer require allocation of resources, thus allowing parallel processes to recruit the required resources.",
              "This shift in cognitive resource allocation may provide the mechanism for performance change in cognitive tasks after water consumption.",
              "Support for this mechanism can be found in studies that demonstrated improvements in cognitive performance after hydration, with the level of thirst mediating the effect( Reference Edmonds, Crombie and Gardner 52 , Reference Rogers, Kainth and Smit 64 ).",
              "However, an alternative interpretation is that the state of thirst could be an indication of mild dehydration that could subsequently induce physiological changes, similar to those observed in brain imaging data( Reference Kempton, Ettinger and Foster 38 ) such as total brain volume shrinkage.",
              "Future studies focusing on this potential mechanism will help us to decipher whether it is the influence of thirst itself or the consequence of dehydration that underlies any changes in cognitive performance.",
              "Potential physiological mechanisms for performance improvements after water intervention are based on theorised physiological changes as a result of water consumption.",
              "To date, researchers have not explored these mechanisms. The importance of physiological mechanisms, in addition to psychological mechanism, is underscored by a recent study carried out by Edmonds et al.",
              "( Reference Edmonds, Crombie and Ballieux 66 ).",
              "The researchers manipulated expectancy by informing half of the participants about the beneficial effects of water consumption on cognitive performance during either a no-water or water consumption period.",
              "Cognitive improvements were found after water intervention, with no influence of expectancy.",
              "The authors posit that these findings reveal the lack of influence that expectancy has on cognitive improvements after water intervention and provide support for physiological mechanisms. To date, it is still unclear as to what hydration state participants in empirical studies reviewed above actually experience.",
              "With a lack of objective measurement, it is not known whether individuals experience mild dehydration at baseline or a euhydrated state.",
              "With evidence to suggest that even mild dehydration states are associated with significant changes at the neural level, such as total brain volume shrinkage and over-recruitment of specific brain areas during cognitively demanding tasks( Reference Kempton, Ettinger and Foster 38 ), it may be possible that providing mildly dehydrated participants with water may be reversing this effect.",
              "With a lack of data related to baseline hydration states of individuals and no further published work using imaging techniques to examine hydration state, these proposed mechanisms are merely speculative.",
              "Another physiological mechanism to consider is the reactivity of the cardiovascular system after acute water consumption( Reference May and Jordan 82 ).",
              "Reduced heart rate and vasodilation have been found in young adults after drinking 500 ml of water, whereas a significant blood pressure increase has been observed in healthy older adults( Reference Schroeder, Bush and Norcliffe 83 ).",
              "This cardiovascular reactivity probably promotes cerebral blood flow, which will encourage the circulation of substances such as oxygen and glucose known to stimulate neural activity and associated behavioural performance( Reference Gold 84 ), a mechanism similar to that suggested for cognitive function improvements due to physical exercise( Reference Kashihara, Maruyama and Murota 85 ).",
              "Future studies should consider using neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI and perfusion to understand how cardiovascular changes can be related to neural activity changes and thus how these influence cognitive performance.",
              "Accumulating evidence supports the notion that hydration state affects cognitive ability and mood.",
              "Severe dehydration has been shown to cause cognitive deficits such as short-term memory and visual perceptual abilities as well as mood disturbance, whereas water consumption can improve cognitive performance, particularly visual attention and mood.",
              "This research field is still in its infancy and fundamentally there is still a high amount of variability with regard to cognitive findings in both dehydration and acute water intervention studies.",
              "Researchers should investigate why this variability occurs and what the optimum conditions are for hydration state to affect cognitive performance.",
              "In this review, we have highlighted the importance of controlling for any potential confounding factors that may occur due to experimental design, exercise/heat stress protocols used in dehydration studies or conditions related to acute water intervention such as water temperature.",
              "Other advancements include taking into account the mechanisms that may underlie the observed performance changes: conducting behavioural studies with physiological markers to monitor hydration state such as urine indices and neuroimaging studies to discover the underlying neural events during hydration state change.",
              "Standardising cognitive testing would also help advance knowledge in this field.",
              "The topic is highly relevant for public health and engages with a wide audience, and this research has the potential to pave the way for intervention programmes in public arenas, improving people's quality of life.",

              "All the cells in the body, including our brain cells, depend on this water to carry out essential functions.",
              "Therefore, if water levels are too low, our brain cells cannot function properly, leading to cognitive problems.

              "In young women, cognitive deficits can be readily reversed by replenishing fluids [5], while in the elderly, the prolonged cellular stress of dehydration may promote brain pathology and continued cognitive decline.",

              "The elderly are also less likely to notice they are dehydrated.",

              "Therefore, this review article aims to put in place a thorough understanding of major pain conditions that we experience\u2014nociceptive, inflammatory and physiologically dysfunction, such as neuropathic pain and its modulation and feedback systems. Moreover, the complete mechanism of conduction is compiled within this article, elucidating understandings from various researches and breakthroughs.",

              "The sensation of pain is associated with the activation of the receptors in the primary afferent fibers, which is inclusive of the unmyelinated C-fiber and myelinated A\u03c3-fiber.",
              "Both nociceptors remain silent during homeostasis in the absence of pain and are activated when there is a potential of noxious stimulus.",
              "The perception of a series of sensory events is required for the brain in order to detect pain and produce a response towards the threat.",
              "There are generally three main stages in the perception of pain.",
              "The first stage is pain sensitivity, followed by the second stage where the signals are transmitted from the periphery to the dorsal horn (DH), which is located in the spinal cord via the peripheral nervous system (PNS).",

              "The PNS comprises nerves and ganglia that are located outside the brain and spinal cord, mainly functioning to connect the CNS to organs and limbs in our body.",
              "On the other hand, the CNS is composed of the spinal cord and the brain, which is mainly responsible for integrating and intepreting the information sent from the PNS, and subsequently coordinating all the activities in our bodies, before sending response towards the effector organs.",
              "Fundamentally, the basic pain mechanism undergoes three events\u2014transduction, transmission and modulation when there is a presence of noxious stimuli.",

              "and (3) electrical events in the neurons are transduced as chemical events at the synapses.",
              "After the completion of transduction, the following mechanism would be transmission.",
              "It takes place by transmitting the electrical events along the neuronal pathways, while neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft transmit information from a post-synaptic terminal of one cell to a pre-synaptic terminal of another.",
              "Meanwhile, the modulation event takes place at all level of nociceptive pathways through the primary afferent neuron, DH and higher brain center by up- or down-regulation.",

              "The synaptic signals sent from a neuron are received by the dendrites and soma (synaptic transmission) of another neuron, and these signals could be inhibitory or excitatory in nature, defined by the pharmacological effects resulting from the signal itself.",
              "After receiving the signals via the dendrites or soma, the signals are transmitted within the neurons by axons.",
              "This leads to brief pulses generated within the neuron, known as an action potential, which propagate from the soma, travel along the axons to activate the synapses, and are then sent to other neurons, acting as a pathway to carry the signals from its source to either the spinal cord or the brain, where a response is ultimately interpreted to be executed.",
              "There are two major classifications of specialized neurons: sensory neurons and motor neurons.",
              "The sensory neurons, which are located in the dermis and epidermis that function to react to stimulus-like touching, send these signals along when the stimulus is present, whereas the main job of the motor neurons is to receive the signals from the brain and spinal cord followed by producing responses causing muscle contractions, and to affect the glandular outputs, as shown in Figure 1.",
              "Without the presence of neurons within the nervous system to transmit signals, our body cannot react to dangerous stimuli from the environment.",
              "Axons are also known as nerve fibers, which are the main component of a neuron that functions to conduct action potentials in a unilateral direction from the dendrites to the axonal terminals, as well as from one neuron to another.",

              "The presence of the myelin sheath of an axon, known as the node of Ranvier, increases the propagation speed of the impulses, as they travel along the myelinated fiber via saltatory conduction (generation of action potential at each node of Ranvier) and acts as an insulator to prevent electrical impulses from leaving the axon during the transmission.",
              "For unmyelinated fibers, the impulses move continuously in a much slower pace, as compared to myelinated ones.",
              "For primary afferent neurons, the A\u03b4-fibers are myelinated, whereas the C-fibers are unmyelinated.",

              "Group A nerve fibers were classified by Erlanger and Gasser as fibers that are myelinated.",

              "The nerve fibers at the dorsal roots (Type IV afferent fibers) and postganglionic fibers in the ANS can be categorized in this group.",
              "All these fibers are mainly nociceptive in function, carrying the sensory information and assembling around 70% of the afferents nociceptive information, which then enters the spinal cord.",
              "C-fibers terminate in laminae I and II in the grey matter of the spinal cord [3].",
              "In terms of nociception, C-fibers nociceptors are polymodal, which are activated by thermal, mechanical and chemical stimuli.",
              "The activation of C-fibers is from poorly localized stimuli, such as burning sensation of the skin.",
              "In terms of neurochemistry, C-fibers can be classified as either peptidergic or non-peptidergic, and about 50% of these fibers express neuropeptides inclusive of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neurokinins and substance P (SP).",
              "Generally, the electrical impulses that travel along the axons can be projected in two ways\u2014the afferent or efferent nerve fibers.",
              "In the PNS, afferent nerve fibers are referred to as sensory neurons, of which axons carry the sensory information from regions of the body to the spinal cord, whereas the efferent nerve fibers in the PNS are preganglionic and postganglionic motor neurons that carry the impulses of motor-movement signals out from the spine to the peripheral effectors organs, which include the skeletal muscle and smooth muscles, as shown in Figure 1.",
              "In the PNS, the afferent neurons somas are located in the ganglia, and their axons transmit the electrical impulses from ganglion to ganglion and eventually back to the spine.",
              "The axons of sensory neurons that are located in the dorsal root are mainly responsible for transducing the somatosensory information via interaction with somatosensory receptors.",
              "Somatosensory is a complex sensory neuron pathway that mainly responds to external changes, namely, surface touch, auditory, and visual stimuli.",
              "The somatosensory receptors can be activated by these different stimuli that act on mechanoreceptors (including proprioception), nociceptors, thermoreceptors and chemoreceptors.",
              "The release of the neurotransmitters at the axon terminal is triggered upon the entrance of Ca2+, and the nociceptive signals are then carried and sent across different neurons by an action potential.",
              "There are two major potentials to play unique roles in the production of action potential that allows transmission of signals through the neurons.",
              "These are known as the resting potential and threshold potential of neurons.",
              "In the axon of a typical neuron, the resting potential and threshold potential are approximately \u221270 and \u221255 mV, respectively.",
              "There are more Na+ accumulated outside the cell than the K+ inside the cell, and thus the resting potential of the cells is negatively charged.",
              "The movement of these ions across the lipid bilayer membrane of the neurons is strictly dependent on the activation of different ion channels.",
              "The conformation of the ion channels can be changed in order to be activated or inactivated, thus allowing for the influx or efflux of specific ions.",
              "The action potential in neurons is illustration in Figure 2.",
              "The action potential in neurons.",
              "Once the nociceptors are stimulated by a noxious stimulus, two types of potential are generated and summated in the axon hillock, the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP) and excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP).",
              "Once the triggering threshold is reached, the action potential is then propagated through the axon along the neurons.",
              "Generally, the action potential starts, when Na+ enters through a voltage-activated Na+ channel (Nav), which creates the depolarizing nature of the membrane potential.",
              "When threshold potential is achieved, all the Nav channels that are located in the axon hillock are stimulated to open, leading to a complete depolarization till achieving peak potential (+40 mV) of the neurons.",
              "At this point, the Nav channels return to their resting state, and the voltage-activated K+ channels (Kv) are activated and opened to allow the efflux of K+, causing repolarization of the neurons.",
              "The shape of the action potential is stereotypical, which means that the amplitude and the time course for all the action potentials occurring in the cells are the same.",
              "The continuous efflux of K+ through the Kv and K+ leakage channels causes the membrane potential to hyperpolarize, during the supposedly refractory period of the neurons.",
              "Eventually, the K+ channels close and the Na+/K+ transporters restore the resting potential by allowing the entrance of three Na+ and exit of two K+.",
              "When the action potential travels to the axon terminal, the Ca2+ enters into the presynaptic terminal through the voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCC), hence causing the synaptic transmission [5,6].",
              "Synaptic transmissions are chemical events used to transmit the impulse between neurons.",
              "There is a gap between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, known as the synaptic cleft, where the chemical synapse occurs.",
              "The synaptic transmission begins with the arrival of the action potential at the presynaptic axon terminal.",
              "An action potential at the presynaptic terminal creates membrane depolarization, which causes the opening of Nav channels at the terminal.",
              "The entry of Na+ leads to further activation of the VOCC, allowing Ca2+ to enter into the axon terminal.",
              "These calcium ions bind to the calcium-sensing protein present at a said terminal, which subsequently interact with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor activating protein receptor (SNARE) proteins.",
              "The primary role of the SNARE proteins is to promote the fusion of the synaptic vesicles (also known as neurotransmitter vesicles) to the presynaptic axon terminal membrane in the neurons, which causes the immediate release of their contents including neurotransmitters and Ca2+ into the synaptic cleft via exocytosis.",
              "Free neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to their cognate ligand-gated ion channels that are located on the membrane of the adjacent postsynaptic neuron, causing a localized action potential at the axon of the second neuron.",
              "The impulse signals in this pathway can be passed from one neuron to in a unilateral direction, as shown in Figure 1.",
              "There are four possible ways to terminate the release of neurotransmitters.",
              "These methods include: (1) drift of the neurotransmitters away from the synaptic cleft after dissociating from its receptors;",
              "(2) removal of the neurotransmitters by the astroglia (glial cells) found in the synaptic cleft;",
              "(3) enzymatic degradation of the neurotransmitters;",
              "and (4) re-uptake of the neurotransmitters into the axon terminal that releases them.",
              "Fundamentally, pain transmission is strictly dependent on the balance of the excitatory and inhibitory influences that act on the neuron circuits of the somatosensory system.",
              "There are multiple levels of CNS involved in the transmission of pain.",
              "These include the spinal cord (supraspinal), the brainstem (midbrain, medulla oblongata and the pons), and the cortical regions (cerebral cortex), as shown in Figure 1.",
              "Typically, the DH of the spinal cord plays a crucial role in integrating multiple inputs entering the spine, including the primary afferent neurons and local interneuron networks, and is also responsible for the descending signals from the supraspinal center.",
              "Within the ascending system, primary afferent nociceptors are responsible for conveying the noxious information received to the projection neurons in the DH of the spinal cord.",
              "Following that, a subset of these projection neurons in turn transmit these sensory information up to the thalamus reaching the somatosensory cortex through the spinothalamic tract, thus providing information on the intensity and the location of the noxious stimulus.",
              "The spinothalamic tract is located in the white matter of spinal cord and consists of two parts\u2014the lateral spinothalamic and anterior spinothalamic tracts, which have different courses of function.",
              "The lateral spinothalamic tract focuses on transmission of the pain and temperature sensation, while the anterior spinothalamic tract carries information related to the crude touch and firm pressure sensation towards the thalamus in the brain.",
              "Other projection neurons engage the cingulate and insular cortices via the connections in the parabrachial nucleus and the amygdala, hence contributing to the pain experiences.",
              "As shown in Figure 1, this ascending information accesses the neurons of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and rostral ventral medulla (RVM) that is found in the midbrain to engage the descending feedback systems, in order to regulate the output from the spinal cord [4].",
              "The core function of the PAG is to integrate the information received from the higher centers of the brain, including the hypothalamus, amygdala and frontal lobe, as well as receiving the ascending nociceptive input from the DH.",
              "The PAG regulates the processing of the nociceptive information in the DH of the spinal cord via the projection neurons to RVM and dorsolateral pontine tegmentum (DLPT).",
              "The endogenous opioid and cannabinoid systems and other neurotransmitters, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE), are heavily expressed through the PAG/RVM pathways.",
              "Typically, pain can be classified into three types\u2014nociceptive, neuropathic and inflammatory pain, based on three characteristics, such as symptoms, mechanisms and syndromes.",
              "Nociception used interchangeably with nociperception is the response of our bodies\u2019 sensory nervous systems towards actual or potentially harmful stimuli.",
              "The sensory endings that are activated by such stimuli are known as nociceptors, which are mainly responsible for the first stage of pain sensations.",
              "Fundamentally, the A\u03b4- and C-fibers are two types of primary afferent nociceptors responding to noxious stimuli presented in our bodies\u2019 [7].",
              "Both these nociceptors have specialized free nerve endings that are widely located in the skin, muscle, joint capsule, bone and some major internal organs.",
              "They are functionally used to detect potentially damaging chemical, mechanical and thermal stimuli that might put us in harm\u2019s way.",
              "The major nociceptive pain can be categorized into two types including visceral somatic pain (which is further classified into two kinds: deep somatic and superficial pain).",
              "Both the A\u03b4- and C-fibers are mostly found in superficial organs, such as the skin, whereas other deep somatic structures, such as muscles and joints, are mainly supplied with C-fibers.",
              "A\u03b4-fibers are activated under thermal or mechanical stimuli and result in a short-lasting-pricking type of pain sensation.",
              "However, the activation of C-fibers is stimulated by thermal, mechanical or chemical stimuli, which often results in poor localization and dull pain sensation.",
              "There are three major roles for the receptors in the primary afferent neurons, which are excitatory, sensitizing and inhibitory response.",
              "Once these receptors are being stimulated and have reached the pain threshold, the resulting impulses are propagated along the afferent fibers towards the DH (PNS) and medulla (cranial).",
              "On top of that, there is an additional nociceptor known as silent nociceptors.",

              "The receptor of PGE2 can be divided into 4 major types, such as prostaglandin E2 receptor type 1\u20134 (EP1\u20134), whereas the receptor of PGI2 is termed prostacyclin receptor (IP).",
              "EP1 is Gq-protein coupled receptor, which leads to the PLC/IP3 and DAG/PKC signaling pathway, EP2, 4 and IP are Gs-protein-coupled receptors, which act on promotion of the AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathways upon activation, whereas EP3 is a Gi-protein-coupled receptor, which leads to inhibitory effects.",
              "In addition, PG enhances the effects of other chemical mediators, such as 5-HT and BK, as well as augments the neuropeptide, such as SP and CGRP, to be released.",
              "In other words, the increase of the BK induces the PG to be released and results in a \u201cself-sensitizing\u201d effect.",
              "LTB4 is one of the eicosanoid inflammatory mediators that are produced within the leukocytes.",
              "Upon injury caused by mechanical or thermal stimuli, the AA is broken down into 5-hydroperoxyicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) by lipooxygenase (LOX), and is subsequently hydrolyzed into LTB4 by leukotriene A4 (LTA4) hydrolase [76].",
              "LTB4 is mainly responsible for recruiting neutrophils towards the site of the damaged tissue, whilst simultaneously promoting the production of cytokines [77].",
              "In the presence of polymorphonuclear (PMNs) leucocytes, LTB4 can indirectly cause hyperalgesia probably through the afferent terminal pathway [19].",
              "LTB4 can cause sensitization of the nociceptors by increasing the cAMP/PKA activities.",
              "Some animal studies have speculated that the accumulation of inflammation-induced neutrophil is highly associated with the increasing number of LTB4, which causes the indirect stimulation of hyperalgesia.",
              "The site of injury is often more acidic than homeostasis, and hence the local content of protons shows a hike in number.",
              "The increasing number of these protons activates both the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and VR1 around the injury location.",
              "ASICs are neuronal voltage-insensitive Na+ channels, which are activated by extracellular protons.",
              "Typically, these channels respond to a low pH surrounding and are suggested by studies to be involved in the modulation of our bodies\u2019 mechano-sensation [78].",
              "Furthermore, there was research indicating the exposure of primary afferent nerve fibers to a pH lower than 6 can stimulate the ASICs [79].",
              "VR1 can also be activated by these protons (H+, pH < 5.",
              "5) via either heat stimuli or capsaicin.",
              "VR1\u2032s (a member of TRPV group of transient receptor potential family of ion channels) location in the dorsal roots of primary afferent nerves makes it mainly responsible for detection and regulation of the body\u2019s temperature, thus providing a burning sensation when stimulated by heat [80].",
              "Upon the activation of both the VR1 and ASICs, the presence of BK, PGE2 and histamine at the injury site can further increase the intracellular Ca2+ influx, hence enhancing the expression of VR1 and sensory neuron-specific (SNS) Na+ channels.",
              "Subsequently, the influx of the Na+ generates an action potential, thus causing sensitization of the afferent nerves.",
              "Although the rise of the intracellular Ca2+ leads to the release of the SP and CGRP, it can desensitize VR1 [81,82].",
              "ATP is an important intracellular messenger that is released locally by the damaged tissues and directly stimulates its receptors.",
              "This occurs when ATP is metabolized into adenosine by ectonucleotidases and binds to its receptor, ionotropic purino receptors (P2X) that are located at the peripheral site of the sensory neurons and centrally on the second-order neurons in the DH [30,32].",
              "In general, there are six types of P2X receptors, including P2X1\u20136 expressed in the sensory neurons.",
              "Amongst these six types, purino receptor type 3 (P2X3) receptors are one of the most selectively expressed receptors in the small C-fibered nociceptor.",
              "Once the ATP binds to the P2X3 receptors, Na+ can cross these channels and induce membrane depolarization, hence activating various Ca2+-sensitive intracellular processes and causing both pain and hyperalgesia.",
              "ATP can presynaptically act on the nociceptors to increase the release of glutamate.",
              "On the other hand, ATP produces a by-product from its metabolism, adenosine, which binds to either adenosine type 1 receptor (A1) Gi-PCRs for inhibitory action or binds to the adenosine type 2 receptor (A2) Gs-PCRs that are located peripherally and centrally to sensitize the nociceptors via the cAMP/PKA signaling pathways.",
              "The NGF is a neurotrophic factor of neuropeptide\u2014a well-known mediator for persistent pain, which is locally released at the site of injury by fibroblasts.",
              "After the inflammatory lesions are formed, the NGF is expressed rapidly and can induce a rapid onset of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia.",
              "NGF-dependent nerve fibers, known as tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), are also a high-affinity NGF receptor.",
              "This receptor is widely expressed in the primary afferent neurons with up to 50% coverage.",
              "which suggests its direct role in activation for peripheral sensitization.",
              "In addition, there are some non-neuronal cells including keratinocytes, mast cells and circulating eosinophils capable of expressing TrkA receptors and responding to the injury-induced NGF.",
              "For instance, NGF can cause mast cells degranulation and the release of 5-HT and histamine, as well as positively stimulate the release of more NGFs to enhance the inflammatory signals.",
              "Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitters in the vertebrate nervous system [83] that presents itself at the periphery inflammation sites, as well as contributes to over 50% of the brain synapses.",
              "It plays a crucial role in modulating nociception and neurotransmitter released from the terminal afferents.",
              "Theoretically, the sensory neurons express a full complement of the glutamate receptors, including alpha amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPA-R) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDA-R).",
              "Whilst it can be released by both the low- and high-threshold sensory afferent fibers to activate the C-fibers, these actions highlight the feedback mechanism, where the nociceptor excitability is enhanced by its own activity and probably causes an auto-regulation.",
              "The receptor of glutamate is NMDA-R, an ion channel that requires a specific combination of events in order to be activated, and results in the increase of the intracellular Ca2+, causing central sensitization [83].",
              "Upon being stimulated, glutamate is released by the sensory afferent fibers and acts via the AMPA-R, hence generating a rapid EPSP.",
              "The AMPA-R is a sodium-selective ion channel and its activation by the glutamate or amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) can subsequently generate a short-lived post-synaptic depolarization.",
              "After repeated stimulation, other tachykinin neuropeptides, such as SP, NKA and NKB, are co-released with glutamate and react with their receptors, such as NK1, NK2 and NK3, respectively, in which EPSP is prolonged.",
              "SP, NKA and NKB are grouped as tachykinin peptides with CGRP, predominating in the DH as excitatory peptide transmitters.",
              "This EPSP produces a sustained membrane depolarization, causing the Mg2+ that has blocked the pore of NMDA-R channel to be removed.",
              "In fact, NMDA-R is blocked by Mg2+ at normal physiological membrane potential.",
              "At this stage, the glutamate and glycine bind to activate the NMDA-R, resulting in calcium ion influx and causing hyperexcitability in the postsynaptic neurons [84].",
              "Furthermore, there are various effectors that can indirectly enhance the activation of NMDA-R.",
              "For instance, the intracellular Ca2+ influx through the NMDA-R causes a feedback to this receptor in order to increase the number of channels that are open.",
              "The increasing activity of the cAMP/PKA pathways via the production of PGE2 can further enhance the function of NMDA-R.",
              "NO can be produced by neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) from the l-arginine in the spinal cord neurons in CNS [54].",
              "Unlike other neurotransmitters, NO is mobile, free to diffuse from the neurons and enter other neurons to produce its second messenger through an enzymatic reaction.",
              "NO plays a crucial role in the transmission of nociceptive information after an inflammatory reaction, whilst stimulating the activation of NMDA-R.",
              "In short, the key second messengers mediated through activation of NMDA receptors are inclusive of cAMP, PKA, Ca2+ and PKC, which subsequently cause the increase of excitability of the DH neurons to respond towards weaker afferent nociceptive inputs.",
              "GABA is the most widely distributed inhibitory transmitter in a mammalian CNS.",
              "It contributes to about 40% of our brain synapses and can be found in the interneurons of the spinal cord, neocortex and cerebellum [85].",
              "It is produced by GABAergic neurons, which are concentrated in the brain.",
              "Within the nervous system, GABA can bind to the ionotropic GABAA-receptors or metabotropic GABAB-receptors, since they are widely found in the nervous system with GABAB and concentrated at the presynaptic nerve terminals as well as in the CNS.",
              "However, GABAA receptors are generally the receptor of choice for binding of GABA in the CNS because it is largely located there.",
              "When GABA binds to GABAA receptors, there is an inflow of extracellular Cl\u2212 into the neurons, thus reducing the membrane potential and resulting in an inhibitory effect.",
              "On the other hand, the binding of GABA to GABAB receptors causes an inhibition towards the formation of cAMP, because GABAB receptor is a Gi-protein-coupled receptor [60].",
              "The peptides that bind to the opioid receptors, such as \u03bc-opioid receptors (MOR), \u03b4-opioid receptors (DOR) and \u03ba-opioid receptors (KOR), are known as opioid peptides.",
              "All classes of the opioid receptors are Gi-protein-coupled receptors, which means they inhibit the AC/cAMP activity upon their activation.",
              "These receptors are widely distributed in both the primary afferent neurons and the dendrites of postsynaptic neurons, and there are two endogenous opioid peptides abundantly released into the interneurons of the DH: enkephalin and dynorphin.",
              "These peptides inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from the afferent terminals, hence reducing the excitability of neurons and overall mitigation of the pain sensation as an end result.",
              "Cannabinoid is one of the classes in the neurotransmitters that binds itself to its receptors and modulates the neurotransmitters released in the brain.",
              "The most common type of cannabinoid is the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is one of the major psychoactive components isolated from Cannabis sativa.",
              "Cannabinoids can bind to Gi-protein coupled cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1), which is highly expressed in the pre- and post-synaptic in brain and spinal cord [86,87], as well as the Gi-protein-coupled cannabinoid type 2 receptors (CB2) that is predominantly located in the immune system [69].",
              "The activation of CB1 and CB2 inhibits the formation of intracellular cAMP, hence leading to a tremendous reduction of the excitatory effect within the neurons [88,89].",
              "In addition, the activation of CB2 can further prevent the mast cell degranulation and the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, making the reduction in pain sensation even more drastic and effective.",
              "NE is the principal neurotransmitter of the adrenergic pathways and is synthesized from phenylalanine in the nerve terminals.",
              "Phenylalanine is converted into tyrosine and then into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxylase.",
              "DOPA is then further converted into dopamine, which is the precursor of NE that is stored in the vesicles of the nerve terminals.",
              "The receptors of NE include \u03b11-Gq\u03b1-, \u03b12-Gi\u03b1-, \u03b2-Gs\u03b1-protein-coupled receptors.",
              "\u03b11-Gq\u03b1- and \u03b2-Gs\u03b1-protein-coupled receptors are predominantly located in postsynaptic neurons, whereas \u03b12-Gi\u03b1-protein-coupled receptors are located in presynaptic neurons.",
              "Thus, the activation of the \u03b12-Gi\u03b1-protein-coupled receptors inhibits the Ca2+ influx, and causes the reduction of NE release out from the synapse.",
              "On the other hand, the binding of NE with \u03b11-Gq\u03b1- and \u03b2-Gs\u03b1-protein-coupled receptors that are located in the postsynaptic neurons stimulates the PLC/PKC and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways, respectively, and causes excitatory effects.",
              "In conclusion, understanding the complex mechanisms of pain is undoubtedly essential for pain research and pain management.",
              "Hence, the present review was comprehensively discussed based on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pain pathway as a whole picture.",
              "Moreover, the major types of neurotransmitters involved in the pain transduction, transmission and modulation have been completely elaborated along with their locations and eventual pharmacological effects.",

              "The purpose of the following review is to integrate the literature on the neurobiological pathways within the central, autonomic, and peripheral nervous systems that mediate pain processing, and discuss how psychological factors interact with physiology to modulate the experience of pain.",
              "When noxious stimuli impinge upon the body from external or internal sources, information regarding the damaging impact of these stimuli on bodily tissues is transduced through neural pathways and transmitted through the peripheral nervous system to the central and autonomic nervous systems. This form of information processing is known as nociception.",
              "Nociception is the process by which information about actual tissue damage (or the potential for such damage, should the noxious stimulus continue to be applied) is relayed to the brain.",
              "Nociception is mediated by specialized receptors known as nociceptors that are attached to thin myelinated A\u03b4 and unmyelinated C fibers, which terminate in the dorsal horn of the spine.",
              "Sufficiently intense mechanical stimulation (such as stretching, cutting, or pinching), intense warming of the skin, or exposure to noxious chemicals can activate nociceptors.",
              "2 In turn, activation of nociceptors is modulated by inflammatory and bio-molecular influences in the local extracellular environment.",
              "3 Although under most circumstances transmission of nociceptive information results in pain perception, many physicians and patients are unaware that nociception is dissociable from the experience of pain.",
              "In other words, nociception can occur in the absence of awareness of pain, and pain can occur in the absence of measurably noxious stimuli.",
              "This phenomenon is observable in instances of massive trauma (such as that which might be incurred by a motor vehicle accident) when victims exhibit a stoic painless state despite severe injury, and conversely, when individuals with functional pain syndromes report considerable anguish in spite of having no observable tissue damage.",
              "In contrast, perception of pain occurs when stimulation of nociceptors is intense enough to activate A\u03b4 fibers, resulting in a subjective experience of a sharp, prickling pain.",
              "4 As stimulus strength increases, C fibers are recruited, and the individual experiences an intense, burning pain that continues after the cessation of the stimulus.",
              "These types of experiences occur during the two phases of pain perception that occur following an acute injury.",
              "2 The first phase, which is not particularly intense, comes immediately after the painful stimulus and is known as fast pain.",
              "The second phase, known as slow pain, is more unpleasant, less discretely localized, and occurs after a longer delay.",
              "Activation of nociceptors is transduced along the axons of peripheral nerves which terminate in the dorsal horn of the spine.",
              "There, messages are relayed up the spinal cord and through the spinothalamic tract to output on the thalamus.",
              "In turn, the thalamus serves as the major \u201crelay station\u201d for sensory information to the cerebral cortex.",
              "5 Nociceptive pathways terminate in discrete subdivisions of thalamic nuclei known as the ventral posterior lateral nucleus and the ventromedial nucleus.",
              "6 From these nuclei, nociceptive information is relayed to various cortical and subcortical regions, including the amygdala, hypothalamus, periaqueductal grey, basal ganglia, and regions of cerebral cortex.",
              "Most notably, the insula and anterior cingulate cortex are consistently activated when nociceptors are stimulated by noxious stimuli, and activation in these brain regions is associated with the subjective experience of pain.",
              "7 In turn, these integrated thalamocortical and corticolimbic structures, which collectively have been termed the pain \u201cneuromatrix,\u201d process somatosensory input and output neural impulses which influence nociception and pain perception.",
              "8 Nociception is mediated by the function of numerous intra- and extra-cellular molecular messengers involved in signal transduction in the peripheral and central nervous systems. All nociceptors, when activated by the requisite mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimulus, transmit information via the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.",
              "9 In addition, inflammatory mediators are secreted at site of the original injury to stimulate nociceptor activation.",
              "This \u201cinflammatory soup\u201d is comprised of chemicals such as peptides (e.",
              "g., bradykinin), neurotransmitters (e.",
              "g., serotonin), lipids (e.",
              "g., prostaglandins), and neurotrophins (e.",
              "g., NGF).",
              "The presence of these molecules excites nociceptors or lowers their activation threshold, resulting in the transmission of afferent signals to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord as well as initiating neurogenic inflammation.",
              "3 Neurogenic inflammation is the process by which active nociceptors release neurotransmitters such as substance P from the peripheral terminal to induce vasodilation, leak proteins and fluids into the extracellular space near the terminal end of the nociceptor, and stimulate immune cells which contribute to the inflammatory soup.",
              "As a result of these neurochemical changes in the local environment of nociceptors, the activation of A\u03b4 and C fibers increases, and peripheral sensitization occurs.",
              "10 In turn, nociceptive signal transduction up the spinothalamic tract results in elevated release of norepinephrine from the locus coeruleus neurons projecting to thalamus, which in turn relays nociceptive information to somatosensory cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus.",
              "11,12 As such, norepinephrine modulates the \u201cgain\u201d of nociceptive information as it is relayed for processing in other cortical and subcortical brain regions.",
              "Concomitantly, opioid receptors in the peripheral and central nervous systems (e.",
              "g., those in neurons of the dorsal horn of the spine and the periaqueductal grey in the brain) result in inhibition of pain processing and analgesia when stimulated by opiates or endogenous opioids like endorphin, enkephalin, or dynorphin.",
              "13 The secretion of endogenous opioids is largely governed by the descending modulatory pain system.",
              "14 The neurotransmitter GABA is also involved in the central modulation of pain processing, by augmenting descending inhibition of spinal nociceptive neurons.",
              "15 A host of other neurochemicals are also involved in pain perception;",
              "the neurochemistry of nociception and central-peripheral pain modulation is extremely complex.",
              "The brain does not passively receive pain information from the body, but instead actively regulates sensory transmission by exerting influences on the spinal dorsal horn via descending projections from the medulla.",
              "16 In their seminal Gate Control theory of pain, Melzack and Wall proposed that the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn gates the perception of noxious stimuli by integrating upstream afferent signals from the peripheral nervous system with downstream modulation from the brain.",
              "17 Interneurons in the dorsal horn can inhibit and potentiate impulses ascending to higher brain centers, and thus they provide a site where the central nervous system controls impulse transmission into consciousness.",
              "The descending pain modulatory system exerts influences on nociceptive input from the spinal cord.",
              "This network of cortical, subcortical, and brainstem structures includes prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, hypothalamus, periaqueductal grey, rostral ventromedial medulla, and dorsolateral pons/tegmentum.",
              "7 The coordinated activity of these brain structures modulates nociceptive signals via descending projections to the spinal dorsal horn.",
              "By virtue of the somatotopic organization of these descending connections, the central nervous system can selectively control signal transmission from specific parts of the body.",
              "The descending pain modulatory system has both anti- and pro-nociceptive effects.",
              "Classically, the descending pain modulatory system has been construed as the means by which the central nervous system inhibits nociceptive signals at the spinal outputs.",
              "16 In a crucial early demonstration, Reynolds observed that direct electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal grey could produce dramatic analgesic effects as evidenced by the ability to undergo major surgery without pain.",
              "18 Yet, this brain system can also facilitate nociception.",
              "For instance, projections from the periaqueductal grey to the rostral ventromedial medulla have been shown to enhance spinal transmission of nociceptive information from peripheral nociceptors.",
              "19 Central modulation of pain may have been a conserved across human evolution due to its potentially adaptive effects on survival.",
              "For instance, in situations of serious mortal threat (for example, in the face of war and civil accidents, or more primordially, when being attacked by a vicious animal), suppression of pain might enable a severely-injured individual to continue intense physical activity such as fleeing from danger or fighting a deadly opponent.",
              "Yet, the neurobiological linkages between the brain, the spinothalamic tract, the dorsal horn, and the peripheral nerves also provide a physiological pathway by which negative emotions and stress can amplify and prolong pain, causing functional interference and considerable suffering.",

              "21 Thus, attended stimuli receive preferential information processing and are likely to govern behavior.",
              "In this sense, attention allows for the evaluation of salient stimuli, and facilitates execution of approach behaviors in response to appetitive stimuli or avoidance behaviors in response to aversive ones.",
              "Thus, depending on its salience to the survival of the organism, the object of attention elicits the motivation to approach or avoid, while the resultant emotional state, as the manifestation of approach or avoidance motivations, tunes and directs attention.",
              "22,23 By virtue of its significance for health and well-being, pain automatically and involuntarily attracts attention.",

              "28 In contrast, attentional hypervigilance for pain, a high degree of monitoring internal and external stimuli that is often observed among persons with chronic pain,29 amplifies pain intensity and is associated with the interpretation of harmless sensations (like moderate levels of pressure) as painfully unpleasant.",
              "30,31 Pain involves a process of cognitive appraisal, whereby the individual consciously or unconsciously evaluates the meaning of sensory signals emanating from the body to determine the extent to which they signify the presence of an actual or potential harm.",

              "change in pain intensity results in altered activation of somatosensory cortex, whereas change in pain unpleasantness results in altered activation of the anterior cingulate cortex.",
              "32,33 Thus, a sensory signal originating from the muscles of lower back might be perceived as a warmth and tightness, or viewed as a terrible agony, in spite of the stimulus intensity being held constant.",
              "The manner in which the bodily sensation is appraised may in turn influence whether it is experienced as unpleasant pain or not.",
              "34 The extent to which a given bodily sensation is interpreted as threatening is in part dependent on whether or not the individual believes he or she is able to cope with that sensation.",
              "If, during this complex cognitive process of appraisal, available coping resources are deemed sufficient to deal with the sensation, then pain can be perceived as controllable.",
              "Pain intensity is reduced when pain is perceived to be controllable, whether or not the individual acts to control the pain.",
              "Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation is positively associated with the extent to which pain is viewed as controllable and negatively correlated with subjective pain intensity.",
              "This brain region is implicated in emotion regulation efforts, such as when threatening stimuli are reappraised to be benign.",

              "40 The aversive nature of pain elicits a powerful emotional reaction that feeds back to modulate pain perception.",
              "Pain often results in feelings of anger, sadness, and fear depending on the how the pain is cognitively appraised.",
              "For instance, the belief \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that I have to live with this pain\u201d is likely to lead to anger, whereas the belief \u201cMy life is hopeless now that I have this pain\u201d will likely result in sadness.",
              "Fear is a common reaction to pain when individuals interpret the sensations from the body as indicating the presence of serious threat.",
              "These emotions are coupled with autonomic, endocrine, and immune responses which may amplify pain through a number of psychophysiological pathways.",
              "For example, pain induction significantly elevates sympathetic nervous system activity, marked by increased anxiety, heart rate, and galvanic skin response.",
              "41 Furthermore, negative emotions and stress increase contraction of muscle tissue;",
              "elevated electromyographic activity occurs in the muscles of the back and neck under conditions of stress and negative affect and is perceived as painful spasms.42,43 This sympathoexcitatory reaction coupled with emotions like anger and fear may reflect an evolutionarily conserved, active coping response to escape the painful stimulus.",
              "Yet negative emotional states intensify pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and pain-induced cardiovascular autonomic responses, while reducing the sense of perceived control over pain.",
              "44 Stress and negative emotions like anger and fear may temporarily dampen pain via norepinephrine release, but when the sympathetic \u201cfight or flight\u201d response is prolonged it can increase blood flow to the muscle and increase muscle tension which may aggravate the original injury.",
              "45 Alternatively, pain inputs from the viscera and muscles may stimulate cardiac vagal premotor neurons, leading to hypotension, bradycardia, and hyporeactivity to the environment \u2013 a pattern of autonomic response that corresponds with passive pain coping and depressed affect.",
              "46 In addition to autonomic reactivity, pro-inflammatory cytokines and the stress hormone cortisol are released during the experience of negative emotion;",
              "these bio-molecular factors enhance nociception, facilitate processing of aversive information in the brain, and when their release is chronic or recurrent, may cause or exacerbate tissue damage.",
              "8,47,48 Moreover, negative emotions are associated with increased activation in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and anterior insula \u2013 these brain structures not only mediate the processing of emotions, but are also important nodes of the pain neuromatrix that tune attention toward pain, intensify pain unpleasantness, and amplify interoception (the sense of the physical condition of the body).",
              "49,50 Thus, when individuals experience negative emotions like anger or fear as a result of pain or other emotionally salient stimuli, the heightened neural processing of threat in affective brain circuits primes the subsequent perception of pain51,52 and increases the likelihood that sensations from within the body will be interpreted as painful.",
              "53\u201355 The fear of pain, a clinical feature of chronic pain patients, is associated with hypervigilance for and sustained attention to pain-related stimuli.",
              "56 Thus, negative emotions bias attention toward pain, which then increase its unpleasantness.",
              "In addition, negative emotions and stress impair prefrontal cortex function, which may reduce the ability to regulate pain using higher order cognitive strategies like reappraisal or viewing the pain as controllable and surmountable.",
              "57,58 Thus, anger, sadness, and fear may result from acute or chronic pain and in turn feedback into the bio-behavioral processes that influence pain perception to exacerbate anguish and suffering.",
              "Pain is not only a sensory, cognitive, and emotional experience, but also involves behavioral reactions that may alleviate, exacerbate, or prolong pain experience.",
              "Typical pain behaviors in low back pain include grimacing, rubbing, bracing, guarded movement, and sighing.",
              "59 These behaviors facilitate the communication of pain and exert social influences that may have vicarious gain for the individual suffering from pain;",
              "such benefits include sympathy, acts of kindness and generosity, tolerance, lowered expectations, and social bonding, among others.",
              "60 In addition, guarding or avoidance of activities associated with pain may be negatively reinforcing by virtue of the temporary alleviation of pain experience.",
              "61 The fact that these avoidant behaviors decrease the occurrence of pain results in increasing use of avoidance as a coping strategy.",
              "Yet, greater use of avoidance as a result of fear of pain predicts higher levels of functional disability.",
              "62 It is not merely that persons with greater pain-related disability engage in more avoidant behaviors, but rather studies indicate that avoidant behavior and beliefs are a precursor to disability.",
              "63\u201365 Avoidance contributes to negative clinical outcomes in patients with chronic low back pain.",
              "Fear-avoidance of pain influences physical impairment and is more strongly associated with functional disability than pain severity.",
              "66\u201368 In contrast, progressive increase in activity through exercise has been shown to result in significant benefits in pain, disability, physical impairment, and psychological distress for low back pain patients.",
              "69 In light of the robust relation between coping behaviors and pain, behavioral and psychosocial interventions hold great promise in reducing pain intensity and pain-related functional disability in chronic pain conditions such as low back pain.",
              "70 The foregoing review attests to the multidimensionality of pain.",

              "In this regard, identification of the physical pathology at the site of injury is necessary but not sufficient to explicate the complex process by which somatosensory information is transformed into the physiological, cognitive, affective, and behavioral response labeled as pain.",
              "Indeed, in the case of chronic low back pain, the magnitude of tissue damage may be out of proportion to the reported pain experience, there may be no remaining structural impairment, and physical signs that have a predominantly nonorganic basis are likely to be present.",

              "In fact, the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (ARA) exerts pro-inflammatory and atherogenic actions via its conversion by the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipooxygenase (LOX) enzymatic pathways to bioactive mediators known as eicosanoids (prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes (TXs) and leukotrienes (LTs).",
              "However, during the initial (acute) phase of an inflammatory response, the ARA metabolism can also switch to the production of lipoxins (LXs), another eicosanoid class with the capacity to limit the extent and duration of the inflammatory process and promote the resolution of inflammation [4].",
              "LXs are considered the first identified members of the family of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) [4, 5].",
              "The SPMs family also comprises n-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived pro-resolving mediators called resolvins (Rvs) and protectins (PDs) [6].",
              "In the brain, the bioavailability of PUFAs and of their bioactive derivatives strongly depends on diet composition with an ideal ratio of 5 (n-6): 1 (n-3) [7].",

              "Several studies have contributed to reveal that OEA binds with high affinity the subtype alpha of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR-alpha) producing satiety responses that are not observed in mice lacking PPAR-alpha [97].",
              "Interestingly, it has been reported that OEA can also evoke the secretion of GLP-1 and produce anorexic effects by engaging the G protein-coupled receptor 119 (GPR119) [100].",
              "The mode of action of OEA illustrates a case of lipid-derived sensor of dietary fats connecting food intake and fatty acids sensing in the gut to hypothalamic fatty acids sensing.",
              "Although controversial as for the subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation [101], OEA-induced hypophagia is abolished in case vagal sensory afferents are lost as for pharmacological treatment or surgical resection [97, 102].",
              "Next, intraperitoneal OEA administration increases transcription of the early gene c-Fos in the NST [102], and protein expression in oxytocin-immuno-reactive neurons in hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) and in the histaminergic tuberomammillary nucleus [103].",
              "Thus, at least two neurotransmitter systems appear involved in the brain control of OEA-induced anorexigenic effects.",
              "First, PVN and SON activation increases oxytocin mRNA levels and neurosecretion whereas blockade of oxytocin receptors suppresses OEA-induced hypophagia [103, 104].",
              "Secondly, the hypophagic effects of OEA are abolished in case brain histaminergic system is not fully functional and the integrity of histamine transmission is also required for the OEA-dependent increase of c-Fos expression in oxytocin neurons of the PVN [103].",
              "This is the first demonstration that an intestinal lipid formed upon dietary fats ingestion generates a satiety signal that is decoded by the brain histaminergic system [103].",
              "In spite of its selectivity, this mechanism may contribute to explain several physiological pathways linking intestinal fat sensing to brain circuits involved in energy intake but also in reward assignment to palatable food.",
              "Indeed, OEA activity can also help to disclose some mechanisms underlying the obesogenic effects triggered by the overconsumption of palatable energy-dense food, linking fat sensing within the gut-brain axis to homeostatic and hedonic processing of food intake.",
              "Prolonged intake of high fat food reduces the intestinal levels of NAEs [105] and also deregulates the nigrostriatal DA release evoked by intragastric lipid infusion [106].",
              "Remarkably, intestinal OEA infusion can revert and normalize DA signaling, and exogenous OEA infusion also appears to reestablish the OEA-mediated anorexigenic effects but only in mice fed with a low-fat diet [106] that increased the intake of a lipid emulsion in parallel with the increase of striatal DA signaling of rewarding food.",
              "The link between the homeostatic control of energy intake and brain reward circuits is demonstrated by the increased intake of a non-palatable low fat emulsion following OEA administration in HFD-fed animals.",
              "Thus, prolonged intake of HFD may lead to overconsumption of dietary fats because of the lower intestinal OEA levels and reduced brain DA signaling.",
              "OEA links fatty acids sensing in the gut to central processing of hedonic hunger and its ability to affect brain DA signaling might contribute to reassign a reward value to foods normally considered as non-palatable or barely hedonic.",
              "In this view, OEA is a member of a family of lipids that is worth investigating for a better understanding of the lipid-sensing gut-brain pathways and detection of effective drug targets for the treatment of obesity and eating disorders.",
              "The survival and perpetuation of species are preserved through reproduction.",
              "This process requires adequate energy resources, likewise indispensable to support the biosynthesis of sex steroids, the production of high quality gametes, pregnancy and lactation in mammals.",

              "In this sense, puberty onset, fertility rate and successful pregnancy all depend on diet and energy homeostasis, as excellently reviewed elsewhere [107].",
              "Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the increase of metabolic disorders matches with increased rates of infertility in developed and developing countries, as a consequence of environmental factors such as over-nutrition and sedentary lifestyle [108].",
              "Furthermore, nutritional status of parents may impact gamete epigenome with effects on metabolic and reproductive health of the offspring [109].",
              "As described in the previous paragraph, several metabolic sensors from adipose tissues and gut sense the availability or the lack of nutritional resources and, via specific receptors located in peripheral tissues or in the brain, exert local activities on gonads or integrate the gut-brain communication to the HPG axis (Fig.",

              "A complicated network of neuronal circuits supervises reproductive functions, attempting to coordinate and converge towards the HPG axis environmental, hormonal and metabolic conditions (Table \u200b11).",
              "A hierarchical actor in HPG axis is the decapeptide Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH), with its well-known role in the stimulation of pituitary gonadotropins and downstream of gonadal functions [140-144].",
              "Due to their excellent position in the hypothalamus, GnRH neurons are the best candidate to relay metabolic information to the HPG axis, thus they start a dynamic interplay with the wide range of the signals involved in the metabolic control of reproduction [145, 146].",
              "Peripherally and centrally produced metabolic sensors that link metabolism and reproduction.",
              "The relationship between metabolism and reproduction is centrally orchestrated by orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides produced in the ARC [147] (Table \u200b11).",
              "First class includes peptides able to stimulate the appetite, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti related protein (AgRP), melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH);",
              "the second one includes appetite inhibiting neuropeptides such as proopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor and cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript (CART) [116].",
              "Strong evidence confers important roles in reproduction to these metabolic neuropeptides, through their ability to directly contact GnRH neurons [148-152], thus influencing gonadotropin discharge [108].",
              "One of the major peripheral indicators of body metabolic reserves is leptin, a peptide hormone produced by white adipose tissue [123].",
              "Leptin is an essential threshold factor in the control of puberty onset by food intake [118] and such an action has GnRH neurons as potential targets.",
              "Many data demonstrate that GnRH neurons are devoid of functional leptin receptors, thus intermediate neuronal pathways convey HPG nutritional cues [153].",
              "In such a context, kisspeptins - kiss1 gene produced peptides [154] - have an important role through the activation of kisspeptin receptor GPR54 [155].",
              "In fact, the kisspeptin system has a prominent role in the central and local regulation of reproduction as upstream modulators of GnRH [144, 156-160].",
              "Kisspeptin system deeply responds to gonadal and metabolic factors [161-163], including leptin.",

              "Reduced expression of kiss1 in the ARC, but not in the AVPV, causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in this animal model [124].",
              "However, indirect action of leptin through other hypothalamic neurons in tight connection with kisspeptin neurons cannot be ruled-out [165, 166].",
              "In fact, the selective ablation of leptin receptor from hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons does not alter puberty onset [167].",
              "Consistently, functional crosstalk between kisspeptin neurons NPY and POMC has also been unraveled [133, 168].",
              "Diet can affect reproduction through the inhibition of kisspeptin signaling in diabetes mellitus affected rats as well as diet-induced obese (DIO) male rats [169, 170].",
              "Fasting also reduces kiss1 mRNA expression in the prepubertal rat [164] and adult mice [168] hypothalamus.",

              "Ghrelin is a peptide secreted by the gastrointestinal tract, working as an orexigenic factor [115];",
              "in volunteers, intravenous ghrelin infusion increases appetite and food intake by 28% [174].",
              "Plasma levels of ghrelin rise almost 2-fold immediately due to fasting and fall after the ingestion of food [175].",
              "However, the exact molecular mechanism by which this hormone regulates feeding is poorly understood.",
              "As far as the activity on the HPG axis is concerned, ghrelin has an inhibitory effect on both Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) release.",
              "This effect is due to the inhibition of hypothalamic GnRH neurons and direct suppressive effects on gonads [176].",
              "In animal models, ghrelin has the ability to delay puberty onset in response to insufficient energy states, via the modulation of kiss1 expression [115, 117, 177].",

              "Interestingly, during the 20th century, Western diet has been subjected to deep changes, with an enrichment in n-6, over n-3 PUFA assumption, thus contributing to the onset of overweight and obesity [182, 183].",
              "Diet is an important source of ARA (further details in parapraph 4) and thus, in addition to enzymatic hydrolysis, it is realistic that the tone of eCBs might be modulated by the fatty acid composition of food [184], with different outcomes on health including the centrally orchestrated control of reproduction.",
              "ECBs work as orexigenic factors, stimulating food intake and promoting the accumulation of body fat [13, 185-188].",
              "Elevated circulating AEA and 2-AG levels and a parallel drop in the FAAH activity in obese subjects corroborate the role of the eCB system in human obesity [189].",
              "Accordingly, the activation of CB1 increases food intake [190], while its genetic and pharmacological impairment implicates less food assumption [191, 192].",
              "The reintroduction of n-3 PUFA in the Western diet, and so of EPA and DHA, may help to restore eCB tone [193, 194], since experimental data suggest that a dietary treatment with n-3 PUFA decreases the concentration of AEA and 2-AG in the visceral adipose tissue and AEA levels in the liver and heart [195].",
              "Therefore, CB1 seems to cooperate with key hypothalamic peptides involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis, like POMC/CART neurons into ARC [131].",
              "In this regard, the orexigenic effect of AEA may be centrally mediated by inactivation of CART immunoreactive fibers [196].",
              "This crosstalk seems to be well demonstrated in male mice chronically exposed to Bisphenol A (BPA) via drinking water [197].",
              "In these animals, BPA works as a powerful anorexigenic signal, depressing cannabinoid signalling and upregulating the hypothalamic expression of CART [197].",
              "However, some evidence support the hypothesis that the regulation of food intake by eCBs within the hypothalamus might be more complex with a bimodal orexigenic and anorexigenic action, depending on whether CB1 is activated in glutamatergic or GABAergic terminals, respectively [198].",
              "A strong interaction has also been suggested between eCB system and leptin, the latter producing its anorexigenic effects through the inhibition of hypothalamic eCB levels [199];",
              "accordingly, in Ob/Ob mice, there is an overactivation of the hypothalamic eCB signalling [199].",
              "Similarly, a functional synergic overlap in promoting food intake has been demonstrated between ghrelin and eCBs, at both central and peripheral levels [200].",
              "Ghrelin positively regulates the tone of eCBs and hypothalamic 2-AG levels increase after food deprivation and decrease after food consumption in parallel to ghrelin [201].",
              "Thus, both leptin and ghrelin require a functional CB1 signalling to exert their respective anorexigenic and orexigenic effects, since in the hypothalamus of CB1 knockout mice, these effects are abolished [202].",
              "An eCB system has been detected in GnRH secreting neurons, in hypothalamic cell lines, both in in vitro and in in vivo models and either in mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates [203-205].",
              "AEA can modulate GnRH biosynthesis, release or signaling via CB1 both centrally and peripherally [14, 17, 18, 204, 206-210].",
              "Outcomes on steroid biosynthesis, gametogenesis, gamete quality and fertility rate have been reported [16-18, 142, 211, 212, 213].",
              "Consistently, the characterization of the reproductive phenotype in CB1 knockout mice revealed impairment of HPG axis at multiple levels [214, 215].",
              "At molecular levels, several mechanisms have been reported.",
              "Classically, eCBs act as retrograde signals to reduce GABAergic synaptic transmission to GnRH secreting neurons, but involvement of glial cells and the direct activity on subsets of GnRH secreting neurons that express CB1 have been reported [17, 18].",
              "Lastly, updates in the modulation of GnRH via eCBs recently come from a non-mammalian vertebrate model, the anuran amphibian Pelophylax esculentus and address kisspeptin secreting neurons as a new target for eCBs in the modulation of HPG axis [207, 210].",
              "Interestingly, in male rats exposed to immobilization stress, kiss1 mRNA decreases in the medial preoptic area rather than in the ARC and serum LH concentrations reduce as a consequence of the HPG axis suppression [216].",
              "Thus, despite the fact that the involvement of eCBs in the functional interplay between kisspeptin and GnRH-secreting neurons in physiological conditions has never been investigated so far in mammals, data in amphians deserve attention since most master regulatory systems are evolutionarily conserved [143].",
              "The main n-6 and n-3 LC PUFAs found in the brain are the ARA (20:4 n-6) and DHA (22:6 n-3) respectively.",
              "Both these LC PUFAs have pivotal roles in brain physiology as they regulate fundamental neurobiological processes, in particular those involved in cognition [8, 217].",
              "Neuroprotective activities of LC n-3 PUFAs DHA and EPA are believed to be potent for protection and/or treatment of cognitive decline and dementia [218-223].",

              "In the brain, LC-PUFAs are largely esterified to the phospholipid cell membrane of neurons and glial cells (astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes).",
              "ARA represents 5 to 11% of total brain phospholipids while DHA represents 13 to 22% [228].",
              "Brain phospholipids enriched with DHA are especially present in grey matter and synapses.",
              "Due to the limited capacity of the brain to synthesize LC PUFAs [229, 230], they have to be provided through the diet either as precursors [n-6 linoleic acid (LA) and n-3 \u03b1linolenic acid (ALA) found in vegetable oils and grain products] or as preformed ARA and DHA (found in meat products and fish, respectively) [231, 232].",
              "Hence, increased consumption of n-3 PUFAs rich products results in a partial replacement of ARA by DHA in brain cell membrane [228].",
              "Conversely, a lower n-3 PUFAs intake leads to lower brain levels of DHA with increased ARA levels.",
              "LA and ALA are metabolized into ARA and DHA through a series of elongation and desaturation steps.",
              "The fatty acid desaturase (\u0394D, gene FADS) \u03945D and \u03946D are rate-limiting enzymes.",
              "In humans, carriers of specific genetic variants of FADS display higher biological status of LA and ALA (PUFAs precursors) and lower status of LC-PUFA products, ARA and DHA [233].",
              "Of note, observational studies in humans revealed a gender difference in PUFAs levels, with higher ARA and DHA reported in women as compared to men [233, 234].",
              "These differences could be linked to sex hormones as they influence PUFAs metabolism with estrogen stimulating, and testosterone inhibiting the conversion of both n-3 and n-6 precursors into their respective long chain metabolites [235].",
              "However, whether these differences in PUFAs have a role in specific brain diseases with a gender component has been poorly questioned and requires further investigations.",
              "As the endogenous synthesis of DHA from ALA is extremely inefficient, the consumption of preformed DHA from fish sources is recommended.",
              "DHA is likely to enter in the brain from the blood, but the mechanisms involved are still a matter of debate [8, 236].",
              "While numerous data show that non-esterified DHA freely enters the brain [8], an orphan receptor, the major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2a (Mfsd2a) has been described as important to transport DHA in the form of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) through the blood brain barrier (BBB) [237].",
              "In retinal cells, adiponectin receptor 1 has been recently identified as a key factor for DHA uptake and retention [238].",
              "DHA, ARA and their mediators regulate several processes within the brain, such as neurotransmission and neuroinflammation, which are key processes in cognition [8, 216, 239].",

              "It is now well accepted that in the healthy brain, these cells modulate synaptic functions, in particular through the phagocytosis of unnecessary synapses [244] and protect neurons from infection or damage [245, 246].",
              "Indeed, microglia deregulation due to aging or neurodegenerative processes participates to synaptic loss observed not only in Alzheimer\u2019s disease [247] but also in chronic stress conditions [248] or dietary lipid unbalance [249, 250].",
              "In addition, aging and neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by increased proinflammatory factors such as cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which participate to neuronal death, neuropathological processes and promote cognitive deficit [23, 251].",

              "Interestingly, several studies report that blocking COX1/2 with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) protects against cognitive impairments in animal model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease suggesting a role for PGE2 and COX2 in memory impairment [254].",
              "This is consistent with the observation that in normal population, NSAIDs assumption prevents Alzheimer\u2019s disease [255].",
              "Such a protective effect of COX inhibition relies on the prevention of neuroinflammatory processes and the promotion of adequate microglia activity.",

              "The use of KDs in adults is limited due to poor compliance to the treatment, but recent studies suggest that KDs can be effective in adults as well [306, 307].",

              "After understanding metabolic pathways in modern era, the attention was focused on the ketogenic effects of fasting, so a ketogenic diet was proposed for the treatment of epilepsy since 1921 [308, 309].",
              "The mechanism for such anti-epileptic effect is actually unknown.",
              "Because one of the most evident metabolic effects of KDs is the elevation in blood levels of ketone bodies, many studies have searched for possible anti-epileptic effects of ketone bodies [303], but the results of these studies fail to ultimately confirm that this is the main mechanism of action of KDs.",
              "Simple clinical observations, for example, give somewhat strange data.",
              "In fact, while the elevation of blood ketones can be simply obtained by fasting for 12-24 hours, an effective anti-epileptic effect is only observed several weeks after the initiation of a KD.",
              "This observation suggests that ketone bodies should not have a direct, clinically relevant, anti-epileptic effect.",
              "On the other hand, the acute assumption of a small amount of sugar is able to abruptly abolish the anti-epileptic effect of KDs, with even possible immediate induction of seizures [310].",
              "This would suggest an important role for low glicaemia or high blood ketones.",
              "In rat models, some studies have shown that ketone bodies can have acute anti-seizure effects [311, 312] and that an acute administration of a synthetic ketone ester can have a small anti-seizure effect [313].",
              "In vitro studies have also suggested that acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate can decrease the activity of neurons within the substantia nigra, which is an important center for the propagation of seizures [314] and that acetoacetate inhibits vesicular glutamate transporters [315].",
              "However, it has not been proven that a prolonged administration of a synthetic ketone precursor produces a significant anti-epileptic effect.",
              "Actually, calorie restriction is believed to have an important role for the effects of KDs [316, 317].",
              "In fact, even fasting is known to have anti-epileptic effects since the beginning of the 20th century [309].",
              "It has been argued that the energy metabolism could be involved in the anticonvulsant mechanism of KDs [318] and that some of the biochemical effects induced and maintained by KDs could have anti-seizure properties.",
              "The biochemical pathways evaluated until now include ketone bodies production, GABA and glutamate synthesis and recycling, adenosine production, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle refueling and fatty acids oxidation [319].",
              "It is supposed that such metabolic effects act on brain neurotransmitter production or on ion channel functioning [320] and that the substantia nigra could be particularly involved in these effects [314, 321].",
              "Surprisingly, despite KD is a high-fat diet, few studies have assessed the effects of KD on lipid levels or proportion within the central nervous system.",
              "Two recent studies reported an increase in the content of unsaturated fatty acids within the hippocampus [322, 323], but this topic certainly deserves to be further investigated.",
              "Taken together the above data indicate that blood levels of ketone bodies have not a direct, clinically relevant, anti-epileptic effect, but they should be considered an index of the compliance of patients to the diet regimen.",
              "Interestingly, KDs have been proposed to treat many other neurological diseases, like brain trauma, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, mitochondriopathies, alternating hemiplegia of childhood, brain tumors, migraine and autism spectrum disorders [324, 325].",
              "Again, the mechanism for the beneficial effects of KDs in these pathologies is unknown, but it is supposed to involve an amelioration of the metabolic pathways for energy utilization in the cells of the nervous system.",
              "KDs also have other interesting therapeutic effects.",
              "In fact, it has been acknowledged that KDs produce weight loss and ameliorate glycaemic control and blood lipid profile in metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [324].",
              "These effects are probably due to the low carbohydrate intake which obviously ameliorates the glycaemic control and promotes lipid catabolism.",
              "There are also some studies reporting possible beneficial effects of KDs on tumor progression [326, 327].",
              "It can be argued that such effects could be ascribed to the restricted availability of nutrients from the diet, particularly aminoacids, which are obviously a limiting factor for cellular growth and, thus, for tumor growth.",
              "Another possibility is that KDs could enhance the oxidative stress in cancer cells resulting in a greater vulnerability of these cells to radiation therapies [328].",
              "KDs can have transient adverse effects, like gastrointestinal distress, acidosis, hypoglycaemia, dehydration, hyperlipidaemia, and lethargy.",
              "Long treatment with KDs is a risk for vitamin and mineral deficiency which can produce easy bruising, impairment of growth and bone fractures.",
              "Hyperuricaemia and kidney stones have also been described [329, 330].",
              "KDs are generally considered safe treatments and most of the side effects can be prevented or treated.",
              "One of the greatest problems with KDs is the poor palatability and the difficulty for patients to follow severe dietary restrictions.",
              "This is why some less restrictive kinds of KDs are currently proposed to patients [305].",
              "However, the greatest challenge for present research is to understand the true mechanisms of KDs and to find a pharmacological alternative, thus realizing a sort of \u201cKD in a pill\u201d, with the same or greater efficacy of a KD but without its dietary limitations [331];",
              "to this aim, the anti-seizure efficacy of a synthetic ketone was tested in animal models and some acute effects have been described [313, 317, 332], but much work is still needed to find an effective drug substitute for KDs.",
              "Due to the above observation, we can conclude that dietary fats are both friends and foes for brain functions.",

              "As a consequence, the manipulation of lifestyle factors, such as dietary interventions is a recognized approach to maintain and preserve brain health along lifespan.",

              "Previous studies also reported that RC enhanced oxidative stress and proinflammatory effects on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells [26], which might damage the blood\u2012brain barrier, subsequently altering amyloid degradation and cholesterol homeostasis [27] in the brain.",
              "A recent Mendelian randomization study on the risk factors for AD found that genetically elevated TC and LDL-C levels increased neurotic plaque burden, but the effects were driven by single nucleotide polymorphisms of APOE [28], whose genetic product is known to be the key ligand for remnant lipoprotein clearance by the liver.",

              "Based on previous studies and the relationship between RC levels and the CERAD total score found in the present study, it is supposed that TC, in combination with RC, might be a better bioindex for the prediction of cognitive function than TC or RC separately.",
              "In light of this, the present study examined and demonstrated that a higher TC/RC ratio is suggestive of better verbal learning and memory function assessed by CERAD tests.",
              "In addition, the present study found that the TC/RC ratio showed a significant positive association not only with the CERAD total score but also with the CERAD delayed trial test score [see Additional file 1, Table S1], while RC levels showed no association with delayed trial test score [see Additional file 1, Table S2].",
              "Previous studies have found that some of the measures in the CERAD WL subtest, particularly delayed recall of a word list, could more efficiently distinguish persons with dementia from those with normal cognition [30].",
              "Therefore, the results of the present study indicated that the TC/RC ratio might have better value for predicting verbal learning and memory function than RC levels.",
              "Conclusively, the current study examined two available blood lipid indices for the assessment of verbal learning and memory function, which have not been reported by previous studies.",
              "For future clinical application, the present study provided evidence for the utilization of RC levels and the TC/RC ratio in the evaluation of verbal learning and memory function, which might assist in risk stratification for cognitive function impairment or AD susceptibility in elderly individuals.",

              "Additionally, the study proposed an RC derivative, the TC/RC ratio, and found its positive association with verbal learning and memory function, which had not been mentioned previously.",
              "Additionally, the results were estimated in several subpopulations, verifying its authenticity.",
              "The study has several limitations.",
              "First, this was an observational study with a cross-sectional design, and the causal relationship could not be determined between RC levels or the TC/RC ratio and cognitive function.",
              "Second, in this study, LDL-C was calculated based on the Friedewald equation, which is not applicable when TG levels > 400 mg/dl.",
              "Therefore, the results of the study should not be interpreted in the situation of very high TG levels.",
              "Third, the present study used calculated fasting RC to represent the \u201cremnant\u201d cholesterol level;",
              "however, this calculated fasting RC includes not only cholesterol from remnants but also cholesterol from newly formed VLDL particles, which in fact overestimates the cholesterol levels of actual remnants.",
              "However, RC from the indirect formula has been widely used in numerous clinical studies and has been proven to be a convenient and reliable risk predictor.",
              "Finally, although the present study included many important potential covariates previously reported to affect cognition in the statistical models, the possibility that residual confounding factors remain could not be ruled out.",
              "Future large-scale, prespecified trials are needed to further explore this subject.",
              "Utilizing a cohort of American elderly individuals aged over 60 years from the NHANES database, the present study found that in the context of a TG level below 400 mg/dl, a lower RC level and a higher TC/RC ratio were associated with better verbal learning and memory function.",

              "The findings, recently detailed in eLife, are significant not only for what they say about storage space but more importantly because they nudge us toward a better understanding of how, exactly, information is encoded in our brains.",
              "The question of just how much information our brains can hold is a longstanding one.",
              "We know that the human brain is made up of about 100 billion neurons, and that each one makes 1,000 or more connections to other neurons, adding up to some 100 trillion in total.",
              "We also know that the strengths of these connections, or synapses, are regulated by experience.",
              "When two neurons on either side of a synapse are active simultaneously, that synapse becomes more robust;",
              "the dendritic spine (the antenna on the receiving neuron) also becomes larger to support the increased signal strength.",
              "These changes in strength and size are believed to be the molecular correlates of memory.",
              "The different antenna sizes are often compared with bits of computer code, only instead of 1s and 0s they can assume a range of values.",
              "Until last week scientists had no idea how many values, exactly.",
              "Based on crude measurements, they had identified just three: small, medium and large.",
              "But a curious observation led the Salk team to refine those measurements.",
              "In the course of reconstructing a rat hippocampus, an area of the mammalian brain involved in memory storage, they noticed some neurons would form two connections with each other: the axon (or sending cable) of one neuron would connect with two dendritic spines (or receiving antennas) on the same neighboring neuron, suggesting that duplicate messages were being passed from sender to receiver.",
              "Because both dendrites were receiving identical information, the researchers suspected they would be similar in size and strength.",
              "But they also realized that if there were significant differences between the two, it could point to a whole new layer of complexity.",
              "If the spines were of a different shape or size, they reasoned, the message they passed along would also be slightly different, even if that message was coming from the same axon.",
              "So they decided to measure the synapse pairs.",
              "And sure enough, they found an 8 percent size difference between dendritic spines connected to the same axon of a signaling neuron.",
              "That difference might seem small, but when they plugged the value into their algorithms, they calculated a total of 26 unique synapse sizes.",
              "A greater number of synapse sizes means more capacity for storing information, which in this case translated into a 10-fold greater storage capacity in the hippocampus as a whole than the previous three-size model had indicated.",
              "\u201cIt\u2019s an order of magnitude more capacity than we knew was there,\u201d says Tom Bartol, a staff scientist at the Salk Institute and the study\u2019s lead author.",
              "But if our memory capacity is so great, why do we forget things?",
              "Because capacity is not really the issue, says Paul Reber, a memory researcher at Northwestern University who was not involved in the study, \u201cAny analysis of the number of neurons will lead to a sense of the tremendous capacity of the human brain.",
              "But it doesn\u2019t matter because our storage process is slower than our experience of the world.",
              "Imagine an iPod with infinite storage capacity.",
              "Even if you can store every song ever written, you still have to buy and upload all that music and then pull individual songs up when you want to play them.",
              "\u201d Reber says that it is almost impossible to quantify the amount of information in the human brain, in part because it consists of so much more information than we\u2019re consciously aware of: not only facts and faces and measurable skills but basic functions like how to speak and move and higher order ones like how to feel and express emotions.",

              "In some cases, a single axon from one neuron formed two synapses reaching out to a single dendrite of a second neuron, signifying that the first neuron seemed to be sending a duplicate message to the receiving neuron.",

              "But Tom Bartol, a Salk staff scientist, had an idea: if they could measure the difference between two very similar synapses such as these, they might glean insight into synaptic sizes, which so far had only been classified in the field as small, medium and large.",

              "This was a curveball from nature,\u201d says Bartol.",
              "Because the memory capacity of neurons is dependent upon synapse size, this eight percent difference turned out to be a key number the team could then plug into their algorithmic models of the brain to measure how much information could potentially be stored in synaptic connections.",
              "It was known before that the range in sizes between the smallest and largest synapses was a factor of 60 and that most are small.",
              "But armed with the knowledge that synapses of all sizes could vary in increments as little as eight percent between sizes within a factor of 60, the team determined there could be about 26 categories of sizes of synapses, rather than just a few.",

              "The team used their new data and a statistical model to find out how many signals it would take a pair of synapses to get to that eight percent difference.",
              "The researchers calculated that for the smallest synapses, about 1,500 events cause a change in their size/ability (20 minutes) and for the largest synapses, only a couple hundred signaling events (1 to 2 minutes) cause a change.",

              "The scaffolding theory of aging and cognition (STAC)14 provides a theoretical model for the causes and consequences of age-related compensatory neural activity.",
              "STAC posits that cognitive function in older adults can be understood in terms of the magnitude of neural insults that the brain has sustained (both structural and functional) as well as the compensatory neural activities (\u201cscaffolding\u201d) that operate to maintain cognitive behavior.",
              "According to this model, scaffolding is conceptualized as the recruitment of additional circuitry that shores up declining brain function that has become noisy, inefficient, or both.",
              "The pervasive finding of increased prefrontal activation in older adults across many different cognitive tasks reflects the engagement of compensatory scaffolding.",
              "The scaffolding is a direct response to the neural insults of aging which include volumetric shrinkage of brain structures,15 white matter degradation,16 and amyloid deposition,17 as well as functional decline in neural activities associated with dedifferentiation of ventral visual cortex,18,19 poor modulation of default network activity,20 and declining activity in the hippocampus.",
              "21,22 Effective compensatory activation in response to this degradation mitigates age-related decline in cognition.",
              "Importantly, STAC also provides for the possibility that cognitive training or sustained engagement in a novel task or environment, as well as exercise, can enhance the development of compensatory scaffolding, so that the ability to increase scaffolding as a result of cognitive training confers protection on cognitive function.",
              "A related view that has emerged from the imaging literature is that of cognitive reserve.",
              "23 The cognitive reserve model suggests that there are specific experiences and behaviors that confer protection from age-related decline.",
              "Examples of behaviors that may create reserve include education, high literacy, engaging work, and maintenance of an active, engaged lifestyle in late adulthood.",
              "24,25 All of these experiences appear to delay progression towards Alzheimer's disease, although, without experimental studies, the causal component is unclear (eg, do people high in reserve stay in the workforce or does workforce participation create reserve?)",
              ".",
              "Stern26 distinguishes between neural reserve and neural compensation.",
              "Reserve is essentially an increased supply of neural resources created as a result of experiences, whereas neural compensation is the ability to draw more effectively and efficiently on networks.",
              "Although the findings in the literature are sparse, there is a range of evidence suggesting that the older brain has considerable plasticity.",
              "Probably the most compelling data comes from stroke patients who have sustained permanent damage to their brain in specific areas as a result of neural bleed or blood clot.",
              "Despite very significant damage that has led to loss of behavioral function, stroke patients show dramatic recovery with sustained therapy.",
              "27 This change in function can only be due to plastic changes in brain function, where new parts of the brain take over functions performed by areas that have been damaged.",
              "The plasticity evidenced in stroke patients is quite amazing, and indicates that the aging brain is very capable of neural reorganization.",
              "One important thing to note about stroke patients are that they undergo many hours of intense therapy to regain function, and that this training is in domains that greatly facilitate function in everyday life.",
              "Thus, the environment maintains and supports gains in improvement after stroke, as patients must have communication and mobility skills if they are to maintain independence in everyday life.",
              "It is also important to recognize that a part of the stroke patient's brain has literally shut down, and this extreme condition forces the brain to manifest any plasticity that is available to restore function, when it may not do so under normal conditions.",
              "Healthy adults, on the other hand, may not have the ability to consciously draw upon unused parts of the brain to enhance cognitive function.",
              "Much remains to be understood as to how much cognitive training or other cognitive interventions can enhance function, but it does seem clear, based on stroke patients, as well as data from animal studies,28 that the potential of brain reorganization does occur even in late adulthood.",
              "Nevertheless, the conditions under which healthy older brains reorganize in an adaptive matter to enhance cognitive function are poorly understood.",
              "In line with the notion that contextual press or demand is an important element of accessing and utilizing any neural plasticity that exists in the aging brain, is the concept of a sustained mismatch between a person's desired cognitive state or goal and the demands of the environment.",
              "29 It is only when an individual experiences substantial and sustained demands on their cognitive system that plasticity will manifest itself.",
              "An older adult who, for example, must learn a demanding new route to visit his or her grandchildren in a new city might need to draw maximally upon attentional, task-switching, and working memory resources to complete this demanding drive on a complex highway system in traffic.",
              "This initial task requires flexibility;",
              "that is, deployment of the existing supply of resources to perform the novel task at hand.",
              "Plasticity would be manifested if this trip was successful, and the older adult began driving to many new places and ultimately developed significantly enhanced driving skills over a sustained period.",
              "This sustained novel activity might result in neural reorganization or even growth of neural structures associated with way-finding (much like the famed London cab driver study30), in which case plasticity would be manifested.",
              "Finally, we note that many of the cognitive demands associated with a demanding new drive could be diminished by using a navigational system, in which case, neither flexibility nor plasticity would be required, as the environmental support provided by the navigational system would result in a match between existing abilities and task demands.",
              "In a similar vein, Park et al31 suggest that cognitive change can only occur when a task or environment consistently makes demands on core cognitive processes like speed, working memory, episodic memory, and reasoning.",
              "Finally, it is important to recognize that there can be substantial individual differences in what comprises a demanding task or a challenging environment, and Park et al31 explicitly note the importance of novelty in effecting change.",
              "An older adult who was an accountant might not find it very demanding to learn how to manage a stock portfolio, but would be very challenged by learning to play a musical instrument.",
              "Past experiences, expertise, and cognitive status will all play important roles in understanding tasks that provide optimal challenge to an individual and have the potential to effect change in neural structure or function.",
              "There is tremendous debate about what constitutes evidence for neural plasticity.",
              "Perhaps the most unambiguous evidence is when training increases the thickness or volume of neural structure.",
              "It has been demonstrated that sedentary older adults who engage in aerobic exercise can delay shrinkage in prefrontal cortex, an area maximally sensitive to age-related volumetric shrinkage.",
              "32 In terms of cognitive interventions, actual gains in neural volume relative to a control group were demonstrated by Boyke et al33 in the mid temporal regions, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, when older adults were trained to juggle for 90 days.",
              "These regions are associated with complex motor behaviors, so this finding was an important demonstration of plasticity in older adults.",
              "Importantly, however, the gains were not maintained after a 90-day period of non-juggling, providing important evidence that there are many constraints on plasticity, and that the familiar \u201cuse or lose it\u201d adage was disappointingly relevant in this particular study.",
              "Other evidence shows that older men who played a demanding spatial navigational game every other day for 4 months exhibited stability of hippocampal volume over a 4-month period, whereas control subjects declined.",
              "34 Additionally, these trained subjects showed an increase in structural integrity of the hippocampus which was maintained when training ceased.",
              "Overall, however, the evidence that one can improve volume of neural structures through training is relatively sparse.",
              "The limited data available suggest that gains that are realized from a sustained training program most likely need to be maintained with continued performance.",
              "An important question is whether continuous improvement and challenge on a task is required to maintain gains, or whether mere maintenance of a high level of improved but asymptotic performance would be sufficient to preserve gains.",
              "It seems likely that it will be important for individuals to enjoy the tasks they are performing over the very long term so that the behavior can be sustained and gains maintained.",
              "This may be the greatest challenge associated with training the aging human brain.",
              "From a clinical perspective, daily \u201cbrain training\u201d could become a boring and effortful task, such that gains realized might be offset by the negative consequences of performing a task that over time could become a dreaded obligation rather than a pleasurable and stimulating activity.",
              "A more common finding than volumetric increase is a change in neural activity with training.",
              "The change can be in the form of activation of new regions, or decreases or increases in neural activity in task related structures that were activated before the training.",
              "The neural differences between pretest and post-test can be quite hard to interpret, and may or may not reflect a fundamental change in brain function or organization.",
              "Noack et al35 argue that many changes in activation as a result of training reflect flexibility in deployment of resources due to strategy change rather than a manifestation of plasticity resulting in an increase in intrinsic neural or cognitive capacity.",
              "They argue that the rich knowledge base that accrues as we age provides an excellent mechanism for utilizing wisdom and knowledge to facilitate performance, rather than a true change in the neurocognitive system.",
              "They suggest that younger adults have more neural plasticity than old, and that the young are most likely to show an increase in intrinsic neural capacity with training, whereas the old are more likely to recognize gains due to flexibility in strategy use.",
              "The expectation behind training is that it will improve cognitive capacity and thus increase neural efficiency by decreasing the demands a task makes on the neural system.",
              "If this is the case, one might expect that training would decrease neural activation on the trained task.",
              "Such a finding was reported by Brehmer et al.",
              "36 They trained older adults on a working memory task for 5 weeks and found that subjects who trained on the most demanding tasks (adaptive training) showed a decrease in activation in frontal, parietal, and occipital regions, which the authors suggested reflected improved neural efficiency and decreased resource utilization as a result of training.",
              "On the other hand, there is a considerable body of literature suggesting that enhanced neural activity is facultative for old adults, so it is also easy to imagine findings where training enhances neural activation and behavioral function in older adults.",
              "In line with this hypothesis, Nyberg et al7 reported that mnemonic training in older adults resulted in an increase in activations in occipito-parietal regions, but only for those who showed a training-related behavioral improvement.",
              "Young adults showed improvement in these regions as well, but also evidenced increases in frontal regions.",
              "Similarly, Carlson et al37 reported that older adults who were highly engaged in the Experience Corps intervention (a program where older adults engage in support and literacy activities for elementary teachers) showed an increase in prefrontal activity as well as an increase in executive function.",
              "Using a different approach, Mozolic et al38 examined changes in cerebral blood flow as a result of training.",
              "They reported that 6 weeks of attentional training in older adults resulted in an increase in cerebral blood flow to the prefrontal cortex during rest, combined with a decrease in distractibility.",
              "The neurological literature on cognitive training is at an early stage, and results are varied and actually quite limited.",
              "It is difficult to predict whether training will increase or decrease neural activity, and how it might interact with age, as well as how durable effects are over time.",
              "It also is surprisingly difficult to assess whether any observed brain changes reflect a fundamental increase in neural capacity or merely a change in strategy.",
              "Lo\u0308vde\u0301n et al39 suggest that specific strategy instructions operate to reduce performance differences between subjects because, in a sense, such instructions level the playing field so that old and young participants are more likely to use similar and optimal strategies.",
              "At the same time, Lo\u0308vde\u0301n et al39 observed that sustained cognitive training that followed the strategy instructions operated to magnify differences between individuals, because there was considerable heterogeneity in the ability of participants to profit from the training \u2014 that is, there were significant plasticity differences between subjects.",
              "These joint manipulations of instruction and training provided an elegant demonstration of how one might begin to separate strategy effects from changes in actual neural capacity.",
              "This brief discussion of the relationship between training effects and neural change highlights the complexity of the issues associated with training and neural function.",
              "Given the plethora of possibilities in findings, as well as the interpretations of those findings, associated with training, it would be wise for training studies that utilize neural measures to use training tasks that have been highly researched so that neural circuitry engaged by old and young is well understood.",
              "Moreover, a focus on studies with large participant pools, inclusion of a group that could replicate previous findings, and inclusion of long-term follow-up intervals will all enhance the quality of work and our understanding of the relationship among training, neural function, and behavioral improvement.",
              "One important aspect of training studies is whether the training results in broad changes in processing abilities that transfer to other unrelated tasks (so-called \u201cfar transfer\u201d) or whether it is only the trained ability that improves.",
              "40,41 This is in fact an age-old issue in the cognitive aging literature, dating back to early work done by Willis et al41 on the Seattle Longitudinal Study of Aging.",
              "It is clear from a raft of studies that older adults improve significantly on a trained task42 and that the training improvements in some cases are manifested for prolonged periods of time, even years later.",
              "43 Despite these encouraging findings, there is relatively little evidence that training induces a fundamental change in processes that transfer to everyday life.",
              "We do note that Willis et al43 reported that participants who were trained in reasoning in the ACTIVE trial42 reported less difficulty in instrumental activities of daily living 5 years later,43 a finding which is indicative of both far transfer and improvement in everyday function, but this is an uncommon finding.",
              "Furthermore, in the same study, training in speed of processing and episodic memory did not yield significant improvements, and thus the mediating mechanism for the improvement in daily activities resulting from reasoning training is not clear.",
              "Nevertheless, the results are encouraging.",
              "The concept of far transfer as a result of \u201cbrain training\u201d is highly appealing and is absolutely fundamental to claims that for-profit enterprises make about their neural facilitation products.",
              "The basic premise of these products is that their use (that typically involves extended training on tasks that train core cognitive processes) will literally make a person smarter and that the training will lead to broad improvement in many mental activities.",
              "Until recently, there was not strong evidence that this far transfer occurred, typically because appropriate control groups were not employed, or claims by purveyors of products were not rigorously evaluated.",
              "Recent work on working memory training, however, has yielded provocative evidence for far transfer from training on a working memory task to improvement in general intelligence.",
              "8 Findings indicate that young adults who are consistently challenged to increase their working memory span in an n-back paradigm are able to do so with training.",
              "More importantly, those participants who improve on the n-back training task show a significant increase in general measures of fluid intelligence.",
              "Thus far, the effects have been limited to young adults and, more recently, to children who showed an improvement in working memory from the original training.",
              "44 The only neural study of \u201cfar transfer\u201d of which we are aware was conducted by Dahlin et al.",
              "45 In this study, the researchers trained young and old on an updating task, a critical component of working memory function involving the ability to rapidly delete irrelevant information and integrate relevant information in working memory.",
              "When subjects were tested on a 3-back task, a related but different working memory task, they found young but not old showed transfer.",
              "Importantly, when the neural underpinnings of this effect were investigated, Dahlin et al5 reported that the trained updating task improved striatal function in young and that the striatal activation was shared by the 3-back transfer task.",
              "Importantly, older adults did not show striatal activity during training or during the transfer task.",
              "Thus, it appeared that striatal function was trained in young adults and the training transferred to other striatumbased tasks.",
              "This important result suggests that a neural process, rather than a task, was trained and that this is an effective mechanism for future training.",
              "1 We note as well that whether the transfer was \u201cfar\u201d is arguable.",
              "Both trained and transfer task relied on the same neural circuitry and, although the tasks were different, both were tasks that tapped into working memory.",
              "Finally, the fact that the training was unsuccessful in older adults is a caveat regarding the difficulties that will be encountered in neural training in later adulthood.",
              "There is at present little evidence that cognitive training on a task will improve general cognitive ability in old adults, despite a plethora of claims in the media.",
              "Nevertheless, extant data for young suggest that it is not implausible that such findings could emerge as we learn more about the basis for transfer effects.",
              "There are a range of studies that have demonstrated that cognitive training in older adults has resulted in gains over time for periods ranging from 3 months to 5 years.",
              "Mahncke et al46 trained participants extensively (1 hour per day for 8 to 10 weeks) on a series of computerized tasks designed to improve representational fidelity of language systems. Following training, subjects received a battery of neuropsychological tests and there was evidence that, despite no training specifically on memory, the training improved verbal memory on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS).",
              "47 Three months later, the participants showed an improvement in digit span forward scores relative to controls.",
              "These findings are interesting and provide some evidence for far transfer.",
              "It is unfortunate that the design of the study did not permit a second test of memory improvement at 3 months, and that a number of participants were initially at ceiling performance on the memory task, possibly limiting the impact of the intervention.",
              "A critical design feature of intervention studies is that the training and transfer tasks have sufficient range to accommodate the scores of both young and older adults.",
              "The tasks must have sufficient difficulty to challenge adults and avoid ceiling effects, but not be so difficult that floor is observed in the frailest adults or months after task performance.",
              "In a related study, Zelinski et al48 reported on a much larger sample (n =487) of older adults who received auditory language training similar to that of Mahncke et al46 or participated in control conditions.",
              "At 3-month follow-up after the language training, there was a significant improvement in tasks that were directly trained as well as in a memory composite score, but not in the RBANS memory task, as reported earlier by Mahncke et al.",
              "46 Overall, the results do provide some evidence for far transfer from auditory language training to a memory task as a result of training, but the findings are somewhat inconsistent across studies.",
              "As the authors note, it is both desirable and important to show some improvement in functional outcomes, and over longer periods of time.",
              "We also note that the Dahlin et al45 study discussed earlier reported that, although old adults did not show cognitive or neural facilitation on a transfer task after updating training, both young and old showed gains on the trained updating task.",
              "Of particular interest was the finding that older adults, when tested 18 months later, maintained gains that they demonstrated on the originally trained updating task.",
              "Overall, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that training gains can be maintained for long periods on the originally trained task, but that transfer effects are not easily demonstrated, particularly in older adults.",
              "Given these findings, perhaps the focus of training studies should be mainly on training skills and abilities that have pragmatic value and would be useful in everyday life.",
              "Cognitive training is time-consuming for the participant.",
              "If the primary gain to the trainee is that he or she becomes more efficient at the training task for a prolonged interval, the gain to the participant is slight.",
              "With more practical tasks, the time investments of both participants and staff are likely to lead to gains for the participant in their everyday life, even if they do not realize far transfer.",
              "There are a number of studies that suggest that older adults who maintain an active lifestyle or who engage in a range of intellectual pursuits are diagnosed at later ages with Alzheimer's disease.",
              "49 In fact, there is compelling evidence that a high level of education confers protection against neurocognitive aging and decline26 and is a type of cognitive reserve.",
              "The problem with these large epidemiological studies is that the data are primarily correlational, and it is not entirely clear if maintaining an active mind and lifestyle offers protection against cognitive aging, or whether those who are protected tend to maintain an active lifestyle.",
              "Nevertheless, the notion that staying mentally active confers protection against cognitive decline is pervasive and best represented by the frequently invoked adage of \u201cuse it or lose it.",
              "\u201d It is surprising that there is relatively little research that provides a careful test of this statement, and that is largely because it is quite difficult to study experimentally the effects of an engaged lifestyle.",
              "There are a few studies that have addressed this issue and all have shown positive but relatively limited effects.",
              "The Experience Corps Project37 examined the cognitive benefits of older adults working with teachers in programs to train literacy and provide educational assistance to young children.",
              "The program has shown that participation yielded cognitive, social, and health benefits to older adults, while at the same time giving back to the community.",
              "50 In addition, there is some evidence that participation increased neural activation in prefrontal cortex along with behavioral performance on executive function tasks.",
              "Another project that examines the role of sustained engagement on cognition is the Odyssey of the Mind Project.",
              "51 In this study, participants regularly participated in group problem-solving activities for several months with a culminating event that required elaborate team-based performance to present solutions to complex, ill-defined problems. In an initial study, Odyssey participants realized gains in fluid ability from pretest to post-test,53 and, in a later study, showed an enhancement in the personality trait of openness to experience.",
              "54 In recent work in our own laboratory, the Synapse project55 required that older adults participate in a demanding new learning task 15 hours a week for 3 months.",
              "Participants were immersed in what Park et al31 described as \u201cproductive engagement\u201d\u2014new learning that requires consistent engagement of working memory, motor skills, reasoning, and social challenge.",
              "Participants in productive engagement conditions learned quilting, digital photography, or both.",
              "Other participants were randomly assigned to \u201creceptive engagement\u201d conditions\u2014situations that involved stimulating social activities or use of existing knowledge but relatively little new learning.",
              "Results indicated that participants in the productive but not receptive engagement conditions showed improved episodic memory performance, a finding similar to the results from the Experience Corps Project.",
              "37 Although much more experimental work is needed on the issue of engagement, there is a small but promising body of literature which suggests that modest amount of cognitive gains can be realized by engagement in tasks that demand sustained cognitive effort.",
              "The engagement issue is an important one because engaging activities are intrinsically satisfying and can be sustained indefinitely with considerable pleasure.",
              "Unlike cognitive training that relies on computer training and may deprive individuals of social engagement and pursuit of satisfying activities, immersion in a social learning environment has the potential to confer cognitive protection while meeting basic psychological needs for social interactions and purpose in life.",
              "There is some evidence that the aging brain is malleable and that cognitive function can be facilitated through cognitive training or engagement in demanding tasks that provide a sustained cognitive challenge.",
              "Unfortunately, the most durable effects observed in old adults are gains on the trained task, with only limited evidence that \u201cfar transfer\u201d (ie, improvement on an array of tasks that share similarity in processes but not content to the trained task) is possible.",
              "Nevertheless, the persistence of training effects over a period of years is both impressive and somewhat unexpected.",
              "Despite remarkable tools to examine neural structure and function in the aging brain, a great deal of work needs to be done to understand whether changes in neural function are indicative of neural plasticity or merely represent shifts in strategy.",
              "Evidence suggests that older adults show less neuroplasticity than younger subjects, and we argue that interventions that successfully delay agerelated cognitive decline will yield greater benefits than short-term facilitation of cognition.",
              "An important aspect of cognitive enhancement techniques that is not considered sufficiently is how enjoyable the activities to be performed are.",
              "We argue that engagement in challenging leisure activities that activate core cognitive processes such as working memory, episodic memory, and reasoning may ultimately prove to be more effective than computer-based training techniques due to the ability to of older adults to sustain interesting leisure activities indefinitely.",
              "One of the greatest research challenges facing this domain of research is to demonstrate that cognitive training results in meaningful gains in everyday life or delays onset of Alzheimer's disease or other neurological disorders.",
              "Another area of particular importance is understanding the meaning of neural change and what type of neural change represents enhancement (eg, decreased activity could represent enhanced neural efficiency or insufficient neural engagement).",
              "The field would greatly profit from evidence for replicability of important findings.",
              "Claims that older adults can greatly improve their intellectual capacity or prevent Alzheimer's disease through \u201cbrain training\u201d appear, at this time, to be overstated.",

              "Neuroplasticity is simple as a concept, but extremely complex when it comes to its mechanisms. This review aims to bring to light an aspect about neuroplasticity that is often not given enough attention as it should, the fact that the brain\u2019s ability to change would include its ability to disconnect synapses.",
              "So, neuronal shrinkage, decrease in spine density or dendritic complexity should be included within the concept of neuroplasticity as part of its mechanisms, not as an impairment of it.",
              "To that end, we extensively describe a variety of studies involving topics such as neurodevelopment, aging, stress, memory and homeostatic plasticity to highlight how the weakening and disconnection of synapses organically permeate the brain in so many ways as a good practice of its intrinsic physiology.",
              "Therefore, we propose to break down neuroplasticity into two sub-concepts, \u201cupward neuroplasticity\u201d for changes related to synaptic construction and \u201cdownward neuroplasticity\u201d for changes related to synaptic deconstruction.",
              "With these sub-concepts, neuroplasticity could be better understood from a bigger landscape as a vector in which both directions could be taken for the brain to flexibly adapt to certain demands.",
              "Such a paradigm shift would allow a better understanding of the concept of neuroplasticity to avoid any data interpretation bias, once it makes clear that there is no morality with regard to the organic and physiological changes that involve dynamic biological systems as seen in the brain.",
              "The etymology of neuroplasticity breaks it down into two basic morphemes: neuro- plastic;",
              "with the \u201cplastic\u201d originally meaning \u201csuitable for molding\u201d as it comes first from the Greek term \u201cplastiko\u0301s\u201d and later from the Latin \u201cplasticus\u201d.",
              "As a concept, neuroplasticity means the nervous system\u2019s ability to reorganize its structure and functioning in response to some stimuli, either intrinsic or extrinsic [1].",
              "Although simple in definition, the historical ground behind this concept relies entirely on the shoulders of magnificent and pioneering scientists.",
              "From a philosophical perspective, plasticity roots, as a reference to the nervous system, are still a matter of debate and have been tracked back to Willian James (1890), Santiago Ramo\u0301n y Cajal (1894) and Demor (1896) in the late 1800s or Lugaro (1906) and Minea (1909) in the early 1900s [2,3,4].",
              "However, the practical relevance of the neuroplasticity only began to be unveiled in the mid-20th century by Paul Bach-y-Rita who built the concept of sensory substitution by proposing that other brain areas may assume functions previously mediated by a lost neural tissue [5].",
              "Similarly, based on Wilder Penfield works that showed a motor and sensory cortical representation of the body [6], Michael Merzenich noted that the adult brain is actually a dynamic structure, with the cortical body representations constantly shifting its boundaries [7].",
              "Intriguing, Merzenich\u2019s findings were initially criticized by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, two eminent neuroscientists at Johns Hopkins who had found a critical period for visual cortex plasticity to allow visual processing input to be replaced by the non-deprived eye at the expense of the deprived one [8, 9].",
              "All the field advancement has not come without the controversy of the unknown and, not surprisingly, for so long the adult brain was considered hard-wired, incapable of any accommodation.",
              "However, after some breakthroughs, neuroplasticity is now well recognized as a fundamental and lifelong brain property.",
              "Although partially compromised, compared to early neurodevelopment, adult brain remodeling is still salient and fairly required for learning/experience- and internal milieu-based behavioral adjustments [10].",
              "Bearing in mind a broader perspective of a flexible brain, we will go through studies related to early neurodevelopment, aging, stress, memory, and homeostatic plasticity to propose that brain flexibility goes beyond the obvious to include the concepts of \u201cupward\u201d and \u201cdownward\u201d to neuroplasticity.",
              "Such sub-concepts aim to clarify how neuroplasticity is not only about building, but also about dismantling.",
              "Humans are born with tens of billions of brain cells and a single neuron may contact as far as 15,000 other cells, moreover a 3 years old child\u2019s brain has established nearly 1000 trillion synapses [11].",
              "The immature nervous system has a fundamentally redundant neuro-circuitry, as evidenced by the cortical dendritic spine density exceeded in childhood by one and a half to threefold that of adult\u2019s brain [12, 13].",
              "Higher synaptic density of the cerebral cortex was also found in early postnatal development of monkeys [14, 15], rats [16] and kittens [17], compared to adult animals.",
              "Cajal in the late 19th had already noticed that the spine density of pyramidal neurons throughout early postnatal development is greater than in adulthood [18].",
              "Overabundant synapses were proposed as an endeavor by the brain to generate a diversity of connections beyond genetic anchorage, as activity-induced stabilization selects from the overproduced synapses those to remain [19, 20].",
              "Accordingly, multiple retinal inputs converge onto immature lateral geniculate nucleus in both mice and ferrets, most of which are eliminated to just a few be maintained into adulthood [21, 22].",
              "It was then proposed that the fuzzy retinogeniculate connections from early development would support the polishing of geniculocortical connections in late development to sharpen thalamocortical topography and likely also fine tune the orientation of cortical receptive fields [22].",
              "Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has also been a highly successful model to study developmental synaptic pruning.",
              "Early in development, one muscle fiber stablishes weak connections with about ten overly intermingled motor nerve axons, most of which (except for one) are further eliminated through the next postnatal couple of weeks [23].",
              "Interestingly, increasing divergence in synaptic strength was observed before one of the two axonal inputs was removed from the shared mice muscle fiber, as the survivor earned vigor by increasing its quantal content and the defeated one became gradually weaker up to full withdrawal within 1 to 2 days [24].",
              "Indeed, axons broaden their territory in response to previously evacuated sites, since the \u201csoon-to-be-eliminated axon\u201d still takes over the NMJ after laser removal of the strongest input [25].",
              "Similarly, such refinement is widely established throughout early neurodevelopment on several occasions as a matter of axonal disconnection, as it follows: thalamic connection with the layer IV cells of the visual cortex is disrupted [26];",
              "preganglionic inputs are disconnected from submandibular ganglion cells [27];",
              "and climbing fibers disassemble from cerebellar Purkinje cells [28, 29].",
              "The hippocampus is also target of developmental remodeling as the projections of pyramidal cells from the hippocampus to the medial septum are transient in rats and abruptly withdraw after birth [30].",
              "Furthermore, the mossy fibers (infrapyramidal bundle) carrying intra hippocampal axons from the dentate gyrus (DG) to CA3 dramatically retract between the third and fourth week after mice are born [31].",
              "Interestingly, early neurodevelopmental refinement has also been noticed from non-mammalian species, such as in the auditory systems of chicks [32] and in the visual system of tadpoles [33].",
              "Drosophila metamorphosis prompts also to the loss of the dendritic arbor and axonal branches after puparium formation [34, 35].",
              "Which means that the brain\u2019s basic genetic program responsible for the ability to trigger early development-based abundance of synapses is, at least partially, presumable as evolutionarily conserved in different classes of animals, including invertebrates such as insects.",
              "However, different cellular mechanism may still be involved in synaptic pruning under different circumstances [36].",
              "Besides, according to most evidence, developmental synaptic pruning or input disconnection has been usually acknowledged to be complete around early phases, or even when young people reach puberty or late adolescence.",
              "Consistently, callosal axons in newborn monkeys outnumber those in adults, and about 70% of these axons disappear months after birth [37].",
              "Still, while young mice had 73% of the spines in layer-5 pyramidal neurons (primary visual cortex) stable over one-month interval, with changes primarily related to spine removal, adult mice had 96% of the spines stable for longer than 13 months [38].",
              "Therefore, throughout early development, nervous system maturation has the highly dynamic process of neuronal remodeling as its hallmark and synaptic pruning is ubiquitously part of this complex rearrangement [39].",
              "So, an embryonic and transient template, generous in promiscuous synapses, gradually gives place to a keen adult pattern of activity-driven neuronal connectivity as the repertoire of possible circuit configurations is pruning-based refined [36].",
              "More than a passive process, developmental pruning follows Hebb\u2019s rule whereas asynchrony, but no synchrony, between action potential achieves competing terminals to trigger input concurrence and further synaptic elimination [40].",
              "Altogether, activity-guided neuronal disconnection is part of a successful and universal developmental program, occurring naturally throughout the nervous system, as well as in different species, and timely-frame coordinated according to each network, in order to forge and fine-tune connections to then enable minute idiosyncratic adaptations that fit into individual experiences and distinct surrounding factors.",
              "Even at lower levels, be aware that the adult brain is still undergoing remodeling whereas spine lifespans vary widely.",
              "For instance, notwithstanding dendritic branches in the barrel cortex of adult mice are quite stable over weeks and close to 50% of dendritic spines may persist for at least a month, surprisingly the remaining ones are only present for a few days [41].",
              "For the human prefrontal cortex (PFC), developmental remodeling of the brain based on the pruning of superfluous spines extends even into the third decade of life [42].",
              "Outstanding, these latest findings from human brain enlarge neurodevelopment beyond adolescence, and such elongated phase of reorganization implies the prefrontal cortex longer vulnerable to the environment in its most labile arrangement, thus a sensitive substrate for late-onset neuropsychiatry disorders [42].",
              "For a brief overview of the topic, see Fig.",
              "1.",
              "Although the unmatured brain overflows with synaptic connections, such a developmental program goes beyond any triviality.",
              "Excessive synapses are extremely important for the brain to be able to readily fine-tune idiosyncratic connections to the demands of a rather \u201cnai\u0308ve\u201d brain.",
              "In this way, seemingly superfluous connections make the brain prone to adapt, evolve and be molded around the behavioral repertoires that best predict continued future success.",
              "Within a concept, the time frame of promiscuous synapses could be understood as a window of opportunity in which the set of actions involving synaptic disconnections would be the tools that really makes this a good and profitable occasion.",
              "So, since the very newborn brain beginning, connections are ready to be plastically refined under the guidance of neuronal activities that mirror the nearby niche of an ever-changing environment.",
              "Furthermore, from an evolutionary perspective, pruning-based neuronal refinement of a redundant brain is likely a highly conserved mechanism as it can be found from insects to humans.",
              "Developmental synaptic pruning related to neuronal refinement shifts over a continuum of time to a non-pathological and cumulative process of synaptic deterioration that irreversibly affects all maturing organisms, causing aging to intrinsically make the individual unable to properly adapt to the environment.",
              "Although aging is a genuine event, it is a major risk factor for the emergence of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases [43, 44].",
              "Nevertheless, the occurrence of age-related cognitive decline is highly variable and is generally within the range for which aging may not yet be considered part of any neuropathology [45].",
              "For a brief overview of the topic, see Fig.",
              "2.",
              "After a period of developmental neural refinement based on synaptic pruning, all organisms undergo non-pathological, cumulative, and irreversible synaptic deterioration as they age.",
              "Morphological changes in aged brains may be subtle as they are region-specific and often restricted to neuronal types or dendritic branches, usually resulting in synaptic strength deficits and some sort of brain shrinkage.",
              "Although synaptic corrosion in the elderly is usually associated with some level of cognitive decline, healthy aging is expected to be unrelated to any pathological problem.",
              "However, even for healthy aging, a small cognitive decline associated with synaptic pruning can be a burden in practice as it makes the individual less able to readily adapt to the surrounding environment.",
              "Back to 1955, Brody claimed that age-linked shrinkage of the human brain was due, in part, to a decay in the number of cortical neurons [46].",
              "Subsequent studies corroborated it by showing a decline in cortical neuron density, as well as cell loss in cortical and subcortical areas of elderly humans and non-human primates [47,48,49].",
              "However, with the advancement of stereological methods new studies have identified these earlier data as confounding and likely biased by shrinkage artefacts and the mistaken inclusion of diseased samples [50, 51].",
              "Yet, presynaptic terminal count was negatively correlated with age in individuals older than 60 years, averaging thus a 20% decrease in density of presynaptic terminals within the frontal cortex [52].",
              "A 10% reduction per decade was also found in the total length of myelinated fibers, the main components of the white matter, adding up to 45% when the comparison was made directly between individuals aged around 20 and 80 years [53].",
              "Similar to humans, in addition to decreased dendritic complexity, age-related changes in the non-human primate neocortex include a significant reduction in the number and density of spines [54, 55].",
              "Further, ultrastructural inspection of white matter fiber tracts in aged rhesus monkey\u2019s brain suggests an overall defective orchestrated driving of neuronal signals with the breakdown of the myelin sheath structure [56,57,58].",
              "Indeed, such aging disconnection has been supported by independent rodent studies as, rather than loss of neurons, numerous cortical and subcortical areas show subtle, neuronal type-specific morphological changes involving the number of synaptic contacts and/or dendritic branches [59,60,61,62,63,64,65].",
              "Some changes though may depend on whether the aged animal behaves cognitively normal or not [66].",
              "Finally, even though the effects of aging are mostly drawn from the vertebrate\u2019s brain, typically mammals, notably aged invertebrates such as insects, including fruit flies, honeybees, crickets and cockroaches also manifest a range of disconnection-like synaptic alterations [51].",
              "While long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent increase in synaptic strength that favors signal transmission between neurons, its counterpart long-term depression (LTD) is a long-lasting reduction in neurotransmission efficacy [67].",
              "Both are activity-dependent phenomena, which happen according to some pattern of electrical stimulation.",
              "In general, aging is associated with certain levels of hippocampal LTP impairment [68,69,70,71,72,73].",
              "Interestingly, aging-related LTP deficit may depend on whether the animals show cognitive shortage [74].",
              "As non-invasive brain stimulation methods have been increasingly useful in extending the science of LTP to humans as well [75], paired associative stimulation has shown a reduced LTP-like plasticity in the motor cortex of elderly humans [76, 77].",
              "Alternatively to transcranial magnetic stimulation, photic tetanus induced a LTP-like visual plasticity that was not properly augmented in older humans [78].",
              "On the other hand, older rats seem to be more sensitive to hippocampal LTD induction or LTP reversal [72, 79,80,81].",
              "Strikingly, serial electron microscopy of the CA1 synapses highlighted the existence in aged mice of multi-innervated dendritic spines, which would otherwise rarely be seen [82];",
              "while 3D reconstructions of somatic, dendritic and axonal mitochondria in DG and CA1 found niche-specific morphological alterations by comparing aged to young adult mice [83].",
              "Both respective findings could somehow, at least partially, explain the previously described age-related changes in synaptic strength.",
              "For example, multi-innervated dendritic spines may be redundant and their assembly appears to compete for downstream signaling linked to LTP induction [82].",
              "Besides, mitochondria play a pivotal role in Ca2+ buffering and therefore tune neuronal communication and plasticity, in addition to defining axonal and dendritic growth according to their location [83].",
              "Although the brain\u2019s cell proliferation program is extensively abolished throughout neurodevelopment, still some neuronal niches retain their proliferative precursors and thus are continually capable of producing adult-born neurons.",
              "That is particularly true for the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles (SVZ) and the subgranular zone of the hippocampal DG (SGZ).",
              "While SVZ neuroblasts advance along the rostral migratory stream to mainly reach the olfactory bulb and differentiate into interneurons, SGZ neuroblasts shortly migrate to adjacent granular cell layer to differentiate into excitatory neurons [84].",
              "To make this topic brief and of easier reading, below we will focus on the SGZ as it is of greater interest to humans and better studied than the SVZ.",
              "Subpopulations of neural stem cells (NSC) in the SGZ switch from a mitotically active to a quiescent state in aged mice [85], which likely accounts for the progressive age-related impairment of proliferation, and consequently also for the disruption of either the survival, migration or differentiation of DG newborn cells [86,87,88,89,90,91].",
              "However, both the quiescent and amplifying NSCs were actually found to continuously decrease over aging, once after exiting the quiescent state the NSC sustains a journey of asymmetric divisions to establish neuronal progenies before definitively becoming a mature astrocyte [92].",
              "Such an interesting model to simultaneously explain aging-related phenomena involving the emergence of new astrocytes, the wane of neurogenesis and the decay of hippocampal NSCs.",
              "A prominent and progressive age-related decline in DG neurogenesis has also been found from non-human primates [93,94,95].",
              "A comparison among different rodent strains and three other non-human primate species suggests that the decline in NSC proliferation, to a lesser extent also the decline in neurogenesis, actually follows absolute rather than relative age [96].",
              "Hence, a sharp decrease in postnatal neurogenesis appears in rodents at intermediate to older phases whereas in non-human primates this happens at much earlier stages.",
              "Since a groundbreaking study revealed that the human hippocampus keeps generating neurons throughout life [97], adult neurogenesis has become a hot topic in human research.",
              "Likewise non-human primates, studies have observed in human DG that the number of neuroblasts decreases drastically over the early postnatal years, but that those remaining into adulthood still moderately decay with aging [98,99,100].",
              "Making of neurogenesis actually a burning topic, some studies have contradictorily claimed that if DG neurogenesis happens during adulthood, it is nevertheless extremely rare [101, 102].",
              "Although negative results from immunohistological post-mortem samples were argued to not have been optimized for detecting adult DG neurogenesis [103], even small neurogenesis levels are hypothesized to provide a reservoir of cells that would operate like a bottleneck within the reverberated hippocampal circuitry [104] as immature attributes of adult-born DG neurons appear to be long-lasting in human [105] and nonhuman primates [106] while holding a critical period of improved synaptic plasticity [107,108,109].",
              "By detecting and correlating activity oscillations in segregated areas, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have consistently found older humans with lower connectivity between regions of the default mode network (DMN), which includes the lateral parietal cortex, precuneus, posterior cingulate (Cg) cortex, hippocampus and medial PFC - mPFC [110, 111].",
              "The DMN maintains strong connectivity and functional organization during ongoing resting state, but decreases its functionality (intrinsic activity) under attention-demanding tasks [112].",
              "DMN activity has been associated to several cognitive skills, in addition to assist emotional processing, recall of previous experiences and self-referential mental activities [112, 113], and reduced DMN functional connectivity in healthy aging predicts poorer performance on memory tasks and executive functions [114,115,116].",
              "Resembling social networks, brain is a complex large-scale network, topologically proficient and anatomically wired to balance energetic costs, that covers subnetworks or systems/modules of highly intricate nodes - neurons or brain areas [117].",
              "Regions of interest (ROI)- and graph theoretical-based fMRI connectome analyses broadly agree that elders at rest exhibit lower within- and higher between-modules functional connectivity than younger adults [118, 119], which suggests some level of shortage regarding the independence of brain systems. Accordingly, aging comprises less subnetworks segregation, and the lower the system specialization the worse the episodic memory scores [120].",
              "A longitudinal study used a linear mixed modeling-based fMRI analysis to assess the complex brain networks of healthy older adults along 4 years and found that the gradual erosion of subnetworks segregation at rest correlated with aging-associated decline in cognitive performance [121].",
              "Moreover, older adults also appear to have less modularity and less local efficiency compared to youngers [122, 123].",
              "Modularity (number of functional modules) and local efficiency are fairly related to each other as denser local connections between the topologically closest neighbors of a node are prone to make the brain network more modular, which would favor local efficiency by enabling better adaptability of specialized information processing and its segregated transfer within reasonably autonomous dynamic brain subnetworks [117].",
              "Age-related differences in the structural white matter connectome bring patterns of results similar to those of functional connectivity studies.",
              "For example, based on graphical theoretical indices derived from diffusion MRI tractography, older individuals were noted to have poorer anatomical organization related to global cortical connectivity (i.",
              "e. bigger network cost) and local efficiency [124].",
              "Using a similar method, global/local network efficiency and strength of intra/inter-modular connections were observed to peak around the third decade of life to then progressively decline with aging, whereas hub (nodes with high degree of network connectivity) integration and long-range connections linearly diminished throughout aging [125].",
              "Indeed, long-range functional connectivity density was proposed to be more susceptible to the intrinsic effects of healthy aging [126].",
              "Tract-based spatial statistics analysis of diffusion tensor imaging data also disclosed a profile of larger extracellular volumes and lower membrane densities as a consequence of a widely disrupted white matter in a diverse set of brain structures in older compared with younger adults [127, 128].",
              "Therefore, whether by structural or functional connectome, integrity of the brain\u2019s network seems to undergo an overall and solid decline from midlife onwards.",
              "Unlike to intrinsic factors driving synaptic pruning throughout neurodevelopment and aging, the ongoing art of living also includes a myriad of extrinsic factors, such as life stressors, still capable of disconnecting the brain.",
              "Stress could be conceptualized as a perception of threat, real or imagined, actual or anticipated, emotional or physical, where an individual undergoes some level of emotional discomfort and physiological changes that might lead to maladaptive behavioral adjustments.",
              "Stress responses are rather complex and dynamic, comprising a symphony of molecular and neuronal rearrangements that are coordinated at multiple levels to ideally orchestrate an optimal response to threatening challenges [129].",
              "Thus, the stress response has originally evolved to bring the organism back to body homeostasis, protecting individuals from acute stress and maintaining their fundamental sense of well-being [130].",
              "Additionally, in its optimal construct, the stress response may even be crucial for an individual\u2019s optimal adaptation to the environment by triggering better experience-based homeostatic power [130].",
              "However, prolonged exposure to stress often unbalances the stress response system towards a maladaptive homeostasis, from which several neuropsychiatric illnesses could be precipitated, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 PTSD [131].",
              "Below, some stress-related brain changes.",
              "For a brief overview of the topic, see Fig.",
              "3.",
              "As an extrinsic factor capable of altering the brain, the concept of stress is based on nothing more than our bodily ability to perceive threats, real or imagined, actual or anticipated, emotional or physical.",
              "Such a realization is then accompanied by a sense of emotional inconvenience and extensive physiological changes that should, in principle, help us orchestrate the best adaptive behavior for survival, but which may actually lead to maladaptive behavioral adjustments.",
              "Indeed, a myriad of conditions can be perceived as stressful and the extent of brain effects may vary depending on the interplay between individual resilience and how long that stress lasts.",
              "Such effects include microstructural and subsequent macrofunctional changes, both of which are usually, but not only, coupled with the triggering of synaptic disconnections.",
              "Interestingly, stress-induced brain morphofunctional changes are generally recoverable.",
              "The effects of stress can overlap with the effects of neurodevelopment and aging on the brain, as we are all susceptible to stressors throughout our lives.",
              "Lifelong stress exposure may induce cumulative brain structural changes, including frontoparietal network disturbances and decreased PFC/insula gray/white matter [132,133,134].",
              "Shrinkage of several cortical structures has also been reported in children who have suffered physical/sexual assault [135, 136].",
              "Childhood stress also promotes lasting brain changes beyond youth as retrospective and prospective studies detail how early life adversities can cause the thinning of various cortical structures in adulthood [137,138,139,140,141].",
              "Strikingly, personal experiences of abuse may head brain changes specifically to regions involved with that particular adverse sensory input.",
              "Accordingly, cortical structures relevant to self-awareness and self-assessment were thinner in the case of adult women emotionally abused in childhood, while early sexual abuse was mainly associated with thinning of the genital representation field lying over the primary somatosensory cortex [142].",
              "In addition, adults exposed to parental verbal abuse during childhood showed loss of integrity in neuronal pathways involved with language development [143].",
              "Also, the gray matter of the visual cortex is shrunken in young adults who have been sexually abused or witnessed domestic violence during childhood [144, 145].",
              "The hippocampus of adult individuals was also found to be smaller the greater their lifetime exposure to stressful situations, including financial problems [146,147,148].",
              "Additionally, the higher the level of perceived stress or the earlier the adverse experience, the lower the hippocampal volumes in adolescents [149, 150].",
              "Also, a thorough analysis showed that adults who experienced childhood trauma had lower volumes of all hippocampal subfields [151, 152].",
              "Therefore, a myriad of different stressors is capable of inducing neuronal disconnection, especially those carried early on life.",
              "Importantly, each type of stressor may induce specific synaptic disruption, but keep in mind that brain rearrangement goes further, as some neurocircuits are actually reinforced rather than weakened.",
              "It\u2019s also worth noting that although we have focused primarily on data about cortical and subcortical areas, such as hippocampus, the stress-triggered changes are in fact pervasive throughout the brain [153].",
              "Strikingly, animal studies have found that volumetric brain distortions are positively coupled to neuronal remodeling, thus convincingly demonstrating that regional shifts in spine density and dendritic arborization likely underlie gray matter changes [154, 155].",
              "So, in accordance to previous human data, hippocampus seems to be particularly damaged after stress exposure.",
              "For example, rats exposed daily to a restraint [156, 157] or immobilization [158] stress had a decrease in the total length and branch points of the CA3 hippocampal apical dendrites.",
              "The same changes were observed in tree shrews daily subordinated to a dominant male [159].",
              "Hippocampus is a complex structure, with a reverberant circuitry where apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons accumulate spines or thorny excrescences along their proximal segments to synapse mossy fiber inputs from DG granule neurons [160].",
              "Hence, those previous findings probably reflect ultrastructural changes in DG-CA3 synapses, once rats chronically restraint-stressed exhibited rearrangements in vesicle clusters and mitochondrial occupancy of mossy fiber terminals [161], along with a retraction in postsynaptic thorny excrescences and reduction of their endosome-like structures [162].",
              "Accordingly, rats chronically restraint-stressed showed extensive loss of mossy fiber contacts on CA3 thorny excrescences [163].",
              "In fact, a thorough reorganization has been observed across all hippocampal subfields in rats under a mild but chronic and unpredictable stress regime, changes which include atrophy, decreased spine density and dendritic length [164,165,166].",
              "Longitudinal MRI of rats before and after a chronic restraint stress schedule corroborated a 3% reduction in hippocampal volume [167].",
              "Even a short resident-intruder stress paradigm promoted a prolonged decrease in dendritic length and spine density of CA1 pyramidal neurons in socially defeated rats [168].",
              "Hippocampal cell death has also been observed short-transiently after one-day stress or long-lasting after a chronic unpredictable stress protocol [89].",
              "Another study found increased levels of apoptosis in DG and entorhinal cortex of subordinate tree shrews who underwent to resident-intruder model [169].",
              "Importantly, although stress can affect hippocampal neuroplasticity similarly in its most dorsal and ventral part [170], some effects may appear stronger in the ventral hippocampus [171], what would be in line with its predominant functional role in modulating neuroendocrine and emotional/motivational responses to stress [172].",
              "Although the functional role of SGZ adult-born neurons is still a matter of debate, several studies suggest that these neurons are important for neuronal pattern separation and contextual discrimination [173].",
              "Focusing on hippocampus, hypothetically neurogenesis bias neuronal coding by avoiding proactive interferences and generalizations, making thus the brain capable of accurately updating spatiotemporal information (cognitive flexibility) to further build a proper stress response and adapt to the demands of an ever-changing environment [174].",
              "So, it is not a surprise that stress disrupts DG neurogenesis.",
              "Accordingly, 6 weeks of rat restraint stress decreased the proliferation of DG precursor cells, attenuated the survival of adult-newborn neurons, while concurrently decreased the number of granule cells and consequently granule cell layer volume [175].",
              "Furthermore, seven days after inescapable shocks, or 24 h after a 45-min restraint stress, rats exhibited a reduction in DG cell proliferation [176].",
              "Indeed, escapable shocks immediately reduced DG cell proliferation while inescapable shocks induced a longer-lasting detrimental effect [177].",
              "A 6 weeks protocol of chronic mild stress robustly attenuated DG neurogenesis by about 40% [165].",
              "Interestingly, a day of stress affected DG cell proliferation for no longer than 24 h, however a 3-week regimen of chronic unpredictable stress induced a lasting impairment with only an incomplete recovery around the third week of no further stress [89].",
              "Chronic mild stress also suppressed cell proliferation and reduced the total number of granule cells in the rat ventral granule cell layer [178].",
              "Marmoset monkey\u2019s brain is also vulnerable to stress, as a single exposure to a resident conspecific for 1 h reduced DG cell proliferation [179].",
              "Since there are 5000 times more synapses than neurons in the brain [180], many studies report stress largely affecting functional synaptic plasticity as well.",
              "Accordingly, the induction of LTP in adult rats, specifically from stimulation of medial perforant inputs to DG or commissural pathways to CA3, was suppressed after a 21-day schedule of restraint stress [181].",
              "A single exposure of adult rats to an elevated platform for 30 min was able to impair hippocampal CA1 LTP in vivo and favor the appearance of a reliable LTD, which under control conditions would not occur [182].",
              "Interestingly, prejudice in CA1 LTP was more pronounced in mature animals exposed to uncontrollable Morris water maze stress (no platform), when compared to the controllable stress group whose platform was present [183].",
              "An impairment of CA1 and DG LTP was also observed in ex vivo hippocampal slices of grown-up animals previously stressed in a 21-day variable stress paradigm [184].",
              "Early-postnatal stress (fragmented maternal care) also had an impact over aging rats, as middle-aged, but not young adults, presented an impairment of ex vivo CA3 LTP and a decrease in the hippocampal complexity of CA1 dendritic tree [185].",
              "It is important to pinpoint, though, that stress will not always induce a loss in LTP, actually it may be even enhanced, or unchanged, depending on many factors such as the feature of stress and stress response phase [186].",
              "Besides, for a long time LTP and LTD were conceived as electrophysiological phenomena predominantly implicated in brain areas whose role was associated with memory processing, such as the hippocampus.",
              "However, now it is well known that LTP and LTD are indeed widespread, from spinal cord to neocortex, and that memory storage is much more complex than previously thought and requires a large and integrative brain network [180].",
              "The mPFC includes different subregions such as the Cg, prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) areas, and the preclinical evidence gathered so far poses that all of these structures are largely affected by stress as well.",
              "For instance, in addition to shortening spine density, chronic daily restraint stress reduced the total length and branch numbers of the apical dendrites in Cg and PrL pyramidal neurons [187,188,189,190], an outcome that likely mirror the atrophy of terminals branches [191].",
              "On closer examination, the same stress scheme reduced the volume, length and surface area of these apical dendritic spines, overall decreasing the density of the larger dendritic spines while increasing those of the thinner ones [192].",
              "Seven days of daily brief restraint-stress was still capable of inducing a substantial shrinkage of the Cg apical dendrites [193].",
              "Moreover, ten days of daily immobilization stress was sufficient to shoot down IL branch points and the overall length of apical dendrites from randomly selected or entorhinal cortex-projecting neurons [194].",
              "Even a single exposure to the stressful forced swim [195] or elevated platform [196] arouse a retraction in apical dendrites of IL pyramidal neurons.",
              "Additionally, a chronic model of unpredictable stress led to a large volumetric shrinkage of the mPFC, as it includes all subregions, and additionally disrupted the PrL LTP acquired from high-frequency stimulation of the ventral hippocampus CA1 [197].",
              "Excess of glucocorticoid is supposed to underlie the stress effects, at least partially, on synaptic disconnections [198].",
              "Therefore, it is noteworthy that the brain changes triggered by corticosteroid treatment resemble those described previously for stressed animals [199].",
              "Memory is an essential cognitive function that, due to complexity, is often described apart into at least three main stages: acquisition or encoding, consolidation and retrieval.",
              "During encoding, sensory information is received by the brain, neuronal excitability is altered and synaptic plasticity starts being established.",
              "Memory is then progressively consolidated through changes in synaptic connections as it is retained as a memory trace.",
              "Finally, under predictive cues memory retrieval emerges [200, 201].",
              "Since we are all surrounded by an ever-changing environment and constantly subject to routine bodily sensory updating, after retrieving a memory multiple destinies are still possible, such as reconsolidation, extinction and forgetting [202].",
              "By definition, reconsolidation opens a novel temporal window of lability that allows the original memory to be modified [203, 204].",
              "On the other hand, the extinction process occurs when a new memory trace competes with the original one [205, 206].",
              "Forgetting, in turn, is characterized as a physiological phenomenon in which unnecessary information decays over time [207].",
              "Here, we will focus on studies showing that downward synaptic plasticity is required for adulthood memory formation as well as for post-retrieval processes to be established.",
              "Although counterintuitive, analogous to neurodevelopment, activity-dependent synaptic disconnection is also important during the animal\u2019s adulthood so that its brain circuits, whose neuronal coding underlies memory storage, are refined [208].",
              "Also, suppressing neuronal ensembles associated with the foundation of a previous memory may favor subsequent learning/memory by reducing any potential interference [209].",
              "For a brief overview of the topic, see Fig.",
              "4.",
              "Downward structural changes such as spine removal and/or dendritic shrinkage underlie the functional weakening of synaptic strength that happens during LTD and in some specific phases of memory.",
              "Each memory phase has its particular cellular mechanism, however some of them are shared.",
              "The bottom figure abridges how AMPAR/GluA2 internalization triggered by NMDAR/GluN2B-mediated LTD is a fundamental shared cellular mechanism by which synaptic weakening happens in all these memory processes.",
              "Classical studies correlate learning and memory with increased synaptic efficacy [210].",
              "However, there is currently no doubt that decrement in synaptic efficacy may also support memory formation [211,212,213,214].",
              "Accordingly, spatial learning triggered endogenous LTD [215, 216].",
              "While LTD and LTP share some molecular mechanisms that are required for memory formation, e.",
              "g. activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), unlike LTP, LTD requires endocytosis of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs), which are generally found in postsynaptic density [211, 217, 218].",
              "Hence, blocking the GluN2B subunit of NMDARs, or AMPAR endocytosis, disrupted both LTD- and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory [219,220,221,222].",
              "Additionally, it was demonstrated that LTD mediated by GluA2 (AMPAR subunit) endocytosis in the apical inputs to CA1 neurons is crucial for the establishment of place fields during spatial learning [223].",
              "At the circuitry level, it was shown that new experiences activate the locus coeruleus to release noradrenaline into the hippocampus, mediating thus spatial learning through LTD along Schaffer collaterals-CA1 synapses [224].",
              "Therefore, it is clear that synaptic weakening and its underlying cellular mechanisms are essential for shaping hippocampus-dependent spatial memories.",
              "Extinction and forgetting may involve functional and structural reorganization of synapses that were potentiated throughout the original learning [207, 225].",
              "First, be aware that the neurobiological mechanism underpinning the reduction in synaptic strength, in addition to LTD, might also imply depotentiation (induction of synaptic depression following LTP) and LTP decay [226].",
              "Recent studies, in fact, have shown that the blockade of NMDARs in the hippocampus prevents forgetting [227] and also the LTP decay [228, 229], indicating that forgetting actually takes place as an active rather than a passive process.",
              "In addition, NMDAR-mediated calcium entry activates calcineurin [229] and synaptotagamin-3 [230], both of which ultimately lead to the removal of GluA2-AMPARs from hippocampal synapses and cause a reduction in synaptic strength [230, 231], then favoring forgetting.",
              "Likewise, blocking synaptic removal of GluA2-AMPARs prevented depotentiation [231].",
              "Comparably to forgetting, GluA2-AMPAR endocytosis has also been implied on memory extinction [232].",
              "Accordingly, extinction reduced the surface expression of AMPAR subunits to pre-conditioning levels whereas depotentiated the conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation from the internal capsule to the lateral amygdala in a NMDAR-dependent manner [233].",
              "The neuronal response to fear conditioned tone was indeed shown to return to baseline levels after extinction, thus indicating that the synaptic connection from auditory sensory input to the lateral amygdala is somehow reset by extinction [234].",
              "Extinction memory was also shown to suppress the reactivation of contextual fear engram cells while activating another distinct ensemble in the hippocampus [235].",
              "At last, synaptic depression of basolateral amygdala (BLA) inputs to PrL and IL mPFC improved extinction memory as it led to a more efficient reduction in fear expression [236].",
              "Although we have focused on describing how the decreased synaptic strength/activity of a previously fear consolidated memory might be a crucial mechanism for extinction and forgetting, it is worth mentioning that all memory phases are regulated by a complex and integrated brain circuit.",
              "Part of which might involve different input/output or modulatory pathways that would alternatively be enhanced [237,238,239].",
              "Plenty of studies have associated shrinkage and elimination of dendritic spines with synaptic LTD [240,241,242].",
              "In detail, an optically-induced LTD provoked a homogeneous lowering of hippocampal synaptic function, followed over days by synaptic refinement, as synapses most likely to release neurotransmitters regained their function over time whereas low-probability ones were removed [208].",
              "On the other hand, repetitive induction of chemical LTD on consecutive days resulted in substantial retraction of mushroom spines, whose subtype is considered the most stable [243].",
              "Additionally, mutant animals lacking the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR, in addition to deficits in learning and LTD expression, had an expressive reduction on dendritic spine density in CA1 neurons [219].",
              "When it comes to memory-related dendritic shrinkage, structural alterations were supposed to engender the synaptic refinement vital for stablishing memory once fear conditioning induced a reduction in spine density specifically in hippocampal neurons that were active during learning, but not in those inactive [244].",
              "Besides, fear conditioning was found to induce spine elimination also in other brain regions such as motor [245] and frontal association cortex [246].",
              "The neurobiology of extinction memory has also been grounded on a complex structural remodeling that involves several brain areas.",
              "Although it is widely accepted that extinction has its foundations built on a new memory, following studies have implied that the original conditioned trace may still be affected by extinction as, in addition to the increase in number, all the structural spine changes of the anterior Cg, IL, BLA and auditory cortex were found reset back to preconditioning levels by extinction [247,248,249].",
              "Overall, spine or dendritic removal/shrinkage underlies functional synaptic weakening during some particular phases of memory, such a scenario that gets more complex when entangled with upward neuroplasticity.",
              "The intracellular measurement of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input ratios establishes the key principle of excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) synaptic balance, a concept which helps to better understand how the neuronal firing rate is sustained within a physiological range and under a neurocircuitry perspective to maintain accurate and reliable any transmission of information.",
              "E/I ratios are kept stable over time despite fluctuating external interferences, and the mechanisms underlying its maintenance are diverse and intricate [250].",
              "Tight coupling with a counterweight is thought to regulate how quickly and accurately neurons can respond to a stimulus, once it would function as gain and selectivity mechanisms so that it might favor output refinement while expanding the operational range necessary to drive neuronal activity [251].",
              "Within the perspective of a single neuron the firing rate is homeostatically regulated by neuronal intrinsic excitability via voltage-dependent inward and outward currents [252], as such adjustment dictates how easily neurons will reach spike threshold [253].",
              "Furthermore, postsynaptic activity dynamically adjusts the induction of plasticity through a sliding threshold between potentiation and depression so that it also happens to modulate subsequent plasticity - i.",
              "e., metaplasticity [254, 255].",
              "When past activity is low, the synaptic threshold slides down and favors LTP induction, conversely higher overall activity slides the threshold up and favors LTD induction [256].",
              "Additionally, it is assumed that homeostatic adjustments in synaptic strength are accompanied by changes in the accumulation of postsynaptic receptors such as NMDAR and AMPAR, characterizing synaptic scaling [257, 258].",
              "All these changes can occur locally, at synaptic sites, or globally throughout the entire dendritic arborization.",
              "An important hallmark of synaptic scaling is that the number of synaptic receptors is modified following a multiplicative scaling factor so that preserves the relative differences between synaptic weights and properly conserves the information stored [259,260,261].",
              "At a spine structural level, competitive interactions between spines are expected to maintain total excitatory inputs constant, within a dynamic range, as increased spine density was followed by decreased spine volume and individual synaptic response [262] and theta burst stimulation-induced LTP increased spine size while decreased overall spine density [263].",
              "Indeed input-specific synaptic potentiation induced with high-frequency glutamatergic uncaging led to structural growth of the local dendritic spine of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, but shrank and weakened nearby unstimulated spines [264].",
              "The same pattern of such heterosynaptic shrinkage of inactive and adjacent spines was witnessed in the principal neurons of the basolateral amygdala [265].",
              "Accordingly, efficacy of spontaneous transmission in both cortical and hippocampal individual synapses was regulated by the extent of nearby synaptic co-activity [266].",
              "Interestingly, activity-driven shrinkage of neighboring spines was limited to 10 \u03bcm radius inter-spine distance and the closest ones had the greatest shrinkage [267].",
              "It is thought that heterosynaptic spine elimination could contribute to the compartmentalization of dendritic segments by clustering synaptic inputs, thus favoring the dendritic branch as a fundamental functional unit able of performing local computations and memory storage [268, 269].",
              "From the standpoint of an entangled brain, this complex set of homeostatic regulatory mechanisms is important for modulating synaptic weights and neuronal activity in order to maintain neuronal network homeostasis at both spatial and temporal scales [259].",
              "Although data on homeostatic plasticity are scarce when not focused to its own neurophysiological mechanisms, to make a better sense of this topic as an extension of our other topics we next describe some studies in which homeostatic plasticity has someway been involved with some aspect related to neurodevelopment, aging, stress and memory.",

              "Since neurodevelopment, homeostatic mechanisms are observed and expressed in particular ways depending on the brain area, cell-type and age investigated.",
              "Also, homeostatic dysregulation may explain some of the aging-related phenomena such as hyperexcitability.",
              "The extent which and location where homeostatic control takes place may be impacted by circuit maturation throughout neural development as in the visual cortex it is triggered by visual experience.",
              "For example, at postnatal day 16 to 21, layers 4 and 6 are under synaptic scaling regulation [270], while on later ages scaling switches to layers 2/3 [271, 272].",
              "Disturbances of activity in the developing network may also be restored to normal levels with inhibitory and/or excitatory adjustments.",
              "Consistently, the density of inhibitory synapses decreased when a glutamate receptor antagonist was applied to the organotypic culture of the developing hippocampus [273].",
              "In addition, homeostatic plasticity may involve specific cell-types as developing hippocampal granule cells exhibited reduced inhibitory input from parvalbumin-positive basket interneurons when excitatory drives were absent [274].",
              "Pyramidal neurons in layer 4 of the visual cortex dynamically adjusted excitatory and inhibitory inputs, respectively, up and down to compensate for the reduction in sensory cues [275].",
              "Based on the central idea that learning induces an increase in neuronal excitability a study observed that the compensatory reduction in hippocampal neuronal excitability, induced with the delivery of a high-frequency spike train specifically to fear engram cells, facilitated memory extinction while decreased the density of dendritic spines and increased the number of inhibitory synapses [276].",
              "Contrary to the idea that neurons with higher excitability are more likely to be recruited for learning while learning itself would increase neuronal excitability [277,278,279], learning-induced hyperexcitability actually happened to rapidly trigger a counteracting force sufficient to decrease neuronal excitability [280].",
              "However, in this case such homeostatic plasticity was suggested to be critical for consolidating memories without interference.",
              "Another study found that synaptic refinement induced by homeostatic downscaling sculpted an accurate associative taste memory after taste aversion conditioning initially induced a generalized response as synapses in the gustatory cortex were potentiated [281].",
              "Homeostatic control might act as a protective physiological mechanism that supports appropriate coping strategy during stressful circumstances by maintaining the dynamics of behavioral and physiological adjustments within an optimal range through a precise E/I neuronal balance [282].",
              "On the other hand, failure of homeostatic controls during stress might favor depression and anxiety-like behaviors [283].",

              "This Ih current was higher than the upregulation usually observed in depressed mice and it drove an excitatory force that was countered by an increase in K+ channel currents, a cell-specific compensatory mechanism that reduced VTA DA excitability to control levels [284].",
              "Accumulating evidence demonstrates that neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperexcitable networks are hallmarks of normal [285, 286] and pathological aging [287].",
              "Also, hyperexcitability in different brain regions as the hippocampus [285, 286, 288] and cortex [289] is associated with cognitive deficits [290, 291].",
              "Many factors may account for hyperexcitability, including dyshomeostasis in Ca2+ [287, 291], alterations of GABAergic [292, 293] or glutamatergic [286] circuitry with effects on the E/I balance, as well as modifications on intrinsic excitability [288, 294].",
              "Hypothetically, these age-associated changes could underlie failures on homeostatic control of excitability and influence neuronal firing rate [295].",
              "Numerous proteins involved in AMPAR stabilization and AMPAR-mediated signaling cascades are down- or upregulate in the whole aging brain [296, 297], a potential mechanism for synaptic scaling and homeostatic control failures.",

              "One could still say that once a synapse is gone, the brain would end up with lower levels of neuronal matter for the next move of neuroplasticity to take place.",
              "Indeed, neurodegenerative disorders make the brain less flexible as brain mass losses become massive over the course of the disease.",
              "So, for these cases it is unavoidable to think of an impairment of neuroplasticity.",
              "The same could be said about brain injury or stroke brain damage.",
              "However, under physiological conditions such as neurodevelopment, healthy aging, stress coping, memory and learning, synaptic turnover is part of a contingency plan to optimize the flow of neural information on demand.",
              "So, considering how complex the brain and its entangled neurocircuitry are, it is not worth compartmentalizing it to refine neuroplasticity concepts based on microniches as any change might be directly or indirectly counteracted at the cellular or neurocircuitry level by a completely opposite direction of neuroplasticity.",
              "While we attempt to reduce the bias related to any moral judgment that could be even loosely associated with disconnection of synapses, we are aware that this approach is just the beginning as a paradigm shift has much more to deal with than handling sub-concepts.",
              "Indeed, any bias depends on the guided experience of a personal life, and therefore the concept of \u201cdownward\u201d or \u201cupward\u201d neuroplasticity might still have some negative or positive connotation.",
              "We then want to make it as clear as possible that the idea of using such sub-concepts comes from the neutral view of direction vectors, an approach that should at least help to minimize any personal moral bias towards neuroplasticity.",
              "As the island of knowledge grows larger, so does its horizon.",
              "The same happens when we include the \u201cupward\u201d and \u201cdownward\u201d concepts to neuroplasticity.",
              "So now more than ever is a great opportunity to update the meaning of neuroplasticity, as our current knowledge that plasticity is an intrinsic and bidirectional property of neurons somewhat blurs the difference between \u201cneuroplasticity\u201d and \u201cneurophysiology\u201d.",
              "Although it sounds more of an epistemological issue, we propose that neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to change itself in such a way that any gain or loss in brain function should be bigger or lower than the sum of its lost or gained parts.",
              "So, brain reorganization itself would not suffice to determine neuroplasticity without an amplified gain or loss of brain function, provided that the initial state of the brain is maintained and there is no change in the specific function of one region that is sufficient to reach and modify other areas of the brain.",
              "Such an updated concept would fit better with the new findings that place any single part of the brain directly or indirectly connected to any other single part of the brain, making even a small change likely to influence the entire brain in some way.",
              "Therefore, upward and downward plasticity should at first be understood as complementary to each other, including in cases of psychiatric disorders.",
              "Both neuroplasticities co-exist, certainly interact with each other and thus one has nothing more especial than the other.",
              "Hence, it is important to give downward neuroplasticity as much attention as upward neuroplasticity given that brain flexibility would not be complete without one or the other.",
              "For good or bad, downward modifications are part of the neuroplasticity program, rather than being a deficiency of it.",
              "For a brief overview of the conclusion, please see Fig.",
              "6.",
              "The main goal of this review is to work on the idea of how neuroplasticity, in all its complexity, should be conceptually understood as a balance between what we have called here as \u201cupward and downward neuroplasticity\u201d.",
              "Developing brains, and partially also the adult ones, are flexible, moldable, and as it is, any capability for decreasing the density levels or structural complexity of spines and/or dendrites should be considered part of the neuroplasticity program, rather than being a deficiency of it.",
              "Thus, comparable to how puzzles fit together, upward and downward neuroplasticity work to complement each other so that the brain would eventually be able to reshape its connections by neuronal tuning to optimize network\u2019s efficiency under certain demands.",
              "Within a broader landscape as seen with assembled puzzles, although neuroplasticity happens at first glance from the microscale changes of spines and dendrites according to a neuronal perspective, its consequences expand toward a macroscale outlook where individual orchestrated changes integrate into the account of different neuronal populations and neurocircuits.",
              "So, any cause or consequence neuroplastic change from an entangled brain, whether up or down, may be directly or indirectly connected to at least some other part of the brain that could still show a completely opposite direction of neuroplasticity.",
              "The orange, red and gray puzzles represent different populations of neurons that in the sum of the events globally present upward plasticity, while the green, yellow and purple puzzles represent different populations of neurons that in the sum of the events present global downward plasticity.",
              "Meanwhile, the blue and white puzzles represent neurons with a balanced number of events that represent both upward and downward neuroplasticity.",
