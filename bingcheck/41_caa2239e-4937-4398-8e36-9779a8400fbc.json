              "[24] During the production of Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio discovered Tim Powers's 1987 novel On Stranger Tides, which they considered a good foundation on which to base \"a new chapter\" in the Pirates series.",
              "[15] Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007.",
              "[25] In 2009, after the announcement of the film's title, which led to speculation in regards to his book, Powers insisted that Jack Sparrow and his book's main character Jack Shandy \"are totally different characters\" but that it was possible that \"they might overlap\" Blackbeard and Barbossa, though felt certain the Fountain of Youth was the only thing they would hold on to due to the film's ending.",

              "So I wouldn't call this an adaptation.\"",
              "[13] Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, \"kind of a James Bond sort of thing\", instead of the \"designed to be a trilogy\" structure of the previous installments.",
              "[27] They hoped to \"design a story that would support new characters,\" knowing that previous arcs were over.",
              "[28] Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to \"streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow\", as the number of characters and subplots in At World's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length.",
              "[15] The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded to in the previous episodes: mermaids,[27] which are briefly referenced as \"suck-you-byes, female demons that weirdly and erotically occupied the last hours of men marooned on barren islands\" in the fourth chapter of the book.",
              "The mermaids' role expanded in the film's script, which included a vast attack sequence.",

              "[27] Among Depp's suggestions were turning Philip into a missionary and having a Spanish contingent following the protagonists.",

              "[33] Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg, as he considered the disability made him \"angrier, more forceful and resilient as a character\", and had to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and usage of crutch, particularly during sword fighting scenes.",
              "[34] While the production team considered a prop pegleg to be put over Rush's leg, the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally, with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk.",

              "[33] According to Marshall, McShane was chosen because \"he can play something evil but there's always humor behind it as well\" and the actor accepted the job due to both the \"very funny and charming\" script and the opportunity to work with Marshall.",
              "[44] The beard took one hour and a half to get applied, and McShane likened the character's costume to \"a real biker pirate\u2014it's all black leather.",

              "[15] Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007.",
              "[25] In 2009, after the announcement of the film's title, which led to speculation in regards to his book, Powers insisted that Jack Sparrow and his book's main character Jack Shandy \"are totally different characters\" but that it was possible that \"they might overlap\" Blackbeard and Barbossa, though felt certain the Fountain of Youth was the only thing they would hold on to due to the film's ending.",

              "So I wouldn't call this an adaptation.\"",
              "[13] Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, \"kind of a James Bond sort of thing\", instead of the \"designed to be a trilogy\" structure of the previous installments.",
              "[27] They hoped to \"design a story that would support new characters,\" knowing that previous arcs were over.",
              "[28] Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to \"streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow\", as the number of characters and subplots in At World's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length.",
              "[15] The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded to in the previous episodes: mermaids,[27] which are briefly referenced as \"suck-you-byes, female demons that weirdly and erotically occupied the last hours of men marooned on barren islands\" in the fourth chapter of the book.",
              "The mermaids' role expanded in the film's script, which included a vast attack sequence.",
              "[28] Depp was deeply involved with the story design, frequently meeting the writers to show what he was interested in doing, and in the words of Rossio, being \"involved in coming up with storylines, connecting characters, creating moments that we would then fashion, shape and then go back.\"",
              "[27] Among Depp's suggestions were turning Philip into a missionary and having a Spanish contingent following the protagonists.",
              "[29] Afterwards, Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca met Rossio and Elliot and did alterations of their own, including building the female lead.",
              "[28] Depp signed on to return as Captain Jack Sparrow in September 2008, saying that he would come back if the script was good.",

              "[33] Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg, as he considered the disability made him \"angrier, more forceful and resilient as a character\", and had to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and usage of crutch, particularly during sword fighting scenes.",
              "[34] While the production team considered a prop pegleg to be put over Rush's leg, the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally, with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk.",

              "[43] New cast members include Ian McShane, who plays the notorious pirate and primary antagonist of the film, Blackbeard, and Pene\u0301lope Cruz, who plays Angelica, Jack Sparrow's love interest.",
              "[33] According to Marshall, McShane was chosen because \"he can play something evil but there's always humor behind it as well\" and the actor accepted the job due to both the \"very funny and charming\" script and the opportunity to work with Marshall.",
              "[44] The beard took one hour and a half to get applied, and McShane likened the character's costume to \"a real biker pirate\u2014it's all black leather.",
              "\u201d[45] Marshall said Cruz was the only actress considered for the role, as she fit the description as \"an actress who could not only go toe to toe with Johnny and match him, but also needed to be all the things that Jack Sparrow is in a way.",

              "[64] The tighter schedule\u2014according to Bruckheimer, \"We had a 22-week post, and for a picture like this, with almost 1,200 visual effects shots, it's usually 40 weeks\"\u2014meant that Marshall supervised editing of sequences during filming.",

              "In the age of big event blockbusters like Avengers: Endgame and the Star Wars sequel trilogy, it's no surprise that the most expensive movie ever made is an entry in a major Disney franchise.",
              "What might come as more of a shock, however, is the fact that that record is held by Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.",
              "The fourth entry in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is generally not held in the same high regard as its three predecessors, let alone behemoths like the Avengers film, yet its production budget -- whether adjusted for inflation or not -- surpasses that of any other film ever made.",
              "It's not hard to see why Disney would be willing to dedicate so much budget to a fourth Pirates movie;",
              "the first three had enjoyed huge success with audiences and had established a pattern of growing in scale with each installment.",
              "However, the fourth film seemed to buck the trend of the franchise's constantly expanding ambitions, shedding much of the central cast and abandoning the colossal battles at sea seen in the climaxes of the previous films. With that said, let's look at how the film cost more than not just its predecessors, but every other film ever made.",
              "RELATED: Cruella Sneaks in a Silly Pirates of the Caribbean Homage On Stranger Tides boasted a whopping $379 million production budget -- and that's after a tax credit the production received for shooting in the United Kingdom, with the film's total cost coming to over $410 million.",
              "As surprising as this may be to fans, it was perhaps just as unexpected for Disney, who had originally envisioned the film having a smaller budget than its predecessors.",
              "On Stranger Tides was shot on a tighter schedule than others in the series, included fewer visual effects shots and production was moved to the UK and Hawaii to take advantage of the tax benefits for films shot there.",
              "Despite this, Disney had allowed for a heftier price tag in the budget, and several factors ultimately pushed the film to its record-breaking cost.",
              "Cast and crew costs were one of the biggest driving forces behind the film's impressive budget.",
              "A total of 895 production staff were hired, and, while stars of previous Pirates of the Caribbean films like Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were notably absent from this installment, the film added Pene\u0301lope Cruz and Ian McShane to its cast, alongside the returning Johnny Depp.",
              "With On Stranger Tides being his fourth outing as Captain Jack Sparrow, Depp was able to secure a sizeable paycheck, reportedly earning $55 million from the film (though it should be noted some of this will have likely come from box office earnings, rather than Depp's budgeted salary).",
              "RELATED: A Disney/Time Warner Merger Nearly Happened in 2016 The film was also the first in the franchise to be shot almost entirely on 3D cameras, utilizing an improved model of the cameras used on 2009's 3D epic, Avatar.",
              "Shooting in 3D, rather than converting the film to it in post-production, is a more complex and costly process than standard shooting.",
              "Furthermore, the logistics of shooting at sea often drive up the cost of any film.",
              "While Disney had tried to minimize the number of scenes shot at sea for budgetary reasons, this was always going to be a factor for a film called On Stranger Tides.",
              "While it might not be many people's first guess for the most expensive movie ever made, the demands and ambition of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides ultimately drove Disney to dedicate more money to the production than anything else they -- or anyone -- had worked on before.",
              "Ultimately, the investment paid off, as the film grossed $1.",
              "045 billion worldwide.",
              "After turning that sort of profit on the biggest budget ever committed to a single film, it's no surprise Disney is planning to keep the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise going.",

              "[15] On July 21, 2009, Marshall accepted the job, because of the \"whole new story line and set of characters.",

              "[13] Marshall's involvement wasn't reported until August.",

              "[21] Depp also explained Cook was one of the few who accepted his portrayal of Jack Sparrow: \"When things went a little sideways on the first Pirates movie and others at the studio were less than enthusiastic about my interpretation of the character, Dick was there from the first moment.",
              "He trusted me\".",

              "[23] Pintel and Ragetti were originally supposed to make an appearance, but director Rob Marshall opted out of the idea as he feared their roles would be cut.",
              "[24] During the production of Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio discovered Tim Powers's 1987 novel On Stranger Tides, which they considered a good foundation on which to base \"a new chapter\" in the Pirates series.",
              "[15] Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007.",
              "[25] In 2009, after the announcement of the film's title, which led to speculation in regards to his book, Powers insisted that Jack Sparrow and his book's main character Jack Shandy \"are totally different characters\" but that it was possible that \"they might overlap\" Blackbeard and Barbossa, though felt certain the Fountain of Youth was the only thing they would hold on to due to the film's ending.",
              "[26] Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book, \"but whenever you say those words, Powers's novel comes to mind.",
              "There was no way we could work in that field without going into territory Tim had explored.\"",

              "But Jack Sparrow is not in the book, nor is Barbossa.",
              "So I wouldn't call this an adaptation.\"",
              "[13] Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, \"kind of a James Bond sort of thing\", instead of the \"designed to be a trilogy\" structure of the previous installments.",
              "[27] They hoped to \"design a story that would support new characters,\" knowing that previous arcs were over.",
              "[28] Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to \"streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow\", as the number of characters and subplots in At World's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length.",
              "[15] The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded to in the previous episodes: mermaids,[27] which are briefly referenced as \"suck-you-byes, female demons that weirdly and erotically occupied the last hours of men marooned on barren islands\" in the fourth chapter of the book.",
              "The mermaids' role expanded in the film's script, which included a vast attack sequence.",
              "[28] Depp was deeply involved with the story design, frequently meeting the writers to show what he was interested in doing, and in the words of Rossio, being \"involved in coming up with storylines, connecting characters, creating moments that we would then fashion, shape and then go back.\"",
              "[27] Among Depp's suggestions were turning Philip into a missionary and having a Spanish contingent following the protagonists.",
              "[29] Afterwards, Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca met Rossio and Elliot and did alterations of their own, including building the female lead.",
              "[28] Depp signed on to return as Captain Jack Sparrow in September 2008, saying that he would come back if the script was good.",
              "[30] Almost a year later, Disney announced that Depp would be paid $55.",
              "5 million for his role, realizing that without him the franchise would be \"dead and buried.\"",
              "[31] Geoffrey Rush expressed interest in returning to his role as Barbossa,[32] and Bruckheimer later confirmed his presence.",
              "[33] Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg, as he considered the disability made him \"angrier, more forceful and resilient as a character\", and had to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and usage of crutch, particularly during sword fighting scenes.",
              "[34] While the production team considered a prop pegleg to be put over Rush's leg, the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally, with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk.",
              "[9] Three other actors from the previous films returned, Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs,[35] Greg Ellis as Lt.",

              "[37] Previous cast members Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) and Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann) stated that they would not reprise their roles, as they wanted to be involved in different films. They both thought the storyline involving their characters had gone as far as it could.",
              "[38][39][40] On August 1, 2009, Bill Nighy expressed his desire to return as Davy Jones, who died in the previous film, citing a possibility to resurrect the character, but at the end, his inclusion was scrapped.",
              "[41][42] On February 5, 2010, Mackenzie Crook also announced he would not be reprising his role of Ragetti, stating, \"They haven't asked me.",
              "But actually I don't mind that at all.",
              "I'm a fan of the first one especially and I think the trilogy we've made is great.",
              "I'd almost like them to leave it there.\"",
              "[43] New cast members include Ian McShane, who plays the notorious pirate and primary antagonist of the film, Blackbeard, and Pene\u0301lope Cruz, who plays Angelica, Jack Sparrow's love interest.",
              "[33] According to Marshall, McShane was chosen because \"he can play something evil but there's always humor behind it as well\" and the actor accepted the job due to both the \"very funny and charming\" script and the opportunity to work with Marshall.",
              "[44] The beard took one hour and a half to get applied, and McShane likened the character's costume to \"a real biker pirate\u2014it's all black leather.",
              "\u201d[45] Marshall said Cruz was the only actress considered for the role, as she fit the description as \"an actress who could not only go toe to toe with Johnny and match him, but also needed to be all the things that Jack Sparrow is in a way.",
              "She needed to be funny and clever and smart and crafty and beautiful\",[17] and invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of Nine.",
              "[9] The actress spent two months working out and learning fencing for the role.",
              "[46] Cruz was pregnant during filming, leading the costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic and the producers to hire her sister Mo\u0301nica Cruz to double for Pene\u0301lope in risky scenes.",
              "[9] Depp recommended Stephen Graham, who worked with him in Public Enemies, to play Scrum, a Machiavellian pirate and sidekick to Jack Sparrow,[47][48] and Richard Griffiths for the role of King George II, as Depp was a fan of Griffiths' work on Withnail and I.",
              "[9] Sam Claflin, a recent drama school graduate with television experience, was chosen to play the missionary Philip,[49] and British actor Paul Bazely also joined the cast.",

              "[54] The rest of the mermaid portrayers, such as Australian supermodel Gemma Ward,[55] were chosen for having \"exotic sense, an otherworldly sensibility, but also under those layers a deadly quality\", according to Marshall, and had to take swimming lessons to learn movements such as the dolphin and eggbeater kicks.",

              "So I wouldn't call this an adaptation.\"",
              "[13] Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, \"kind of a James Bond sort of thing\", instead of the \"designed to be a trilogy\" structure of the previous installments.",
              "[27] They hoped to \"design a story that would support new characters,\" knowing that previous arcs were over.",
              "[28] Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to \"streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow\", as the number of characters and subplots in At World's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length.",
              "[15] The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded to in the previous episodes: mermaids,[27] which are briefly referenced as \"suck-you-byes, female demons that weirdly and erotically occupied the last hours of men marooned on barren islands\" in the fourth chapter of the book.",
              "The mermaids' role expanded in the film's script, which included a vast attack sequence.",
              "[28] Depp was deeply involved with the story design, frequently meeting the writers to show what he was interested in doing, and in the words of Rossio, being \"involved in coming up with storylines, connecting characters, creating moments that we would then fashion, shape and then go back.\"",
              "[27] Among Depp's suggestions were turning Philip into a missionary and having a Spanish contingent following the protagonists.",
              "[29] Afterwards, Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca met Rossio and Elliot and did alterations of their own, including building the female lead.",
              "[28] Depp signed on to return as Captain Jack Sparrow in September 2008, saying that he would come back if the script was good.",

              "[31] Geoffrey Rush expressed interest in returning to his role as Barbossa,[32] and Bruckheimer later confirmed his presence.",
              "[33] Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg, as he considered the disability made him \"angrier, more forceful and resilient as a character\", and had to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and usage of crutch, particularly during sword fighting scenes.",
              "[34] While the production team considered a prop pegleg to be put over Rush's leg, the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally, with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk.",

              "[33] According to Marshall, McShane was chosen because \"he can play something evil but there's always humor behind it as well\" and the actor accepted the job due to both the \"very funny and charming\" script and the opportunity to work with Marshall.",
              "[44] The beard took one hour and a half to get applied, and McShane likened the character's costume to \"a real biker pirate\u2014it's all black leather.",
              "\u201d[45] Marshall said Cruz was the only actress considered for the role, as she fit the description as \"an actress who could not only go toe to toe with Johnny and match him, but also needed to be all the things that Jack Sparrow is in a way.",
              "She needed to be funny and clever and smart and crafty and beautiful\",[17] and invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of Nine.",

              "[54] The rest of the mermaid portrayers, such as Australian supermodel Gemma Ward,[55] were chosen for having \"exotic sense, an otherworldly sensibility, but also under those layers a deadly quality\", according to Marshall, and had to take swimming lessons to learn movements such as the dolphin and eggbeater kicks.",

              "[64] The tighter schedule\u2014according to Bruckheimer, \"We had a 22-week post, and for a picture like this, with almost 1,200 visual effects shots, it's usually 40 weeks\"\u2014meant that Marshall supervised editing of sequences during filming.",

              "Only one sequence was shot conventionally and needed a 3D conversion.",
              "[15] The cameras were improved versions of the ones James Cameron developed for Avatar, which were made more compact for extra mobility.",
              "This meant the cameras could be brought into locations such as the Hawaiian jungle.",

              "Given Blackbeard was meant to be the meanest pirate to appear in the series, the look for Queen Anne's Revenge was ominous, with sails dyed blood red, various elements on fire, and a decoration based on skulls and bones (drawing inspiration from the Sedlec Ossuary in Czech Republic).",

              "[66] The replica ship HMS Surprise was used for Barbossa's ship, HMS Providence,[67] and all the scenes aboard Providence were shot on the Long Beach shore as Surprise could not be sailed to Hawaii.",

              "[72] ILM also handled Blackbeard's death, where Ian McShane's actual performance was covered by digital doubles which turned him into a \"boiling mass of blood and clothing\", and a hurricane-like formation that represented \"the waters of the Fountain taking his life\".",

              "[15] Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007.",
              "[25] In 2009, after the announcement of the film's title, which led to speculation in regards to his book, Powers insisted that Jack Sparrow and his book's main character Jack Shandy \"are totally different characters\" but that it was possible that \"they might overlap\" Blackbeard and Barbossa, though felt certain the Fountain of Youth was the only thing they would hold on to due to the film's ending.",

              "So I wouldn't call this an adaptation.\"",
              "[13] Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, \"kind of a James Bond sort of thing\", instead of the \"designed to be a trilogy\" structure of the previous installments.",

              "[28] Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to \"streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow\", as the number of characters and subplots in At World's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length.",
              "[15] The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded to in the previous episodes: mermaids,[27] which are briefly referenced as \"suck-you-byes, female demons that weirdly and erotically occupied the last hours of men marooned on barren islands\" in the fourth chapter of the book.",
              "The mermaids' role expanded in the film's script, which included a vast attack sequence.",
              "[28] Depp was deeply involved with the story design, frequently meeting the writers to show what he was interested in doing, and in the words of Rossio, being \"involved in coming up with storylines, connecting characters, creating moments that we would then fashion, shape and then go back.\"",
              "[27] Among Depp's suggestions were turning Philip into a missionary and having a Spanish contingent following the protagonists.",

              "[33] Rush was positive on Barbossa having lost a leg, as he considered the disability made him \"angrier, more forceful and resilient as a character\", and had to work with the stunt team for an accurate portrayal of the limp and usage of crutch, particularly during sword fighting scenes.",
              "[34] While the production team considered a prop pegleg to be put over Rush's leg, the tight schedule caused it to be replaced with a blue sock that was replaced digitally, with a knob on the shoe to give Rush a reference for his walk.",

              "[43] New cast members include Ian McShane, who plays the notorious pirate and primary antagonist of the film, Blackbeard, and Pene\u0301lope Cruz, who plays Angelica, Jack Sparrow's love interest.",
              "[33] According to Marshall, McShane was chosen because \"he can play something evil but there's always humor behind it as well\" and the actor accepted the job due to both the \"very funny and charming\" script and the opportunity to work with Marshall.",
              "[44] The beard took one hour and a half to get applied, and McShane likened the character's costume to \"a real biker pirate\u2014it's all black leather.",
              "\u201d[45] Marshall said Cruz was the only actress considered for the role, as she fit the description as \"an actress who could not only go toe to toe with Johnny and match him, but also needed to be all the things that Jack Sparrow is in a way.",
              "She needed to be funny and clever and smart and crafty and beautiful\",[17] and invited her for the role as they wrapped the production of Nine.",

              "[46] Cruz was pregnant during filming, leading the costume department to redesign her wardrobe to be more elastic and the producers to hire her sister Mo\u0301nica Cruz to double for Pene\u0301lope in risky scenes.",
              "[9] Depp recommended Stephen Graham, who worked with him in Public Enemies, to play Scrum, a Machiavellian pirate and sidekick to Jack Sparrow,[47][48] and Richard Griffiths for the role of King George II, as Depp was a fan of Griffiths' work on Withnail and I.",

              "[64] The tighter schedule\u2014according to Bruckheimer, \"We had a 22-week post, and for a picture like this, with almost 1,200 visual effects shots, it's usually 40 weeks\"\u2014meant that Marshall supervised editing of sequences during filming.",

              "Only one sequence was shot conventionally and needed a 3D conversion.",
              "[15] The cameras were improved versions of the ones James Cameron developed for Avatar, which were made more compact for extra mobility.",

              "Given Blackbeard was meant to be the meanest pirate to appear in the series, the look for Queen Anne's Revenge was ominous, with sails dyed blood red, various elements on fire, and a decoration based on skulls and bones (drawing inspiration from the Sedlec Ossuary in Czech Republic).",
