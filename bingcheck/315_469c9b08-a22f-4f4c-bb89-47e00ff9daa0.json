    "response": "Corroboree is a term that refers to an Aboriginal dance ritual, often involving costumes and music[^2^]. The word was originally derived from the Indigenous word 'caribberie', but was mispronounced by British colonisers[^3^]. Corroboree is more than just a performance; it is a way of celebrating Aboriginal mythology and spirituality[^2^].\n\nCorroboree has a long history and a deep cultural significance for Aboriginal people. It is a way of passing on stories, traditions, laws and customs from generation to generation. Corroboree also serves as a way of connecting with the land, the ancestors and the creator spirits[^3^].\n\nCorroboree has evolved over time to adapt to changing circumstances and influences. For example, some corroborees have incorporated elements of Christian hymns, European instruments or contemporary issues[^3^]. Some corroborees have also been created to raise awareness and promote conservation of endangered species, such as the northern corroboree frog[^1^].\n\nCorroboree is still a revered aspect of Aboriginal culture and identity today. It is a way of expressing pride, resilience, creativity and diversity. It is also a way of sharing Aboriginal culture with non-Indigenous audiences and fostering mutual respect and understanding[^3^].",

              "Antiphonal psalmody is the singing or musical playing of psalms by alternating groups of performers.",
              "The peculiar mirror structure of the Hebrew psalms makes it likely that the antiphonal method originated in the services of the ancient Israelites.",
              "According to the historian Socrates of Constantinople, its introduction into Christian worship was due to Ignatius of Antioch (died 107), who in a vision had seen the angels singing in alternate choirs.",
              "[3] During the first two or three centuries, Christian communities incorporated into their observances features of Greek music and the music of other cultures bordering on the eastern Mediterranean Sea.",
              "[4] As the early Church spread from Jerusalem to Asia Minor, North Africa, and Europe, it absorbed other musical influences.",
              "For example, the monasteries and churches of Syria were important in the development of psalm singing and the use of strophic devotional song, or hymns.",

              "[6] Evidence of musical roles during the 6th through 7th centuries is particularly sparse because of the cycle of invasions of Germanic tribes in the West and doctrinal and political conflict in the East as well as the consequent instability of Christian institutions in the former Roman empire.",

              "Singing psalms made up a large part of the life in a monastic community, while a smaller group and soloists sang the chants.",
              "In its long history, Gregorian Chant has been subjected to many gradual changes and some reforms. It was organized, codified, and notated mainly in the Frankish lands of western and central Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, with later additions and redactions, but the texts and many of the melodies have antecedents going back several centuries earlier.",
              "Although a 9th-century legend credits Pope Gregory the Great with having personally invented Gregorian chant by receiving the chant melodies through divine intervention of the Holy Spirit,[8] scholars now believe that the chant bearing his name arose from a later Carolingian synthesis of Roman and Gallican chant.",
              "During the following centuries, the Chant tradition was still at the heart of Church music, where it changed and acquired various accretions.",
              "Even the polyphonic music that arose from the venerable old chants in the Organa by Le\u0301onin and Pe\u0301rotin in Paris (1160\u20131240) ended in monophonic chant and in later traditions new composition styles were practiced in juxtaposition (or co-habitation) with monophonic chant.",
              "This practice continued into the lifetime of Franc\u0327ois Couperin, whose Organ Masses were meant to be performed with alternating homophonic Chant.",
              "Although it had mostly fallen into disuse after the Baroque period, Chant experienced a revival in the 19th century in the Catholic Church and the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Anglican Communion.",

              "Most masses are settings of the liturgy in Latin, the traditional language of the Catholic Church, but there are a significant number written in the languages of non-Catholic countries where vernacular worship has long been the norm.",
              "For example, there are many masses (often called \"Communion Services\") written in English for the Church of England.",

              "Many masses, especially later ones, were never intended to be performed during the celebration of an actual mass.",
              "Generally, for a composition to be a full mass, it must contain the following invariable five sections, which together constitute the Ordinary of the Mass.",
              "This setting of the Ordinary of the Mass spawned a tradition of Mass composition to which many famous composers of the standard concert repertory made contributions, including Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.",

              "In a liturgical mass, there are variable other sections that may be sung, often in Gregorian chant.",
              "These sections, the \"proper\" of the mass, change with the day and season according to the church calendar, or according to the special circumstances of the mass.",
              "The proper of the mass is usually not set to music in a mass itself, except in the case of a Requiem Mass, but may be the subject of motets or other musical compositions.",
              "The sections of the proper of the mass include the introit, gradual, Alleluia or Tract (depending on the time of year), offertory and communion.",

              "Today the carol is represented almost exclusively by the Christmas carol, the Advent carol, and to a lesser extent by the Easter carol.",
              "The tradition of Christmas carols goes back as far as the 13th century, although carols were originally communal songs sung during celebrations like harvest tide as well as Christmas.",
              "It was only in the late 18th and 19th centuries that carols began to be sung in church, and to be specifically associated with Christmas.",
              "Traditionally, carols have often been based on medieval chord progressions, and it is this that gives them their characteristic sound.",
              "Some carols like \"Personent hodie\" and \"Angels from the Realms of Glory\" can be traced directly back to the Middle Ages, and are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung.",
              "Carols suffered a decline in popularity after the Reformation in the countries where Protestant churches gained prominence (although well-known Reformers like Martin Luther authored carols and encouraged their use in worship), but survived in rural communities until the revival of interest in carols in the 19th century.",
              "The first appearance in print of \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\", \"The First Noel\", \"I Saw Three Ships\" and \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\" was in Christmas Carols Ancient and Modern (1833) by William Sandys.",
              "Composers like Arthur Sullivan helped to repopularize the carol, and it is this period that gave rise to such favorites as \"Good King Wenceslas\" and \"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\", a New England carol written by Edmund H.",

              "One approach, the regulative principle of worship, favored by many Zwinglians, Calvinists among others, considered anything that was not directly authorized by the Bible to be a novel and Catholic introduction to worship, which was to be rejected.",
              "All hymns that were not direct quotations from the Bible fell into this category.",
              "Such hymns were banned, along with any form of instrumental musical accompaniment, and organs were ripped out of churches.",
              "Instead of hymns, Biblical psalms were chanted, most often without accompaniment.",

              "Their recommendations fall short on most of the studies that emphasize the need for programs that promote cultural connection, enhance cultural identity, links with Elders, ancestry, and connection with Country.",
              "The aim of this scoping review was to incorporate Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing to produce authentic insights and more culturally inclusive understandings of resilience than has previously been achieved.",
              "This review allowed us to push to extend beyond the dominant, non-Indigenous definitions of resilience to better understand resilience from the perspective of Indigenous Peoples of Australia.",
              "Using a decolonizing approach, the literature review revealed a different narrative from our initial attempt at the review.",
              "If we had not persisted in our quest to truly understand resilience from an Indigenous perspective, we would have continued the same narrative to previous reviews that ignored the possibility of a different perspective on resilience.",

              "Importantly, the results we gathered allowed our work to expand beyond the individual and their ability to cope with adversity to acknowledge wider viewpoints encompassing family, culture and community, that more closely reflect Indigenous perspectives and understandings of resilience (34).",
              "To articulate this perspective, Kickett (19) argues the notion of resilience must be made explicit, focusing on the individual, accessing land, family and culture and developing their identity, moving toward agency, determination and spirit, to not just survive, but thrive (19).",
              "Particularly, thriving in the face of adversity such as the impacts of colonialism and racism, to focus attention toward the importance of culture, strength and belonging.",
              "The review supports previous findings that show the links between adversity and resilience and affirm the determination of communities (as a collective) that draw on their cultural knowledge and traditions to transform their situations in order to \u201cthrive not just survive\u201d (19).",
              "Importantly, in many of the review studies adversity was linked to the enduring legacies of colonization, continuous and cumulative transgenerational grief and loss, structural inequities, and racism and discrimination (16, 18, 19).",
              "The studies confirm that these external factors of adversity are unique to Aboriginal populations, as are the protective factors that entail strengthening connection to culture (including language reclamation), community, ancestry and land (including management and economic development) which contribute to individual and collective resilience.",
              "These findings go further than focusing on individual coping and personal development to promote resilience previously discussed in the literature.",
              "They suggest that Indigenous community resilience is strengthened through the collective experience of adversity, such as transgenerational grief and loss, and the resulting support structures and shared resources that are developed and maintained through cultural practices to \u201cstrengthen the bonds and mutual reciprocity\u201d to participate in transformative strategies to address adversity.",
              "Several studies suggest that reframing resilience to embrace Indigenous perspectives has the potential to promote well-being in Indigenous communities across Australia.",
              "As with all research, this review has some limitations.",
              "A limitation of this review is that this review was limited to peer review, published articles and we acknowledge that Indigenous authors are under-represented in the literature, perhaps because of publication bias and the continued challenges faced by Indigenous researchers in Australia.",
              "Further, we acknowledge that Indigenous peoples have other forms of disseminating information including the spoken word, storytelling, art and other important knowledge sharing methods.",
              "We did not capture evidence disseminated in these ways.",
              "Furthermore, in this paper, we attempted to draw together unifying concepts, however, we acknowledge that these may not reflect the needs of the extremely diverse Indigenous populations across Australia.",

          "1. Most studies emphasized the need for strategies to strengthen individual or community connection to culture to foster resilience.",
          "2. Importantly, many studies confirm adversity is linked to the enduring legacies of colonization, continuous and cumulative transgenerational grief and loss, structural inequities, racism, and discrimination.",
          "3. These external factors of adversity are unique to Aboriginal populations, as are the protective factors that entail strengthening connection to culture (including language reclamation), community, ancestry and land (including management and economic development) which contribute to individual and collective resilience.",
          "4. These findings suggest that Aboriginal community resilience is strengthened through the collective experience of adversity, such as transgenerational grief and loss, and the resulting support structures and shared resources that are developed and maintained through cultural practices to strengthen the bonds and mutual reciprocity to participate in transformative strategies to address adversity.",
          "5. This review highlights that strategies such as building on community strengths, capacities, and resources is critical when strengthening resilience within Indigenous communities across Australia.",

While Silas Roberts, the first chairman of the Northern Land Council said \u2018when deprived of their Land, our people are like Christians without souls, wandering aimlessly, people without a purpose\u2019 [2]; Auntie Jean Carter, Community Elder, states, \u2018We\u2019re not disposed people. We still walk this land. We still are the owners of this land\u2019 [3].",

Aboriginality is not a question of skin colour\u2014it is about our cultural connection to our communities and our history, a history that is alive and thriving\u2019. Abigail Burchill, President Tarwirri Indigenous Law Students and Lawyers Association ([45], p. 4)",
          "6. According to Stuurman [8] . . . We have learned that institutionalized violence is carried out in many ways. You don\u2019t need a gun to kill a man: all you have to do is deny him his self-respect and over a period of years you will kill him, you mentally castrate him. The only way to counteract this thing, this slow death, is to enthuse in Blacks, very aggressively, a sense of Aboriginality, self-awareness, a cultural and personal identity as a part of a national group, as an Aboriginal society.",
          "7. While Everett [9] explains that, being Aboriginal is based on spiritual-cultural beliefs which are connected to the worldly universe, and can be defined as follows: \u2018We can see Aboriginality as a philosophical set of rules that are manifested in customary cultural practices which are set within a belief in the Great Spirit which comprises our Spiritual All. Aboriginality is the recognition by peoples that they are citizens of the worldly universe. The Earth is what nurtures us all - flora, fauna, rocks, water and air - and humans."

For Aboriginal communities, being there is all important, and the \u201cdoing\u201d is in relationship building; but, for some non-Aboriginal people, this can appear to be time wasting or indulgent and unlikely to fit into a non-Aboriginal framework of targets and outcomes.",
