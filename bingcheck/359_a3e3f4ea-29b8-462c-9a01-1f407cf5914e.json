    "query": "Can you explain the science behind the recent breakthrough in mRNA technology, and how it has revolutionized the development and efficacy of vaccines and treatments for diseases such as COVID-19?",
    "response": "Sure, I can try to explain the science behind the recent breakthrough in mRNA technology. mRNA stands for **messenger ribonucleic acid**, which is a molecule that carries genetic instructions from DNA to the protein-making machinery of cells[^1^]. mRNA vaccines use synthetic mRNA that encodes a specific protein from a pathogen, such as the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19[^4^]. When injected into the body, the mRNA is taken up by cells and translated into proteins, which then trigger an immune response that protects against future infection[^4^].\n\nThe breakthrough in mRNA technology was not sudden, but rather the result of decades of research and innovation by hundreds of scientists around the world[^1^] [^2^]. Some of the key challenges that had to be overcome were:\n\n- How to deliver mRNA into cells without being degraded by enzymes in the body[^1^] [^2^]. The solution was to use **lipid nanoparticles**, which are tiny fatty droplets that wrap around the mRNA and help it enter the cells[^2^].\n- How to modify mRNA to make it more stable and less likely to cause inflammation or unwanted immune reactions[^1^] [^4^]. The solution was to use **chemically modified nucleotides**, which are the building blocks of RNA, and to optimize the sequence and structure of the mRNA[^4^].\n- How to scale up mRNA production and quality control to meet the demand for vaccines and treatments[^1^] [^4^]. The solution was to use **cell-free transcription systems**, which are biochemical reactions that can synthesize large amounts of mRNA without using living cells[^4^].\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic provided an unprecedented opportunity and urgency for mRNA technology to prove its potential and efficacy. The first mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 were developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna in record time, thanks to prior research on similar coronaviruses and collaborations with regulatory agencies and manufacturing partners[^1^] [^4^]. The mRNA vaccines have shown remarkable safety and effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 infection and severe disease, with more than 90% efficacy in clinical trials and real-world settings[^1^] [^4^].\n\nThe success of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 has opened up new possibilities for using this technology to combat other diseases, such as influenza, HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, cancer and more[^2^] [^4^]. Researchers are also exploring ways to improve mRNA delivery, stability, immunogenicity and scalability, as well as to create novel applications such as gene editing, gene therapy and personalized medicine[^4^].\n\nIn summary, mRNA technology is a revolutionary breakthrough in vaccinology that has been made possible by decades of scientific discovery and innovation. It has demonstrated its power and promise in fighting COVID-19 and has paved the way for a new era of medicine.",

              "The 5\u2032 cap structure, like that of natural eukaryotic mRNAs, contains a 7-methylguanosine nucleoside linked through a triphosphate bridge to the 5\u2032 end of mRNA10.",
              "As in mammals, the first or second nucleotide from the 5\u2032 end is methylated on the 2\u2032 hydroxyl of the ribose (2\u2032-O-methylation), which prevents recognition by cytosolic sensors of viral RNA10, and hence prevents unintended immune responses.",
              "Further, the 5\u2032 cap protects the mRNA sterically from degradation by exonucleases, and it works synergistically with the poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032 end, poly(A) binding proteins and translation initiation factor proteins to circularize mRNA and recruit ribosomes for initiating translation10,11.",
              "The length of the poly(A) tail indirectly regulates both mRNA translation and half-life.",
              "A sufficiently long tail (100\u2013150 bp) is necessary to interact with poly(A) binding proteins that form complexes necessary for initiating translation11,12 and protecting the cap from degradation by decapping enzymes13.",
              "The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs flanking the coding region regulate mRNA translation, half-life and subcellular localization10,14.",
              "Naturally occurring UTRs from highly expressed genes, such as the \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin genes, are preferred for synthetic mRNAs15.",
              "However, because UTR performance can vary by cell type, alternative UTR sequences may be used that have been optimized for the desired application and intended cell target16,17,18.",
              "These engineered UTR sequences minimize mRNA degradation by excluding miRNA-binding sites11 and AU-rich regions in the 3\u2032 UTR19.",
              "Furthermore, they minimize regions that prevent ribosomes from scanning the mRNA transcript, such as sequences with secondary and tertiary structure (for example, hairpins) in the 5\u2032 UTR20.",
              "The open reading frame of the mRNA vaccine is the most crucial component because it contains the coding sequence that is translated into protein.",
              "Although the open reading frame is not as malleable as the non-coding regions, it can be optimized to increase translation without altering the protein sequence by replacing rarely used codons with more frequently occurring codons that encode the same amino acid residue.",
              "For instance, the biopharmaceutical company CureVac AG discovered that human mRNA codons rarely have A or U at the third position and patented a strategy that replaces A or U at the third position in the open reading frame with G or C21.",
              "CureVac used this optimization strategy for its SARS-CoV-2 candidate CVnCoV, which is now in phase III trials (see the mRNA sequence in Related links).",
              "Although replacement of rare codons is an attractive optimization strategy, it must be used judiciously.",
              "This is because, in the case of some proteins, the slower translation rate of rare codons is necessary for proper protein folding22.",
              "To maximize translation, the mRNA sequence typically incorporates modified nucleosides, such as pseudouridine, N1-methylpseudouridine or other nucleoside analogues23.",
              "Because all native mRNAs include modified nucleosides, the immune system has evolved to recognize unmodified single-stranded RNA, which is a hallmark of viral infection.",
              "Specifically, unmodified mRNA is recognized by pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7 and TLR8, and the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIGI) receptor.",
              "TLR7 and TLR8 receptors bind to guanosine- or uridine-rich regions in mRNA and trigger the production of type I interferons, such as IFN\u03b1, that can block mRNA translation24.",
              "The use of modified nucleosides, particularly modified uridine, prevents recognition by pattern recognition receptors, enabling sufficient levels of translation to produce prophylactic amounts of protein5.",
              "Both the Moderna and Pfizer\u2013BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, which produced >94% efficacy in phase III clinical trials25, contain nucleoside-modified mRNAs.",
              "Another strategy to avoid detection by pattern recognition receptors, pioneered by CureVac, uses sequence engineering and codon optimization to deplete uridines by boosting the GC content of the vaccine mRNA26.",
              "In addition to improvements to the mRNA sequence, significant advances have also been made to streamline mRNA production.",
              "Clinically used synthetic mRNA is transcribed in vitro from a DNA plasmid by using the bacteriophage RNA polymerase T7 (T3 and SP6 polymerases can also be used).",
              "It is co-transcriptionally capped (CleanCap, developed by TriLink BioTechnologies) with a 2\u2032-O-methylated cap27,28 and purified to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) contaminants, reactants and incomplete transcripts.",
              "Other methods add the cap with a post-transcriptional reaction using capping and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase enzymes derived from the vaccinia virus.",
              "The poly(A) tail is encoded in the DNA template, which eliminates reaction steps and reduces overall production time and material loss29.",
              "Incorporating the poly(A) tail in the DNA plasmid also overcomes the tail length variability that arises from enzymatic polyadenylation using poly(A) polymerase.",
              "Poly(A) tails of >100 bp are optimal for therapeutic mRNAs;",
              "however, the DNA sequences that encode these long poly(A) stretches can destabilize the DNA plasmids used for transcription.",
              "A solution to overcome this stability issue is to include a short UGC linker in the poly(A) tail30,31.",
              "The Pfizer\u2013BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 uses this strategy and contains a 10 bp UGC linker to produce the sequence A30(10 bp UGC linker)A70 (see the mRNA sequence in Related links).",
              "Together, these innovations have overcome significant manufacturing bottlenecks and facilitated the development of a simple, cost-effective and scalable one-step mRNA synthesis process.",
              "Because mRNA is large (104\u2013106 Da) and negatively charged, it cannot pass through the anionic lipid bilayer of cell membranes.",
              "Moreover, inside the body, it is engulfed by cells of the innate immune system and degraded by nucleases.",
              "Various techniques, including electroporation, gene guns and ex vivo transfection can intracellularly deliver mRNA in a dish23.",
              "In vivo application, however, requires the use of mRNA delivery vehicles that transfect immune cells without causing toxicity or unwanted immunogenicity (Fig.",

              "however, unlike its predecessors SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently from person to person.",
              "In the absence of a vaccine, public health measures such as quarantine of newly diagnosed cases, contact tracing, use of face masks and physical distancing have been put into place to reduce transmission4.",
              "It is estimated that until 60\u201370% of the population have immunity, COVID-19 is unlikely to be sufficiently well-controlled for normal human activities to resume.",
              "If immunity remains solely dependent on infection, even at a case fatality rate of 1%, more than 40 million people could succumb to COVID-19 globally5.",
              "Therefore, rapid development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for changing the global dynamics of this virus.",
              "The spike (S) protein, a class I fusion glycoprotein analogous to influenza haemagglutinin, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion glycoprotein (F) and human immunodeficiency virus gp160 (Env), is the major surface protein on the coronavirus virion and the primary target for neutralizing antibodies.",
              "S proteins undergo marked structural rearrangement to fuse virus and host cell membranes, enabling delivery of the viral genome into target cells.",
              "We previously showed that prefusion-stabilized protein immunogens that preserve neutralization-sensitive epitopes are an effective vaccine strategy for enveloped viruses such as RSV6,7,8,9,10.",
              "Subsequently, we identified 2 proline substitutions (2P) at the apex of the central helix and heptad repeat 1 that effectively stabilized MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus HKU1 S proteins in the prefusion conformation1,11,12.",
              "Similar to other prefusion-stabilized fusion proteins, MERS-CoV S(2P) protein was more immunogenic at lower doses than wild-type S protein1.",
              "The 2P mutation has similar effects on the stability of S proteins from other betacoronaviruses, suggesting a generalizable approach for designing stabilized-prefusion Betacoronavirus S protein antigens for vaccination.",
              "Such generalizability is fundamental to the prototype pathogen approach for pandemic preparedness13,14.",
              "Coronaviruses have long been predicted to have a high probability of causing zoonotic disease and pandemics15,16.",
              "As part of our pandemic preparedness efforts, we have studied MERS-CoV as a prototype Betacoronavirus pathogen to optimize vaccine design, dissect the humoral immune response to vaccination, and identify mechanisms and correlates of protection.",
              "Achieving an effective and rapid vaccine response to a newly emerging virus requires both the precision afforded by structure-based antigen design and a manufacturing platform to shorten time to product availability.",
              "Producing cell lines and clinical-grade subunit protein typically takes more than one year, whereas manufacturing nucleic acid vaccines can be achieved in a matter of weeks17,18.",
              "In addition to advantages in manufacturing speed, mRNA vaccines are potently immunogenic and elicit both humoral and cellular immunity19,20,21.",

              "By injecting cells with a synthetic mRNA that encodes a viral spike protein, an mRNA vaccine can direct human cells to make a viral spike protein and evoke an immune response without a person ever having been exposed to the viral material.",
              "These viral spike proteins, or antigens, normally coat the surface of the virus and are recognized by antibodies and other immune cells that prepare and protect the body against the virus.",
              "If a person is later exposed to the virus, antibodies and other parts of the immune system can recognize and attack the virus before it can infect healthy cells or cause illness.",
              "Traditional vaccines work by giving a person either viral proteins or an inactivated or weakened version of a virus that triggers an immune response.",
              "mRNA vaccines do not contain viral material.",
              "Instead, these vaccines contain lipid or fat bubbles that surround a segment of mRNA, which provide cells with the instructions to make a certain viral protein.",

              "mRNA vaccines do not contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus, so you cannot get COVID-19 from an mRNA vaccine.",
              "One of the most exciting aspects of mRNA technology is how rapidly it can be developed to target a particular virus.",
              "While traditional vaccines can take years, creating an mRNA-based vaccine that targets a newly discovered virus can be accomplished in a short period of time (days to weeks to make the new vaccine candidate) and primarily requires knowledge of the viral genetic code.",
              "This greatly speeds up vaccine development.",

              "As he listened to Rossi describe his use of modified mRNA, Langer recalled, he realized the young professor had discovered something far bigger than a novel way to create stem cells.",
              "Cloaking mRNA so it could slip into cells to produce proteins had a staggering number of applications, Langer thought, and might even save millions of lives.",

              "This technology exhibits promising potential for the development of novel vaccines against a wide variety of indications and diseases, extending from prophylactics to therapeutics for infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and hypersensitivities.",
              "While nucleic-acid-based vaccines demonstrate significant advantages over traditional vaccines [3] in terms of safety, efficacy, induction of both B- and T-cell responses and specificity, it is noteworthy to mention that mRNA vaccines have advantages when compared to vaccines based on other types of nucleic acids.",
              "A technical challenge associated with DNA vaccines is to ensure delivery into the cell nucleus, where antigen transcription takes place prior to nuclear export and translation into protein in the cytoplasm.",
              "In addition, DNA vaccines carry a potential risk of integration into the host genome, which may result in insertional mutagenesis.",
              "In contrast, mRNA vaccines are only targeted for cytoplasmic delivery, circumventing the risk of genomic integration [4].",
              "The relatively short half-life results in transient and more controlled expression of the encoded antigen.",
              "Moreover, mRNA can be produced in a cell-free environment by in vitro transcription (IVT), thereby eschewing the use of microbes or cultured cells for production, and avoiding the associated quality and safety issues in the production.",
              "This permits simple downstream purification and rapid and cost-effective manufacturing [5].",
              "However, mRNA is often promulgated on the grounds of the popular opinion that when using mRNA, unlike DNA, the stringent gene-therapy regulations are bypassed because mRNA does not integrate into the host genome.",
              "However, in reality, this only holds true in the US since in Europe, any active pharmaceutical ingredient, which contains or consists of a recombinant nucleic acid, used in or administered to human beings, falls under the scope of the regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products [6].",
              "Therefore, mRNA-based therapeutics are categorized as gene therapy.",
              "The burgeoning field of mRNA vaccines is very exciting [3,7] and considerable amounts of relevant preclinical data have been generated, and several clinical trials have been initiated during the last decade.",

              "Non-viral vectors possess several advantages compared to the viral vectors, including low host immunogenicity and potential for scale-up [10].",
              "However, the success of non-viral gene therapy has been very limited in the past, primarily due to the barriers existing for plasmid DNA (pDNA) delivery, e.",
              "g., the necessity to cross the nuclear membrane before translation, the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in pDNA, and most importantly, the difficulty in controlling and regulating long-term expression.",
              "The lack of control of long-term expression of pDNA poses a huge disadvantage in terms of the duration of treatment and possible side effects, which is in contrast to conventional drugs, where the treatment can be stopped instantaneously.",
              "These disadvantages of pDNA can possibly be overcome by using mRNA [11].",
              "The mRNA carries genetic information from the DNA in the nucleus to the cytosol, where it is used by the ribosomes as a template for protein synthesis.",
              "As opposed to pDNA, the mRNA is efficacious in both mitotic and non-mitotic cells because mRNA exerts its function in the cytoplasm, hence its function is not dependent on active cell division.",
              "Furthermore, unlike pDNA or viral vectors, mRNA does not contain additional foreign genes, which makes mRNA a safer vector.",
              "The challenge of long-term expression posed by pDNA can also be overcome by using mRNA, since mRNA mediates a rapid, transient expression of the encoded protein and the duration of the production is well-defined (usually a few days or weeks, depending on the specific mRNA platform).",
              "This makes mRNA expression easier to control than the gene expression from pDNA and viral vectors [11].",
              "In addition, the manufacturing of mRNA is cell-free, which strongly reduces the chance of mRNA contamination with bacterial components.",
              "This makes it easier to produce mRNA than pDNA under good manufacturing practice conditions [12].",
              "Finally, vector-induced immunogenicity can be avoided for mRNA therapeutics, unlike for viral vectors or virus-like particles, which may elicit a specific immune response against the exposed viral proteins [13].",

              "They efficiently amplify the production of sub-genomic mRNA encoding antigen(s) of interest subsequent to a single round of replication.",
              "While both self-amplifying mRNA and non-replicating mRNA find application in prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases, non-replicating mRNA is used for cancer vaccines.",
              "In vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA is employed therapeutically as it mimics fully mature native mRNA present in the eukaryotic cytosol [16].",
              "This may be achieved either by ex vivo transfection of cells with mRNA that are then adoptively transferred or by direct in vivo delivery of the IVT mRNA to the cytosol [17].",
              "These approaches are explored for genome engineering, genetic reprogramming, adoptive T cell and dendritic cell (DC) based cancer and infectious disease immunotherapies, tolerization regimens to treat allergies, and protein replacement therapies.",
              "Both ex vivo transfection and direct in vivo transfection enable the target cells to synthesize the encoded protein(s) in situ, where mRNA is used as a template and the protein(s) represents the active product.",
              "The open reading frame (ORF) of mature mRNA encoding the protein(s) of interest (the active product) marked by start and stop codons, respectively, is flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs), and ideally consists of a 5\u2019 cap and a poly(A) tail [3].",
              "The pharmacodynamic activity of both native and IVT mRNA takes place in the cytosol (Figure 1).",
              "However, in contrast to endogenous mRNA, which is transcribed from DNA in the nucleus and enters the cytosol through nuclear export, IVT mRNA enters the cytosol from an extracellular source [18].",
              "Once the IVT mRNA is delivered to the cytosol, its pharmacology is governed by the same complex cellular mechanisms that regulate the stability and translation of endogenous mRNA.",
              "The engineered IVT mRNA resembles the endogenous mRNA so closely that the cellular translation machinery is seamlessly utilized to synthesize a protein that may undergo post-translational modifications, eventually resulting in mature protein product(s).",
              "In the case of vaccines, this mature protein product(s) represents the antigen(s), which may elicit potent pathogen-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.",
              "However, the final intracellular destination is determined by the natural or engineered sequence(s) of the signal peptide or the transmembrane domain [7].",

              "During the following 10 years, several studies demonstrated that mRNA could induce an immunologic response to the expressed protein in many mammalian cell types both in vitro and in vivo [17], [18], [19] mRNA technology presents several advantages that makes it an attractive alternative over traditional vaccines or even DNA vaccines.",
              "Unlike attenuated or inactivated vaccines, mRNA is precise as it will only express a specific antigen and induce a directed immune response.",
              "Additionally, it promotes both humoral and cellular immune response and induces the innate immune system [20].",
              "Compared with DNA-based vaccines, mRNA is more effective, since expression does not require nuclear entry, and safer, since the probability of random genome integration is virtually zero [21], [22].",
              "Additionally, expression of the coded antigens is transient since mRNA is quickly degraded by cellular processes, with no traces found after 2\u20133 days [23].",
              "The flexible nature of the mRNA vaccine platform is also advantageous for manufacturing since a change in the encoded antigen does not affect the mRNA backbone physical\u2013chemical characteristics [24], and hence allow production to be standardized.",
              "Additionally, since production is based on an in vitro cell-free transcription reaction, safety concerns regarding the presence of cell-derived impurities and viral contaminants commonly found in other platforms are minimised.",
              "Construction of mRNA vaccines requires the insertion of the encoded antigen in a DNA template from where the mRNA is transcribed in vitro.",
              "Unlike DNA, mRNA only needs to reach the cytosol, where it will be transcribed into the antigen in vivo, using the cell machinery.",

              "Inside the cells, RNA is recognised by endosomal or cytosolic receptors, which can lead to the activation of the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway, and to the promotion of the production of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines.",
              "These signal molecules lead to antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation and, subsequently, to a strong adaptive response [25].",
              "The structure of mRNA vaccines is similar to eukaryotic mRNA - a single-stranded molecule with a cap at the 5\u2032 end, a poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032 end and an open reading frame (ORF) flanked by untranslated regions (UTR) [20].",
              "The 5\u2032 cap is an important component as it enables the translation initiation by binding to a eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E) [26].",

              "This modification brings with it a number of advantages as it improves the translation initiation by recruiting translation initiation factors, protects the synthetic mRNA against exonuclease degradation [30], and avoids an innate immunity overactivation response [25].",
              "The addition of a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail also improves mRNA stability and translational activities, as it protects mRNA from nuclease degradation by the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) [31].",
              "This tail can be added to the transcript by inserting a poly(A) sequence in the DNA template or by an enzymatic reaction [27].",

              "Longer poly-A tails can improve mRNA stability and translation.",

              "This form presents several advantages - molecules are simple and small, and the possibility of unwanted immune response is lowered since no other proteins are encoded [32].",
              "However, this mRNA expression is limited to its transient nature, and higher mRNA doses may be necessary to achieve high expression [33].",

              "This system presents some advantages over saRNA since it is safer, more versatile and cost-effective to manufacture, as the production of shorter RNAs with high yield and high quality is less challenging.",
              "taRNA has already been used to protect mice against influenza with results showing induction of antibodies and protection[37].",
              "mRNA must cross the cell membrane to reach the cytosol.",

              "A single-stranded sequence of deoxythymidine (dT) - Oligo dT - is routinely used for the capture of mRNA in laboratory applications.",
              "This sequence binds to the poly-A tails present in the mRNA.",
              "Chromatographic beads with immobilized oligo dT could thus be used for the process scale purification using affinity chromatography: the poly-A tails of the single stranded mRNA produced during IVT would bind to the stationary phase while impurities are washed out.",
              "This way, IVT unconsumed reagents, the DNA template and dsRNA could be efficiently removed [105].",
              "While high purity products can be obtained using affinity chromatography, several drawbacks are present such as low binding capacities and a less cost-effective process.",
              "The removal of small size impurities can also be achieved while concentrating or diafiltrating solutions by tangential flow filtration (TFF) [106], [107].",
              "Core bead chromatography can also be used for this purpose [108].",
              "In this case, small impurities are trapped inside the beads, and the product will be in the flowthrough.",
              "However, both techniques rely on DNase digestion or denaturing agents to remove high size molecules such as the DNA template or the polymerase.",
              "DNA removal can also be achieved using hydroxyapatite chromatography without the use of a DNase [108].",
              "As a polishing step, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) can be applied using connective interaction media monolith (CIM) containing OH or SO3 ligands [109].",
              "Large scale adaptations of the traditional laboratory scale mRNA purification methods are also being explored.",
              "For example, mRNA precipitation can be combined with TFF technique [106].",
              "During TFF, the membrane captures the precipitated mRNA product while other impurities are removed by diafiltration.",
              "The product is then eluted by re-solubilizing the mRNA.",
              "Furthermore, DNA template removal can be achieved by performing the digestion with immobilised DNase [110].",
              "Another approach is to use tagged DNA template that can then be removed after IVT using affinity chromatography [110].",
              "Despite being scalable, these methods present a limited effectiveness since they only focus on the removal of some specific impurities and hence must be coupled with other purification steps.",
              "The current IVT mRNA production methods must be improved to move mRNA technology to commercialisation and to support market demand.",
              "As process yields and production scale have an impact on the manufacturing costs and consequentially on the cost per dose [92], we speculate that continuous processing would have a particular advantage to lower costs.",
              "Continuous processing is already used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry to run flexible and cost-effective processes and will ultimately offer on demand production.",
              "Additionally, the process integration made possible by continuous manufacturing may also reduce operation time and facilitate automation and process analytical technologies (PAT), which can result in a higher productivity and higher product quality [111], [112].",
              "The relative simplicity of mRNA manufacturing makes the process well suited for continuous processing, and in particular at a microfluidic scale (Fig.",
              "5 ).",
              "At this scale, reaction rates can be accelerated under specific conditions, the use of expensive reagents can be minimised, and cascade reactions can be compartmentalised easily [113].",
              "Further, in situ product removal (ISPR) and substrate feed and product recovery (SFPR) strategies can be implemented in flow to facilitate process control, recirculation, and re-use of compounds [113].",
              "These strategies will allow the separation of molecules, such as enzymes (if free enzymes are used), co-factors or NTPs, that can be recirculated in the process.",
              "Different unit operations, such as TFF, aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) or precipitation, could be used for this purpose.",
              "These potentially will lower the burden on the downstream processing as well as the overall processing costs.",
              "furthermore, the proposed system could be coupled with a microfluidic formulation step, in which the mRNA is encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) [116].",
              "This would allow the establishment of continuous mRNA processing until the fill-to-finish steps.",
              "Conceptual design of a continuous manufacturing process for the production of mRNA vaccines.",
              "The process is composed of a 2-step enzymatic reaction in continuous form, followed by enzyme recycling using tangential flow filtration strategies and two multimodal chromatography steps, one in bind-elute mode for the intermediate purification, and a second in flowthrough mode for polishing.",
              "Formulation is achieved using a third tangential flow filtration module.",
              "Downstream processing, together with fill-to-finish, is still the major bottleneck in the mRNA vaccine production due to the lack of well-established and cost-effective processes.",
              "Despite the effort to develop methods that achieve high purity products, most of them are coupled with the traditional precipitation or nuclease digestion techniques [102], [108].",
              "Moreover, most methods are not cost-effective which can make the process infeasible for the market needs.",
              "Alternative cost-effective techniques, such a single-pass tangential flow filtration (SPTFF) or aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), that can be applied in a continuous mode, could potentially improve the process time and manufacturing flexibility while reducing cost and maintaining the quality [114].",
              "Additionally, new chromatographic operation modes can overcome the need for having multiple mRNA purification steps (Fig.",
              "5).",
              "For example, the use of multimodal chromatography is highly promising as the combination of interactions between the molecule and the matrix could result in an integrated and intensified purification process without the need for multiple chromatographic steps [115].",
              "mRNA manufacturing is advantageous when compared to the production of most biologicals since it does not require the use of cell cultures.",
              "Owing to its fast reaction time, the risk of contamination is lower than what is observed with other complex vaccine manufacturing processes.",
              "Additionally, the non-integrative nature and the transient expression inside the cells favours the mRNA safety profile [58], [117].",
              "Regulation guidelines for the evaluation of quality, safety and efficacy of RNA-based prophylactic vaccines for infection diseases are now being considered [118].",

              "g., in terms of product yields, and analytical technologies that allows for rigorous product quantification and characterisation (product identity, purity and quality).",
              "mRNA quality can be assessed using several analytical techniques, such as gel electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [117], while the identity can be assured using sequencing techniques, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or next-generation sequencing [118].",
              "The presence of residual amounts of DNA, enzymes and solvents [119], as well as dsRNA and truncated RNA fragments, must be determined.",
              "Additionally, as a general quality control, aspects like the presence of endotoxins, overall sterility and mRNA stability, must also be evaluated [118].",

              "Although the IVT reaction of mRNA is safer and quicker than most of the established vaccines production, it relies on the use of expensive and limited materials.",
              "Downstream processing of the vaccine is still poorly established, and it is dependent on methods that lack scalability and cost-effectiveness.",

              "These included the instability of mRNA in vivo, due to the near-ubiquitous presence of RNases.",
              "In addition, the mRNA was quite immunogenic, stimulating innate responses with a concomitant decrease in translation of the mRNA.",
              "While innate immune responses might be beneficial for vaccine applications of mRNA, the stability and hence mRNA production challenges still remained.",
              "A significant advance that led to the rapid expansion of efforts to use mRNA as a platform technology was the discovery by Kariko\u0301 and Weissman that the use of modified nucleosides resulted in a decrease in the immunostimulatory effects of the in-vitro transcribed mRNA, via a decrease in Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation (as further explained below in Section 3) [11].",
              "They went on to show that, by the use of pseudouridine in place of uridine, the resulting mRNA was also more stable and had increased translational capability [12].",
              "A further development by Schlake and colleagues [13] enabled the production of mRNA that similarly did not stimulate the innate responses and avoided decreased protein production simply with sequence engineering, without the need for nucleoside modification.",
              "The development of formulations (mainly LNPs) that both help stabilize the mRNA and facilitate its delivery into cells and release from endosomes [14] (and likely act as adjuvants for the encoded protein [15]) has also been crucial.",
              "LNPs are composed of various lipids, often including phospholipids, cholesterol, ionic lipids, and polyethylene glycol-conjugated lipid, which form to have an aqueous center in which the charged mRNA molecules are located.",
              "The mRNA is thus protected, and the lipid particle facilitates entry into cells and even exit from lysosomes for delivery of the mRNA, as further described by Reichmuth and colleagues [14].",
              "Manufacturers have their own proprietary LNPs with differing characteristics and methods of manufacture.",
              "Because new LNP formulations will be developed (such as one manufacturer is currently doing to improve thermostability), and because the actual composition (such as percentage of each component) and the manufacturing process is proprietary, this information is beyond the scope of this manuscript.",
              "Note that while the focus of most vaccine candidates that are using mRNA technology has been on antibody responses, T-cell responses have also been shown to be generated by mRNA vaccines.",
              "These include CD4+ T-helper cells, which are needed for optimal antibody responses [16,17].",
              "The role of T cells in the assessment of vaccine efficacy may be difficult to determine (in terms of any correlate of immunity), as no vaccines based solely on T-cell responses have been developed.",
              "Nevertheless, the role of both types of T cells in both generating antibody responses (T-cell help) and their ability to kill virally-infected cells (cytolytic T lymphocytes) add this additional arm of immunity to mRNA vaccines.",
              "For example, anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cells may be important, since neutralizing antibodies wane over time [18,19].",
              "Another type of mRNA vaccine is called self-amplifying RNA vaccine, earlier versions of which have been made and studied pre-clinically with plasmid DNA vaccines and with viral vectors (reviewed in [1]).",
              "A self-amplifying mRNA (samRNA) vaccine encodes both the desired antigen and key viral replicon proteins derived from a different virus, such as alphaviruses, and not from the target virus.",
              "The production of the alphaviral replicon encoded by the mRNA results in the transduced cell then being able to produce many copies of the antigen mRNA, and hence much more of the protein antigen than would usually be produced per molecule of mRNA encoding the antigen.",
              "This is done without making a whole virus, since the mRNA only codes for the antigen and the specific replicon proteins.",
              "Because many more copies of the protein antigen will be made, such a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine may be more potent and might not require a booster dose.",
              "A significant reason for the enthusiastic embrace of mRNA for a COVID-19 vaccine is the speed with which a vaccine candidate can be generated, since the mRNA construct can be generated based on knowing a pathogen\u2019s genetic sequence and the antigen to target.",
              "Another reason for the interest is that the manufacturing process is one that is essentially generic for mRNA vaccines and independent of the antigen encoded by the vaccine.",
              "The manufacturing process involves in-vitro transcription of a DNA template that contains the mRNA sequence.",
              "This mRNA has standard elements, such as a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a start codon and an open reading frame (ORF), a stop codon followed by a 3\u2032 UTR and a poly(A) sequence (see Figure 1).",
              "The ORF is frequently optimized for expression (both codon optimization, and optimization of RNA for translation and stability have been used).",

              "In addition, both in pre-clinical and clinical studies, the goal is finding the optimal level of immune stimulation while limiting any clinical adverse events (such as injection-site soreness, or systemic symptoms like chills) due to the strong immune responses.",
              "mRNA stimulates innate-immune responses, and a variety of cellular pathways are activated, including Toll-Like Receptors: TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8 of the innate immune system, as well as via various cytoplasmic proteins, notably PKR (Protein Kinase R), RIG-I (Retinoic Acid-Inducible Gene I), OAS (2\u2032-5\u2032-Oligoadenylate synthetases), and MDA5 (Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5) via cytoplasmic proteins [21].",
              "While the use of modified nucleosides has resulted in a decrease in the immunostimulatory activity of mRNA, inflammation resulted in some non-serious, adverse events clinically, which are described in the reports of the clinical trials [16,17], and resulted in selecting the second highest dose in two cases [16,17].",
              "The vaccine industry, scientific community and public health officials have discussed the possibility of lowering the dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine compared with the dosage originally evaluated in Phase 3 trials.",
              "This would significantly increase the number of available doses providing that it does not affect vaccine efficacy.",
              "Of note is the fact that self-amplifying RNA vaccines generally are not produced with modified nucleosides, since the RNA amplified in the cell will be synthesized with unmodified nucleosides.",
              "The rapidity with which clinical trials are progressing for COVID-19 vaccines and for potential worldwide usage have created a need for the WHO to address the relevant characteristics of mRNA vaccines in order to evaluate the quality, safety, and efficacy of mRNA for prophylactic vaccines.",
              "The inherent immunological and structural properties of mRNA, the need for formulation for delivery, and the manufacturing process all need to be considered, even though certain information for any specific vaccine candidate may be proprietary and thus not generally known at this time in order to set specific guidance.",
              "In addition to the more general issues that need to be considered for prophylactic vaccines, there are certain considerations that may be specific for COVID-19 vaccines, due to the specific and protean pathophysiologic manifestations that have been seen in severe infection with SARS-CoV-2.",
              "One of these considerations is the potential for vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease (VERD), which has been seen with some vaccines for other viruses [22] and appears to be minimised with vaccines that induce at Th1-type immune response.",
              "Many of the regulatory issues required for mRNA vaccines are similar to those for any vaccine such as quality of the starting materials, consistency of manufacture, demonstrated evidence of safety and efficacy during pre-clinical studies, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance.",
              "Some recent reviews have discussed regulatory issues for the manufacture, quality control, and safety for mRNA vaccines [23,24,25].",
              "Nevertheless, because the production of mRNA vaccines involves new technologies, some of the regulatory considerations are specific to this class of vaccine.",
              "While the process of producing the mRNA (or samRNA) seems to be coalescing around enzymatic synthesis of the RNA from a linear DNA template using a phage DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and complexing the RNA in lipid nanoparticles, the process details generally remain proprietary and not available to the public.",
              "Thus, at this time, it is not possible to define specific principles for evaluation of mRNA vaccines.",
              "Therefore, regulatory requirements should be established by national regulatory authorities on the basis of WHO Guidelines or Recommendations for evaluation of vaccines.",
              "The quality and consistency of the enzymes, nucleotides, and the linear DNA templates are critical.",
              "The raw materials such as the lipids should be carefully controlled and their purity demonstrated.",
              "The linear DNA template should be generated under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), although at early stages of vaccine development, this may not be necessary.",
              "Some of the important considerations for the Drug Substance are the purity of the RNA, with the proportion of full-length transcripts and the amounts of short transcripts and double-stranded RNA present being critical parameters to monitor, as is the percentage of mRNA that is capped and polyadenylated.",
              "For the Drug Product, however it is produced, it is important to quantify the amount of mRNA encapsulated in the particle, and determine the size distribution of the particles, which is used to monitor the consistency of manufacture.",
              "Some of the usual parameters to monitor include stability, identity, and sterility.",
              "Thermal stability of mRNA vaccines is one of the challenges for vaccine developers, regulators and users.",
              "A cold-chain requirement is considered as one of the limitations for the use of mRNA vaccines particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where it might be difficult to ensure transportation and storage of vaccines under a cold chain.",
              "Assays to determine potency for this platform are under development and should be discussed with the national regulatory authority, but cell-free translation of mRNA extracted from the Drug Product and transfection of cells in culture with the Drug Product and detection of the antigen by some immunological method are two commonly used methods to ascertain that the mRNA encodes the desired antigen.",
              "In the context of animal studies and clinical trials in humans, monitoring of systemic and local toxicity and inflammatory responses are expected.",
              "If needed, dose lowering may need to be considered.",
              "Apart from demonstrated issues with mRNA vaccines, there are also some perceptions that regulators need to address.",
              "New production technologies usually raise some questions about the safety of the novel products.",
              "One of the concerns expressed is related to the potential risk of the RNA integrating into human DNA.",
              "It should be noted that while there was a theoretical concern for integration into the host genome with regard to plasmid DNA vaccines, this concern is not shared for mRNA-based vaccines for the following reasons.",
              "(1) mRNA remains in the cytoplasm and is not transported to the nucleus.",
              "(2) For integration, the mRNA likely needs to be converted to a DNA molecule.",
              "Although it is possible that single-stranded DNA can be integrated, the integrating form of DNA is generally double-stranded DNA.",
              "This requires the presence of a reverse transcriptase and appropriate primers and complementary binding sites on the mRNA to generate first a single-stranded DNA and then convert this single-stranded DNA to a double-stranded DNA, which again requires appropriate primers and binding sites.",
              "In retroviruses, this process occurs in the retrovirus particle.",
              "This is not the case with mRNA vaccines, for while endogenous reverse transcriptases are present in mammalian cells, the enzymes and RNA are not found in the appropriate complex to allow efficient reverse transcription to occur.",
              "(3) The final step in retroviral integration requires the activity of the viral integrase, which again is in the retroviral particle.",
              "Integration of naked double-stranded DNA has been shown to be very inefficient.",
              "(4) The vaccine mRNA has been shown to degrade within a relative short time once taken up in the body\u2019s cells.",
              "Finally, because cellular mRNA is more abundant than a mRNA vaccine, it is highly unlikely that a cellular reverse transcriptase (RT) would preferentially copy the vaccine mRNA over cellular mRNA.",
              "For all these reasons, the integration risk of mRNA vaccines has been considered negligible.",
              "As part of its mandate, WHO has a unique role to support regulatory authorities in its 194 member states.",
              "One of WHO core functions is \u201csetting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation\u201d.",
              "The Expert Committee on Biological Standardization (ECBS) has been active in establishing WHO standards for biologicals for more than 70 years.",
              "WHO standards, both written and measurement, are based on scientific evidence and provide the basis for establishing and updating national regulatory requirements.",
              "They also provide a global perspective and are published in the WHO Technical Report Series.",
              "The role of the international recommendations or guidelines for biological substances is to ensure the availability of vaccines of assured quality, safety and efficacy for use in international immunization programmes.",
              "Furthermore, these documents serve as a benchmark for global acceptability of products and as a basis for defining national regulatory requirements for licensing as well as for post-licensure evaluation.",
              "These activities include both measurement (physical standards) and written standards for vaccines, biotherapeutic products and other biologicals, intended as guidance for National Regulatory Authorities and manufacturers.",
              "The development of measurement standards involves elaborate collaborative studies in numerous laboratories worldwide, and the WHO written standards are based on scientific consensus achieved through much international consultation.",
              "The work is supported by WHO Collaborating Centres, National Regulatory Authorities in many countries, pharmacopoeias, manufacturers associations, and academia.",
              "As examples of the measurement standards for COVID-19, the First WHO International Standard of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin with assigned unitage of 250 IU/ampoule (neutralizing antibody activity) and the First WHO International Reference Panel of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin were established by WHO ECBS on 10th December 2020.",
              "These standards are intended as global reference reagents against which national reference preparations would be calibrated.",
              "Calibration of national references against a single global standard will facilitate comparison of results of assays (e.",
              "g., of the antibody response to candidate COVID-19 vaccines) conducted in different countries.",
              "The development and scientific assessment through collaborative studies of these reagents have been completed in record time, and the standards were made available by WHO Collaborating Centre, National Institute for Biological Standardization and Control (NIBSC), the United Kingdom, at the end of December 2020.",
              "It is expected that the use of these standards would contribute to the better understanding of the immune response, particularly correlates of protection, which are of great importance for the success of immunization.",
              "WHO also plays an important role in the implementation of new guidelines and recommendations that also serve as tools for global regulatory convergence.",
              "Detailed information about WHO international standards for biologicals can be found at the WHO biologicals website [26].",
              "In addition, WHO has other initiatives that are closely linked to the standardization of vaccines.",
              "In particular, strengthening of national regulatory authorities is one of the important elements in assuring the quality of vaccines worldwide.",
              "Prequalification of vaccines is an important mechanism through which vaccines prequalified by WHO become subject of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) supply.",
              "The safety of vaccines and the issues discussed at the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety are also important as well as WHO activities related to the immunization policy led by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts.",
              "In the context of all these activities, mRNA vaccines need to be considered as new immunization tools of critical importance for the control of the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 with an expectation that vaccines produced with this technology will also play a role in the control of other diseases.",
              "In view of the development of mRNA vaccines and scientific and regulatory challenges faced, it is considered necessary to establish an international consensus on the technical expectations for the development and evaluation of mRNA vaccines.",
              "This will facilitate international convergence of manufacturing and regulatory practices for mRNA vaccines worldwide, and provide technical assistance to countries.",
              "The availability of WHO standards will also facilitate WHO prequalification or Emergency Use Listing assessment of such vaccines, in particular in the case of current COVID-19 pandemic.",
              "Although there are a number of guidance documents available from WHO in terms of assuring the quality, safety and efficacy of vaccines, there are currently no guidelines specifically for vaccines based on RNA platforms. The WHO ECBS discussed these issues at its meeting in August and December 2020 and supported the development of a document on regulatory considerations for the evaluation of mRNA vaccines, which could be updated as more scientific and clinical data became available.",
              "In urgent response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, as of end December 2020, some mRNA vaccines have been the subject of review and regulatory approval for emergency use.",
              "However, ongoing and future studies are needed to address unknowns and gaps of evidence that are critical for completing the data for the purpose of licensing these vaccines.",
              "The step from the approval for emergency use to the licensing may require a number of additional studies depending on the intended use and supportive data for demonstration of the quality, safety and efficacy of vaccines.",
              "WHO endeavors to convene international discussions among experts of vaccine developers, manufacturers and regulators to review available scientific evidence, discuss key issues and reach consensus on scientific and technical expectations towards assuring the quality, safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines.",
              "At the time of writing this paper, WHO assembled a drafting group composed of experts from the scientific field of mRNA vaccines and regulatory authorities to develop a draft document that will cover manufacturing and quality, non-clinical and clinical issues of mRNA vaccines.",
              "In addition, a number of regulatory issues and challenges would be elaborated in that document to provide information about current regulatory thinking on the key principles for evaluation of these vaccines.",
              "WHO will convene public consultations as well as consultations with stakeholders starting from January 2021 to seek critical review of the draft document and invite comments.",
              "The final document, formulated on the basis of scientific evidence and broad consensus, taking into consideration input from stakeholders, will be submitted to the ECBS for review in late 2021.",
              "Fundamentally important, vaccine developers, especially those that are at advanced levels of development, e.",
              "g., entered Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 clinical trials and thus may have proof of vaccine safety and efficacy, are strongly encouraged to share with the public the data for candidate mRNA vaccines in terms of quality, safety and clinical aspects.",
              "Various global or regional regulatory forums are already available to discuss issues relevant to the quality, safety and efficacy of the products across nations/agencies.",
              "Meanwhile, technologies are also advancing (e.",
              "g., optimization of production, new technology) along with better understanding of the target pathogens and the mRNA platforms. These are all important factors to be taken into consideration when formulating WHO guidance for mRNA vaccines.",
              "It is hoped that in the near future more data on mRNA vaccines in terms of their quality, safety and efficacy will be available to the public, and an international consensus will be reached among stakeholders on the technical specifications of mRNA vaccines towards assured quality, safety and efficacy.",

              "As a solution, many researchers have learned to alter certain chemical features of the mRNA transcript to make it less attractive to nucleases.",
              "For example, Juozas S\u030ciurkus, senior R&D manager at Thermo Fisher Scientific, notes that his company offers reagents that allow researchers to modulate the length of the polyadenine tail found at the 3\u2019 end of every mRNA transcript.",
              "\u201cThese [changes] can define the half-life of the mRNA,\u201d S\u030ciurkus notes.",

              "Because many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, rely on RNA rather than DNA as their genomic material, the human immune system frequently perceives foreign RNA as a threat.",
              "\u201cDifferent RNA sequences can trigger different levels of activation,\u201d explains Dong.",
              "\u201cMaybe there's cytokine release or recruitment of different immune cells, but it can be quite a severe response.",
              "\u201d In recent years, researchers have learned that the strategic substitution of certain nucleotides at the mRNA synthesis stage can dampen this effect.",
              "For example, cytosine and uracil nucleotides can be respectively swapped with chemically-modified alternatives like 5-methylcytosine or pseudouridine.",
              "Such substitutions can mute the immune response while also bolstering the stability of the mRNA and the efficiency of translation.",
              "Thermo Fisher Scientific offers a variety of such modified nucleotides as part of its TheraPure product family.",
              "While such modifications can reduce adverse events from mRNA administration, Dong notes that there are some instances where immunogenicity is an advantage.",
              "For example, his group is developing a cancer therapy based on mRNA that encodes an immunity-stimulating cytokine.",
              "He has found that the innate immune response to the mRNA itself can actually deliver an efficacy boost.",
              "\u201cThat's very helpful to remove the primary tumour and also establish whole-body anti-tumour immunity,\u201d Dong says.",

              "Sahay, who works extensively with lipid nanoparticles, notes that these are typically formulated with a mixture of four different lipids.",
              "These collectively facilitate the delivery of the RNA-laden particles to cell membranes and the subsequent uptake into cells via endocytosis.",
              "As a final step, the RNA cargo must be released from the endosomes responsible for nanoparticle uptake.",
              "This last step remains a significant bottleneck in the mRNA delivery process, but researchers are making steady gains in delivery efficiency.",
              "For example, Sahay says that the latest generation of lipid nanoparticles can release up to 25% of their payload into the cytosol.",
              "This still leaves behind a lot of unused mRNA, potentially necessitating larger or more frequent doses, although even a small quantity of mRNA can have a potent effect.",
              "\u201cJust a few mRNA reads can then create a lot of proteins,\u201d says Sahay, noting that he has obtained promising preclinical data from mRNA-based therapies for chronic diseases like cystic fibrosis.",

              "The ability to express genetic circuits in the absence of the rest of the genome allows experiments to be carried out in isolation without endogenous DNA.",

              "The advantages of CFPS over in vivo protein expression include its open system, the elimination of reliance on living cells, and the ability to focus all system energy on production of the protein of interest.",
              "Over the last 60 years, the CFPS platform has grown and diversified greatly, and it continues to evolve today.",
              "Both new applications and new types of extracts based on a variety of organisms are current areas of development.",
              "However, new users interested in CFPS may find it challenging to implement a cell-free platform in their laboratory due to the technical and functional considerations involved in choosing and executing a platform that best suits their needs.",
              "Here we hope to reduce this barrier to implementing CFPS by clarifying the similarities and differences amongst cell-free platforms, highlighting the various applications that have been accomplished in each of them, and detailing the main methodological and instrumental requirement for their preparation.",
              "Additionally, this review will help to contextualize the landscape of work that has been done using CFPS and showcase the diversity of applications that it enables.",
              "Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) emerged about 60 years ago as a platform used by Nirenberg and Matthaei to decipher the genetic code and discover the link between mRNA and protein synthesis [1].",
              "Since this discovery, the CFPS platform has grown to enable a variety of applications, from functional genomics to large-scale antibody production [2,3].",
              "Currently, CFPS has been implemented using cell extracts from numerous different organisms, with their unique biochemistries enabling a broad set of applications.",
              "In an effort to assist the user in selecting the CFPS platform that is best suited to their experimental goals, this review provides an in-depth analysis of high adoption CFPS platforms in the scientific community, the applications that they enable, and methods to implement them.",
              "We also review applications enabled by low adoption platforms, including applications proposed in emerging platforms. We hope that this will simplify new users\u2019 choice between platforms, thereby reducing the barrier to implementation and improving broader accessibility of the CFPS platform.",
              "The growing interest in CFPS is the result of the key advantages associated with the open nature of the platform.",
              "The CFPS reaction lacks a cellular membrane and a functional genome, and consequently is not constrained by the cell\u2019s life objectives [4].",
              "Therefore, the metabolic and cytotoxic burdens placed on the cell when attempting to produce large quantities of recombinant proteins in vivo are obviated in CFPS [5].",
              "The CFPS platform is amenable to direct manipulation of the environment of protein production because it is an open system (Figure 1).",
              "In some cases higher protein titers can be achieved using CFPS because all energy in the system is channeled toward producing the protein of interest (Figure 2) [6].",
              "Moreover, CFPS reactions are flexible in their setup, allowing users to utilize a variety of reaction formats, such as batch, continuous flow, and continuous exchange, in order to achieve the desired protein titer (Figure 3).",
              "These advantages make CFPS optimally suited for applications such as the production of difficult-to-synthesize proteins, large proteins, proteins encoded by high GC content genes, membrane proteins, and virus-like particles (Figure 4A and Figure 5A).",

              "The vessel choice may also depend on the growth scale desired.",
              "Lastly, cell cultures must be harvested, which is typically done via centrifugation and washing of the pelleted cells.",
              "Platforms that stand out most due to specialized methods are wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte.",
              "In general, all other platforms utilize cell growth in liquid culture, centrifugation for the harvest of cells, and pellet washing in an HEPES-based buffer supplemented with acetate salts and with DTT in some cases.",
              "However, for wheat germ, wheat seeds are ground in a mill and sieved, and embryos are selected by solvent flotation [194].",
              "Rabbit reticulocyte extract preparation may even require treatment of live rabbits to make them anemic as well as bleeding of the rabbits to obtain the cells needed [98].",
              "Extract preparation consists of pre-lysis preparation, lysis, and post-lysis processing, which are covered in detail for each high adoption platform in Table 2.",
              "Lysis methods not only vary from platform to platform, but many different lysis methods can also be used for a single platform.",
              "Here we have highlighted just one of the methods used for each platform, but others may also be viable.",
              "Firstly, cells are resuspended, then sonication (E.",

              "The Chinese hamster ovary, HeLa, and rabbit platforms are generally treated with micrococcal nuclease to degrade remaining endogenous mRNA in the extract, and the nuclease activity is quenched through addition of EGTA.",
              "All extracts are then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored either in liquid nitrogen, or more frequently at \u221280 \u00b0C if CFPS is not immediately performed afterwards.",
              "CFPS reaction setup requires mixing of many reagents to initiate protein synthesis, and the details of setup for each high adoption platform are covered in Table 3.",
              "There are two main differences among CFPS setups: the chosen energy system and whether the reaction is coupled or uncoupled.",
              "Otherwise, the reaction components are generally the same, with two unique reagents used for each platform and slight variations in concentration from platform to platform.",
              "Common reagents include ATP, GTP, UTP, CTP, tRNA, HEPES, Mg salts, K salts, 20 amino acids, and energy rich molecules.",
              "Most platforms use a creatine phosphate/creatine kinase energy system, and the most work has been done in E.",
              "coli to enable more inexpensive energy systems, such as PEP, glucose, and maltodextrin [8,197].",
              "Reaction temperature has also been a major point of optimization for each of these platforms, with typical temperatures ranging from 21 to 37 \u00b0C among the various platforms [17,195,198] (Table 2).",
              "In terms of reaction type, coupled reactions are desirable because of the ease of setup, but uncoupled reactions are typically used for eukaryotic platforms to improve yields (see Section 2.",
              "2, titled \u201cCoupled and Uncoupled Formats\u201d) [28].",
              "Uncoupled reactions require an in vitro transcription reaction often catalyzed by T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP), followed by mRNA purification, then a cell-free translation reaction utilizing the prepared lysate, and are both more time-consuming and more difficult in terms of handling.",
              "Platforms that generally utilize uncoupled reactions include wheat germ, rabbit reticulocyte, insect, and HeLa.",
              "Transcription for most platforms that utilize coupled reactions require T7RNAP, but some platforms, such as E.",
              "coli are able to employ solely the endogenous polymerase [199,200].",
              "Overall, wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte are the most time-consuming preparations, at 4\u20135 days for wheat germ and up to 9 days for rabbit, if treatment of animals is needed.",
              "All other platforms hover around the 1\u20132 day mark for preparation, with highly variable growth times dependent on doubling time for the strain and final cell density desired for harvest.",
              "E.",
              "coli requires the least time for preparation from the initiation of culture growth to the final freezing of extract due to its quick doubling time and relatively simple extract preparation procedure.",
              "A variety of internal development of the CFPS platforms is constantly occurring in order to improve protein yields and streamline extract preparation.",
              "Some major advances have greatly improved a variety of the CFPS platforms, such as internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), species-independent translational leaders (SITS), and 5\u2032UTR optimization.",
              "These have improved the rates of translation in eukaryotic platforms, which can limit protein yield.",
              "5\u2032UTRs are used to mimic cap structures and promote binding of the ribosome to the mRNA template, but in some cases they have also been found to be unhelpful or even detrimental to productivity.",
              "Additionally, 5\u2032UTR choice may require some testing and optimization before application [6,11,19,202].",
              "IRESs are sequences utilized by viruses to hijack cellular machinery for replication.",
              "They have been added to CFPS templates in order to bypass translation initiation factors, but many are species-dependent.",
              "However, IRESs have been used in rabbit reticulocyte, Chinese hamster ovary, yeast, and Leishmania tarentolae [64,203,204,205].",
              "SITS are unstructured translation leaders that allow transcribed mRNA to interact directly with ribosomes across a variety of CFPS platforms from many cell types, such that translation initiation factors are not needed [11,190,193].",
              "Codon optimization of the template DNA has also been used to improve yields in eukaryotic platforms [73].",
              "In addition to template optimization, many high adoption platforms have undergone optimization of cell-free reaction reagent concentrations through systematic titrations of the main reagents [197,206].",
              "Additionally, protein yields can be augmented by the addition of purified transcriptional and translational components or molecular crowding agents [207,208].",
              "This review is aimed at helping new users of CFPS platforms determine which platform best suits their needs.",
              "We sought to highlight similarities and differences among the platforms, the applications that can be achieved by each, and the reasons one platform may be more advantageous for a certain goal than another.",
              "We recommend new users first investigate the high adoption platforms to find one that suits them, as these platforms have been best optimized and there is plentiful literature to support the user.",

              "These applications include education, post-translational modifications, high-throughput expression, virus-like particles production, large-scale synthesis, membrane proteins, difficult-to-synthesize proteins (antibodies, large proteins, ice-structuring proteins, and metalloproteins), and miscellaneous applications (studies of translational machinery, genetic code expansion, metabolic engineering, and genetic circuits).",
              "In addition, we have covered the methods for growth, extract preparation, and cell-free reaction setup, as well as batch reaction protein yield, such that the reader can further determine if the platform suits their needs and obtain a better understanding of what is required for successful implementation of each.",
              "We also briefly covered the applications enabled by low adoption platforms including Neurospora crassa, Streptomyces, Vibrio natriegens, Bacillus subtilis, tobacco, Arabidopsis, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus megaterium, Archaea, and Leishmania tarentolae.",
              "While these platforms have some work supporting their use, they have generally been used by only a few and are not as well optimized.",

              "Thus, a vaccine that could induce sterilizing immunity in the upper respiratory tract would be preferable to stop virus spread.",
              "Live attenuated vaccines or viral vectors that can be administered intranasally, would probably also lead to a strong mucosal immune response as well as an IgG response.",
              "Alas, very few vaccines that are appropriate for intranasal administration are undergoing development and none have made it to the clinical trials yet [11].",
              "The next ethical question is, what will be the effect of the vaccine on older individuals who are at higher risk from COVID-19?",
              "According to Sinovac\u2019s inactivated vaccine and Pfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccine, the effect of the vaccine in older individuals is less compared to younger adults.",
              "Thus, there is a need for different vaccine formulation or a booster dose to improve immune responses in older individuals [11].",
              "The children usually show increased reactogenicity compared to adults.",
              "As many CVCs have fairly strong adverse effects, low-dose vaccines might be required for children, particularly for AdV and mRNA-based vaccines.",
              "Pfizer has considered this approach and accordingly reduced the reactogenicity of its mRNA vaccine in older adults, making it appropriate for children [11].",
              "There is also risk of vaccine enhanced disease for inactivated vaccine candidates (VAERD) that need to be considered.",
              "The higher numbers of antibodies are unable to neutralize the virus in case of high viral load, resulting in VAERD.",
              "Furthermore, ADE has been observed with other coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and could be a risk for CVCs.",
              "ADE occurs when antibodies bind to the virus and the resulting antibody-virus complex facilitates viral entry by host macrophages instead of neutralizing the virus.",
              "However, when there is an urgent need for CVCs globally, being concerned and assessing such risks should not prevent the release of otherwise safe and effective vaccines to the public [60].",
              "If there is an incidence of the adverse reaction, there should be programs in place to safeguard proper medical treatment and compensation is provided to affected individuals and records are kept for re-evaluating the safety of the vaccine(s).",
              "The accountable authorities should also ensure that an effective and fair policy is in place, for instances where vaccination is compulsory, so the public trust in the health care system is not risked.",
              "Pre-existing immunity to adenoviruses is a concern, specifically for those vaccine candidates utilizing human adenoviruses such as CanSino\u2019Ad5 vaccine, as it may lead to a decreased immune response to the vaccine.",
              "AstraZeneca/Oxford\u2019s AZD is another adenovirus-based vaccine candidate, but instead of utilizing adenovirus derived from humans, it utilizes a genetically modified chimpanzee-derived adenovirus.",
              "This effectively eliminates the concern about pre-existing immunity and thus, averts the negative impact on the immune response generated to the vaccine [60].",
              "Although some vaccines are approved through EUA, long-term data on vaccine safety is also crucial.",
              "The well-known case of Dengue vaccine should not be overlooked, where dengue vaccine protected individuals against virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) and severe VCD for 5 years, who had exposure to dengue prior to vaccination.",
              "There was also a higher risk of VCD and severe VCD in vaccinated individuals who were not exposed to dengue earlier [61].",
              "Thus, to avert such obstacles after vaccination, even after EUA approval, long-term safety and efficacy data is essential.",
              "Furthermore, if a vaccine is approved for use but subsequently it is found to be not as effective as expected in the population, it could lead to a loss of trust in the vaccines.",
              "There are reports of few adverse effects with the Pfizer vaccine (Table \u200b(Table3)3) [62\u201364] and these recent adverse reactions were confirmed by the Finnish Medicines Agency Filmea, Finland [65].",
              "Thus, when an effective vaccine is launched, fewer people may be inclined to accept it, which in turn can lead to further worsening of the pandemic and a decline in the confidence in already approved and effective vaccines against infections.",
              "Hence, it is vital to building trust in the public health system by being completely transparent and reporting accurate data in a timely fashion [61].",
              "Thus, the ideal characteristics of CVCs described by WHO are important to consider while developing vaccines (Table \u200b(Table3)3) [66, 67].",
              "Few mild side effects of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that should not last more than a week [60\u201362] and Ideal COVID-19 vaccine characteristics according to WHO [64, 65] Manufacturers have a valuable share in the vaccine supply chain as their credibility rest on the effectiveness of their vaccines.",
              "The risks of poorly performing supply chains are detrimental for the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, with potential consequences for future supply in case of adverse events [68].",
              "Manufacturers from developing countries are disparate in nature and are either privately or state-owned [68].",
              "To ensure that the threat of COVID-19 is eliminated, it is critical that a coordinated and cooperative approach is taken.",
              "This includes collaboration between several international organizations to safeguard sufficient financing and fair distribution of the vaccine supply.",
              "The organizations such as Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN), The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI), Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and WHO are working in tandem to overcome this epidemic.",

              "Nonetheless, details about the capability for quality control, supply chain and delivery abilities must to be closely assessed [69].",
              "To progress the supply chain, an expert group of representatives of DCVMN prioritized three main areas as Traceability in the context of global digital health initiatives, amassing in the context of addressing vaccine shortages, stock-outs, outbreaks and epidemic prevention, and new packaging technologies.",

              "In the past, platforms based on nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA have not resulted in a successful vaccine for human diseases and so, it is yet to be seen how mRNA vaccines that are temperature-sensitive may pose difficulties for scaling up production.",
              "Moreover, for DNA vaccines, its dependence on electroporation or an injector delivery device for vaccine administration is a probable concern.",
              "Although, electroporation is considered to be a safe procedure and is vital to generate an enhanced immune response, it can complicate the vaccine delivery [60].",

              "From January 2020 to the beginning of second quarter of 2021, the intensity and rapidity of SARS-CoV-2 transmission have led to about 150,000,000 cases and more than 3,000,000 deaths in the world putting considerable pressure on public health systems and the global economy.",
              "In the context of extraordinary scientific and technical mobilization, the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was published on January 11th 2020, triggering intense global Research and Development (R&D) activity to develop a vaccine against this disease.",
              "To date, World Health Organization (WHO) lists about 200 vaccine candidates in preclinical development, 100 in clinical evaluation and 13 received authorization [1].",
              "In Europe, 4 vaccines have already been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and several mass vaccination campaigns are also underway worldwide.",
              "These rapid developments have been made possible by the important contribution of both public and private funding, high level of volunteers\u2019 participation in clinical trials as well as by changes in the review process of regulatory agencies [2].",
              "On the other hand, the success of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine platform is probably the consequence of previous researches for more than 15 years and their previous identification as vaccine platform of choice for emerging infectious diseases [3].",
              "Since the mechanisms of action and undesirable effects of these vaccines are addressed in other articles of this special issue, we will focus on the efficacy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, more particularly on the four vaccines already available in Europe.",
              "In the last decade, there was a marked evolution of vaccine platforms including the development of nucleic acid-based vaccine candidates and vectored vaccines, a number of approaches that have been used to accelerate COVID-19 vaccines elaboration.",
              "Moreover, previous preclinical data from vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) enabled the initial step of exploratory vaccine design to be largely overlooked, saving a considerable amount of time.",
              "In most cases, production processes were also adapted from those of existing vaccines [2].",
              "As a result, a first phase I clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 began in March 2020 testing the mRNA 1273 (Moderna) [4].",
              "In April 2020, another phase I trial testing different sequences of the mRNA BNT 162 (BioNTech/Pfizer) has also begun [5] then followed by adenovirus vectored vaccines, in June and July 2020, respectively ChAdOx1nCov-19 (AstraZeneca/Oxford) and Ad26COVS1 (Janssen) [6], [7].",
              "One important particularity of this period was that clinical phases were overlapping and trial starts were staggered, with initial phase I/II trials followed by fast progression to phase III trials mainly considering interim analysis of the phase I/II data.",
              "Most of the manufacturers had also rapidly started the large-scale commercial production of vaccines despite the absence of any result from phase III trials [2].",
              "Finally, both Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EMA implemented a rolling review process, which means that a drug company can submit completed sections of its new drug application for review, rather than waiting until every section of the application is completed before the entire application can be reviewed.",
              "Beyond these exceptional adaptations, one of the key factors of the accelerated development of COVID-19 vaccines was financial risk-taking that was greatly sustained by public funds, namely in Germany, UK and USA.",
              "Nonetheless, it should be underlined that despite these financial considerations but also the pandemic-associated emergency, no concession was made on safety.",
              "While phase I trials are usually designed to determine the safety profile at several dosages of a drug candidate, in the field of vaccines, the immunogenicity as a marker of drug-response is also evaluated.",
              "Indeed, this evaluation constitutes an essential step in the construction of future trials.",
              "In this context, phase II trials are intended to more precisely evaluate immunogenicity in relation to dose regimen in the way to determine the final dose to use in phase III trials.",
              "Here, most of the published studies were combined phase I/II trials aiming to determine safety and immunogenicity including the effect of a second vaccine dose according to different dosages and intervals [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].",
              "Phase I studies usually recruited a low number of subjects but during the early development of COVID-19 vaccines at least one study reported here included about 200 volunteers [5] and according to a phase II design, another study included more than 500 subjects [6].",
              "Such an important recruitment clearly helped to provide stronger results and has probably facilitated the design of phase III studies.",
              "This large number of subjects also allowed to strengthen the excellent results about safety profile of these vaccine candidates whatever the platform used namely mRNA or adenoviral vector [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].",
              "As summarized in Table 1 , all the vaccine candidates reported here were able to induce an immune response against the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2.",
              "Thus, there was a clear dose- or time-dependent increased in both specific Ig-G and neutralizing antibody titers (Table 1) which are enhanced by the second dose of vaccine [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].",
              "Some differences regarding Ig-G and neutralizing antibody titers may be discussed between these vaccines but it is important to point out that the assays used to perform these measures vary greatly and then comparisons must be made with caution.",
              "Nevertheless, an increase in specific Ig-G and neutralizing antibody titers has been shown in 90 to 100% of subjects while cellular responses were also observed.",
              "The phase I study on Ad26COVS1 vaccine also brings more details about immune response by analyzing the binding and functional profiles of vaccine-elicited antibodies by systems serology analyses.",

              "These studies demonstrated both antigen-binding Ig-G and virus-neutralizing responses in older adults but also a possible decrease in such responses with increasing age [5], [6].",
              "Nevertheless, an elderly-dedicated phase I study showed that mRNA 1273 vaccine induces a good Ig-G response against the spike-protein as well as significative neutralizing antibody titers in adults older than 70 years of age [8].",
              "Taken as a whole, these results suggested the possibility to demonstrate COVID-19 vaccines\u2019 efficacy in phase III trials.",
              "One of the main issues of phase III trials, particularly in the case of a new pathology, is to define the primary criterion to be used as efficacy markers as well as to define the level of efficacy that will be considered as pertinent.",
              "Undeniably, the definition of the primary criterion strongly impacts both the conduct of the trial and the future modalities of prescription of the vaccine.",
              "On June 2020, the FDA has released a guidance document for the development and licensure of COVID-19 vaccines [9].",
              "This document stated that symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 might be an acceptable primary endpoint for a COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trial with an efficacy level of at least 50% required.",
              "Moreover, other secondary criteria might be used to determine the possible efficacy on asymptomatic or severe infections.",
              "As a consequence, study sample sizes and timing of interim analyses had to be based on the statistical success criteria for primary and secondary efficacy analyses and realistic, data-driven estimates of vaccine efficacy and incidence of COVID-19 for the populations and locales in which the trials are conducted [9].",
              "According to these conditions, phase III studies have been conducted in countries where the virus spread was extremely high and have included in a few months several tens of thousands of subjects [10], [11], [12], [13].",
              "According to these studies and except unwanted effects related to usual reactogenicity, these vaccines appear safe.",
              "As summarized in Table 2 , among the four vaccines already authorized in Europe the overall efficacy defined as reduction of symptomatic COVID-19 varies from 67% to 95% [10], [11], [12], [13].",
              "These results are largely greater than the minimum efficacy level of 50% required by the FDA [9].",
              "Furthermore, these levels of efficacy are also similar or even higher than that the mean 60% observed with the influenza vaccines [14].",
              "It should be underlined that mRNA vaccines [10], [11] appear to have a higher efficacy than that of adenoviral vectored vaccines [12], [13].",
              "Nevertheless, a definitive conclusion about any comparisons should be done with caution.",
              "The complexity of the design of ChAdOx1nCov-19 vaccine phase III study does not facilitate neither the interpretation nor any comparisons of data.",
              "On the other hand, regarding interim analyses of trials reported in the Table 2, the protection against severe infection appears to be close to 100% for all vaccines but not for Ad26COVS1 vaccine where data recently published show protection against severe infection with one dose of vaccine of only 77% [13].",
              "It remains to determine how this result is only representative of this vaccine rather than may be finally observed with all other COVID-19 vaccines when long-term follow-up data will be available.",

              "Concerning mortality, the studies have not been designed to answer this question, it may then be difficult to bring clear and conclusive result.",
              "Moreover, according to the drastic reduction of severe infections observed in vaccinated-people, these studies are probably under-powered to clearly demonstrate the effect of vaccines on mortality.",
              "Regarding elderly, not all published phase III studies had included many elderly people but in studies with a significant number of elderly participants (Table 2), the efficacy level remains relatively close to the one observed in younger subjects (86.",

              "Indeed, as summarized in Table 3 , at least 4 studies that had included 20,000 to more than 1,300,000 vaccinated people provide us impressive results on symptomatic or asymptomatic infections, severe infections as well as on mortality [17], [18], [19], [20].",

              "Israel was probably the country which developed the most rapid and extensive mass vaccination campaign in the world by using the BNT 162 b2 vaccine.",
              "All people recorded on the Clalit Health Services (53% of Israeli population) who were newly vaccinated during the period from December 20, 2020, to February 1, 2021, were matched to unvaccinated controls according to demographic and clinical characteristics leading to 2 study groups of 596,618 persons each [17].",
              "Looking on results 7 days or more after the second dose of vaccine, symptomatic and asymptomatic as well as severe COVID-19 infections are reduced by 92%.",
              "Mortality was also reduced by 84% when regarding 21 to 27 days after the first dose [17].",
              "Even if such results have to be strengthened by a longer-term follow-up, the present study also provides informations about a similar vaccine effectiveness across different age groups and a slightly lower effectiveness among patients with multiple coexisting pathological conditions [17].",
              "In another paper under review, similar results are provided with the Mayo Clinic Health Database showing a 90% decrease in the development of a symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection after BNT 162 b2 or mRNA 1273 vaccination in 31 609 persons [18].",
              "Same kind of results are also provided by both Scotland and England data where both BNT 162 b2 and ChAdOx1nCov-19 vaccines were largely used with evidence of 85% decrease in symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and about 90% decrease in severe infections (Table 3) [19], [20].",
              "Interestingly, in the Scottish study, such results were observed while the vaccines were administered at only one dose to extend the number of subjects receiving at least one dose of vaccine.",
              "Besides the fact that all these data confirm the results of phase III clinical trials, they also help to discuss the question of the effect of vaccine on virus transmission.",
              "Because asymptomatic infections are also reduced, it may be that virus transmission is decreased.",
              "Moreover, a recently published paper brings supplemental arguments about an effect of vaccines on transmission.",
              "Indeed, people who develop a COVID-19 despite vaccination with the BNT 162 b2 vaccine have a clear reduction of viral load that might help to break the spread of the virus [21].",
              "Complementary strategies, such as vaccines able to develop mucosal immunity are also under development [22].",
              "One of the first questions on hold is the duration of the protection afforded by the vaccination.",
              "According to studies follow-up duration, it might be supposed that this protection is as at least 6 to 12 months.",
              "This duration will determine the need of a new vaccine boost and possibly the need of annual boost.",
              "Some large population-based studies using test-negative designs might help to evaluate these different issues particularly the situations of vaccine failure [23].",
              "The question of using different vaccines than the one use initially is also crucial.",
              "New studies should be designed including studies for the evaluation of the impact of immunogenicity against adenoviral vector if such a vaccine is used for a third injection.",
              "Because phase III clinical studies provide no or only few data about immunogenicity, it remains important to also designed studies able to determine more precisely the immune response according to real life administration scheme namely regarding the role of both cellular and innate immunity.",
              "Actually, in France, 2 studies are in course to answer such questions by using BNT 162 b2 or mRNA 1273 vaccines in adults including a sub-population of elderly people over 75 years of age.",
              "Besides older people, the question of the efficacy of vaccines in particular populations is also crucial.",
              "Several recently published studies bring some answers.",
              "To date, there is only few data about the efficacy of vaccine in young people under 18 years of age [10].",
              "Studies evaluating COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in young people aged 12 to 16 years are actually in course but both FDA and EMA have already beenquestioned to provide an authorization of use.",
              "On the other hand, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines seem to generate robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women [24].",
              "In this study, vaccine-induced immune responses were also significantly greater than the response to natural infection and immune transfer to neonates occurred via placenta and breastmilk [24].",
              "Other data also suggest that a single dose of mRNA vaccine elicits rapid immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive participants, with post-vaccination antibody titers similar to or exceeding titers found in seronegative participants who received two vaccinations [25].",
              "On the other hand, the immunization rate among kidney transplant recipients who received 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine can be as low as 48% [26].",
              "Very low immune response is evidenced also in others immunocompromised populations.",
              "The issue of a third vaccine dose in these non-responsive patients is an intriguing one that will be usefully explored in further research.",
              "In this context, a large cohort has been opened in France (COV-POPART) to evaluate the immune response in a number of particular populations including patients with cancer, transplant recipients as well as patients with auto-immune disease receiving immune-modulator treatments.",
              "Last, an important challenge also concerns the efficacy of vaccines regarding the emergence of viral variants [27].",
              "We have previously described some data from clinical trials regarding the decrease or the absence of efficacy of the ChAdOx1nCov-19 namely on B.",

              "8 Vaccine performance is highly context dependent, influenced by population risk of infection and disease, so assessment is required among multiple different subgroups.",

              "The need to evaluate different covid-19 vaccines against multiple endpoints and variants in a range of subgroups means that effectiveness studies will be a staple of public health and academic workload for the foreseeable future.",
              "We need to ensure that methodological approaches such as test negative case-control designs can be delivered through common protocols using routine, quality controlled, health and surveillance data systems. Harmonisation will minimise the proliferation of expensive bespoke studies with individualised designs requiring different approaches to data collection and ethical approval, thereby protecting scarce resources for other public health priorities.",
              "Additionally, as countries reach high levels of vaccine coverage and case rates fall, case-control designs will become more challenging.",
              "9 Alternative approaches such as cohort studies offer opportunities to explore indirect effects of vaccination, including herd protection, and the effects of covid-19 vaccines on non-specific outcomes, such as absenteeism from work or school and symptoms such as gastrointestinal illness.",

              "1011 Ultimately, vaccine effectiveness studies are only as good as the data available, and measures to capture high quality, timely data must be prioritised, particularly in low and middle income countries where disease burdens are high and systems for routine data collection can be suboptimal.",
              "Since covid-19 vaccines were authorised for use on accelerated regulatory pathways with comparatively little supportive clinical data, robust and timely real world safety data are critical to inform risk, minimise harm, and maintain public confidence.",
              "This was recently highlighted in the context of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine by the paucity of accurate data on background rates of thromboembolic events to inform the response to an emerging safety signal.",
              "1213 In some countries, vaccines are offered to most of the population, including both high risk individuals and those targeted primarily because of their role in transmission.",

              "17 Nevertheless, considering that severe covid-19 is less common in children than in adults, it is imperative that rigorous long term safety and effectiveness studies are conducted in children to quantify risk-benefit balance and inform vaccine policy and choices.",
              "The success of any vaccine programme depends on the quality of real world evaluations.",

              "5% in our second group.",
              "Because of the difference in vaccination rates between both periods, in the half of our second group, the time from vaccination may be assumed as 4 months or shorter in the period of Omicron variant surge.",
              "The vaccination status was judged based on the same criteria shown in Materials and Methods during both periods.",
              "Hence, direct evidence of declined long-term VE in the second group was not assessed.",
              "Although the immunogenicity to the Omicron variant following two mRNA vaccine doses has not been reported, reduced immunogenicity was assumed due to observed mutation of the targeted epitope.",
              "Because the time from vaccination was not fully assessed during Omicron surge, not only long-time passage from vaccination but also lower immunogenicity against Omicron variant may have contributed to the low VE of mRNA vaccines in this period.",
              "Although the persons who had a history of COVID-19 were less than ten in second group, the possibilities that these persons may have led to an underestimate of the infection rate and influenced the VE were not excluded.",
              "The actual test-positive rate (70%) and the vaccination rate (90%) during this period were higher than the rates assumed by us for sample size estimation, and therefore more participants may have been needed to obtain a more accurate estimate of the VE.",
              "Notably, lower specificity of laboratory tests may also have contributed to the underestimation of VE.",
              "In order to compensate for the lack of social resources of PCR tests that existed during the period of Omicron variant surge, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare stipulated that COVID-19 may be diagnosed based on private rapid antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection, instead of authentic PCRs.",
              "Therefore, the effect exerted by inaccurate test-positive cases diagnosed using positive rapid antigen tests on our study cannot be excluded, because 50 test-positive cases were based on these positive rapid antigen tests.",
              "Thus, the lower specificity of rapid antigen tests may have led to an underestimation of VE.",
              "Several limitations deemed to have affected this study.",
              "First, selection bias cannot be excluded.",
              "The participants of this study may not represent the entire COVID-19 population in Japan, because the majority of our participants were mild cases presenting in a single center ambulatory setting.",
              "Second, the time from vaccination was not fully assessed during the period of Omicron variant surge;",
              "hence, direct evidence of declined long-term VE in the second group was not assessed.",
              "Third, lower specificity of the self-test kits adopted for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 during the period of Omicron variant surge may have influenced the VE because of the nature of the test-negative design.",
              "Fourth, genotyping of the virus was not performed for the test-positive cases, resulting in the VE not reflecting a direct preventive effect against either the Delta variant or the Omicron variant during each period.",
              "Fifth, there deemed to be several other confounders, such as comorbidities and previous history of COVID-19 in the participants.",
              "There were incomplete descriptions concerning the comorbidities because of the retrospective review of medical records.",
              "Hence, the comorbidities of the participants were not adopted for the analysis.",
              "Also, the possibilities that previous history of COVID-19 influenced the VE could not be excluded.",
              "Despite the abovementioned limitations, our results have shown that BTN162b2 and mRNA-1273 are capable of exerting the expected preventive effect on the all COVID-19 infection besides moderate-to-severe disease only during the period of Delta variant predominance, and also demonstrated that these preventive effects on the Japanese population were susceptible to waning during the period of Omicron variant surge.",
              "To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to evaluate the VE during the both periods of Delta variant predominance and Omicron variant surg using the test-negative design;",
              "this method is considered to be as accurate as the randomized control trial (RCT) method, and therefore useful for understanding VE during a pandemic situation.",

              "mRNA Vaccines for Infectious Diseases Beyond COVID-19 - Penn Medicine",
              "News Blog COVID-19 vaccines have quickly come to the rescue.",
              "Scientists created a vaccine to prevent the new virus using foundational research and mRNA technology developed at Penn.",
              "Today, as we race to vaccinate more people in more places against COVID-19, the biology behind these vaccines is poised to change the world again.",
              "With the promise of a whole new class of other MRNA vaccines based on the same mRNA mechanism used for COVID-19, the story of this novel treatment continues at Penn where researchers and labs are investigating other infectious diseases, including influenza, herpes and other sexually transmitted infections, that could be prevented with an effective mRNA vaccine.",
              "The vaccine uses messenger RNA, or mRNA, to instruct the body to produce specific proteins called spike proteins.",
              "These proteins look similar to those of the virus, and this antigen triggers the body\u2019s immune system to create specific antibodies that can fight off the real virus should the body become exposed.",
              "Drew Weissman, MD, PhD, and Katalin Kariko\u0301, PhD, helped pave the way for the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna with their 2005 mRNA discoveries.",
              "\u201cThere are a few crucial benefits of using mRNA vaccines versus other types of vaccines,\u201d said Weissman, a professor of Infectious Diseases at the Perelman School of Medicine.",
              "Weissman points out that mRNA vaccines are both easier to make and may be more effective than other types of vaccines.",
              "As seen with the COVID-19 vaccine, it\u2019s possible to construct other mRNA vaccines quickly: \u201cmRNA vaccines are essentially plug and play.",
              "We believe you can change the part of the mRNA that encodes a protein, plugging in new code specific to the virus we hope to protect against, and cause one\u2019s body to produce proteins that match that virus\u2019 proteins.",
              "We do not have to develop and manufacture an entirely new formula.",
              "\u201d Another benefit is the speed at which mRNA vaccines can be made.",
              "With other vaccine types, like live attenuated vaccines (think measles, mumps, rubella vaccine) or inactivated vaccines (think flu and polio vaccines), actual pathogens must be transported and replicated during the manufacturing process, Weissman said.",
              "\u201cThis equates to faster production, which is important should a new infectious disease pop up that we need to quickly protect ourselves against.",
              "\u201d Both clinical trials and real-world studies investigating the capabilities of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have shown enormous efficacy.",
              "The likelihood of contracting COVID-19 if you\u2019ve been fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine is less than 10 percent, Weissman said.",
              "And the latest data says that if you do catch COVID-19, your symptoms will not be severe enough to require hospitalization.",
              "\u201cThat level of protection is far greater than many other vaccines for other diseases,\u201d Weissman said.",
              "James Eberwine, PhD, a professor of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics at Penn whose work largely focuses on foundational and basic research related to neurobiology, has been a long-time believer in mRNA\u2019s promise.",
              "\u201cWe saw that if you put the RNA from cell A into cell B, then cell B will become cell A,\u201d Eberwine explained of experiments in his lab from decades ago.",
              "\u201cRNA and mRNAs have a figurative cellular memory and a literal transformational quality.",
              "\u201d Eberwine\u2019s work to understand how translating different RNA molecules into proteins affects different cells dates back to 27 years ago at Penn, before Weissman and Kariko\u0301\u2019s groundbreaking research.",
              "Eberwine and his colleagues were the first to \u201ctransfect\u201d RNA into cells when they put RNA into a region of a neuron to determine what the protein made from that RNA did in that region of the neuron.",
              "Although the current mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines each instruct the body to make only one type of spike protein, Eberwine believes that the benefit of mRNA vaccines lies in their ability to be crafted to create several different proteins within the body, and those proteins in turn would lead to antibodies that target various aspects of invading viruses;",
              "ultimately, that means the body has different weapons to attack threatening viruses.",
              "Among other things, he and his lab are working on developing better ways to see the shape of viral and other disease-related proteins by making solution-based protein structures rather than crystal structures.",
              "That will lead to a clearer picture of what regions of mRNA are most effective and useful as building blocks of cellular therapies and vaccines.",
              "Vaccines for many other diseases beyond COVID-19 are already in the works.",
              "Below is a quick look at just some of the mRNA research happening at Penn to fight infectious diseases.",
              "The most common sexually-transmitted disease (STD), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is a non-curable disease that can be painful, can increase risk of other infections (like HIV), and can be fatal to the newborns and fetuses of mothers infected with the virus.",
              "Another danger of the disease: HSV-2 is often undetected.",
              "\u201cHSV-2 affects mental and emotional health, too,\u201d said Harvey Friedman, MD, a professor of Infectious Diseases and a HSV researcher.",
              "\u201cThose with the disease have to worry about passing it to others and engaging in sexual relationships.",
              "And while there are treatments and ways to limit spreading the disease to sexual partners, there are no current treatments that make it completely safe to have sex with someone who has HSV-2.",
              "\u201d In order to address the many different negative impacts of HSV-2, Friedman, Weissman, and their colleagues are developing an mRNA HSV-2 vaccine.",

              "As a solution, many researchers have learned to alter certain chemical features of the mRNA transcript to make it less attractive to nucleases.",
              "For example, Juozas S\u030ciurkus, senior R&D manager at Thermo Fisher Scientific, notes that his company offers reagents that allow researchers to modulate the length of the polyadenine tail found at the 3\u2019 end of every mRNA transcript.",
              "\u201cThese [changes] can define the half-life of the mRNA,\u201d S\u030ciurkus notes.",

              "A carefully modulated response Even if researchers can enhance mRNA stability, they still have to contend with its immunogenicity.",
              "Because many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, rely on RNA rather than DNA as their genomic material, the human immune system frequently perceives foreign RNA as a threat.",
              "\u201cDifferent RNA sequences can trigger different levels of activation,\u201d explains Dong.",
              "\u201cMaybe there's cytokine release or recruitment of different immune cells, but it can be quite a severe response.",
              "\u201d In recent years, researchers have learned that the strategic substitution of certain nucleotides at the mRNA synthesis stage can dampen this effect.",

              "Such substitutions can mute the immune response while also bolstering the stability of the mRNA and the efficiency of translation.",
              "Thermo Fisher Scientific offers a variety of such modified nucleotides as part of its TheraPure product family.",
              "While such modifications can reduce adverse events from mRNA administration, Dong notes that there are some instances where immunogenicity is an advantage.",
              "For example, his group is developing a cancer therapy based on mRNA that encodes an immunity-stimulating cytokine.",
              "He has found that the innate immune response to the mRNA itself can actually deliver an efficacy boost.",
              "\u201cThat's very helpful to remove the primary tumour and also establish whole-body anti-tumour immunity,\u201d Dong says.",
              "A similar effect could be beneficial for vaccines, where the mRNA molecule itself primes the immune system to respond more potently against the antigenic protein that it encodes.",

              "Indeed, the first RNA-based drug to win US Food & Drug Administration approval, Alnylam\u2019s Onpattro, is formulated via encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles, which enable efficient delivery to the liver.",
              "Thermo Fisher Scientific also offers its own lipid nanoparticle-based reagent system, Invivofectamine Rx, for the encapsulation and delivery of therapeutic mRNAs.",
              "Sahay, who works extensively with lipid nanoparticles, notes that these are typically formulated with a mixture of four different lipids.",
              "These collectively facilitate the delivery of the RNA-laden particles to cell membranes and the subsequent uptake into cells via endocytosis.",
              "As a final step, the RNA cargo must be released from the endosomes responsible for nanoparticle uptake.",
              "This last step remains a significant bottleneck in the mRNA delivery process, but researchers are making steady gains in delivery efficiency.",
              "For example, Sahay says that the latest generation of lipid nanoparticles can release up to 25% of their payload into the cytosol.",
              "This still leaves behind a lot of unused mRNA, potentially necessitating larger or more frequent doses, although even a small quantity of mRNA can have a potent effect.",
              "\u201cJust a few mRNA reads can then create a lot of proteins,\u201d says Sahay, noting that he has obtained promising preclinical data from mRNA-based therapies for chronic diseases like cystic fibrosis.",
              "Once the first wave of mRNA therapies has demonstrated the technology\u2019s mettle, Sahay says he can envision a \u2018plug and play\u2019 future.",
              "Here, each new mRNA would be individually optimized for a given clinical application, and then produced and formulated for delivery by a more or less standard procedure.",

              "There are three types of mRNA vaccines: conventional mRNA, self-amplifying mRNA, and trans-amplifying mRNA [35].",
              "The conventional mRNA contains the untranslated regions (5\u2032UTR, 3\u2032UTR) and the coding region of mRNA that can be transcribed to one copy of immunogenic protein;",
              "therefore, it is called the non-amplifying or non-replicating mRNA [35].",
              "The immune response is directly proportional to the number of transcribed mRNAs, which may require a high dose of mRNA due to its unamplified behavior that could cause repeated administration of mRNA [35].",
              "The self-amplifying mRNA vaccine is a genetically modified mRNA by adding engineered replicons originating from the self-replicating RNA viruses [36,37].",
              "Both self-amplifying mRNA and trans-amplifying mRNA have 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 conserved sequence elements (CSE) [35].",
              "It is hypothesized that CSEs can regulate viral RNA synthesis in addition to their ability to attach to viral or cellular proteins [38].",
              "The main difference between self-amplifying mRNA and trans-amplifying mRNA is that the self-amplifying mRNA has non-structural proteins 1-4 (nsP 1-4) sequence, whereas the trans-amplifying mRNA requires two RNA genes to be co-delivered, the mRNA without nsP 1-4 and the mRNA that encodes nsP1-4 genes [39].",
              "Naturally, mRNA in a cell is a transcribed gene from the genomic DNA in the nucleus, and it can be translated by the ribosome in the cytoplasm to form the required protein [40].",
              "Initially, the mRNA is transcribed from genomic DNA as a primary mRNA with the aid of RNA polymerase.",
              "The primary mRNA contains exon and intron.",
              "Thereafter, further modification of the primary mRNA occurs to be converted to mature mRNA, such as splicing of primary mRNA to remove the non-coding introns, capping the 5\u2032UTR, and poly-A sequence addition at the 3\u2032 terminal [41].",
              "In mRNA vaccine technology, the mRNA is synthesized outside the human body and is subjected to be injected and crossed the cell membrane for translation in the cytoplasm.",
              "After the mRNA is transferred from the nucleus, in the case of naturally synthesized mRNA, or from the cell membrane, in the case of mRNA vaccine to the cytoplasm, the mRNA is translated to the required protein by the ribosome.",
              "In the translation process, the poly-A tail binds to the poly-A-binding protein (PABP), and the eIFs bind to the 5\u2032UTR cap to initiate the translation.",
              "The ribosome then translates each codon in the translated region of the mRNA, which consists of three nucleotides, to amino acid [42].",
              "From the mechanism of action of the mRNA translation, it is important to note that the contents of the synthesized mRNA vaccine that contains 5\u2032 cap, 5\u2032UTR, translated region, 3\u2032UTR, and poly-A tail to be recognized by the ribosome for successful translation of mRNA to the required antigen [43].",
              "The main advantage of using mRNA compared to the plasmid DNA (pDNA) vaccine is that the pDNA requires further steps by internalizing inside the cell nucleus and transcribing into the required mRNA successfully before the translation step to the protein of interest [44].",
              "Several physiological barriers hinder the delivery of the synthesized RNA.",
              "One of the main barriers preventing RNA delivery is crossing the cell membrane and escaping from the endosomes [45].",
              "Therefore, mRNA requires a delivery carrier which will be explained in detail in the next section (Section 3).",
              "In the conventional mRNA, the open reading frames (ORFs) encode the antigen that can be translated to the antigen of interest, such as a virus epitope, which causes an immunogenic reaction that will lead to the recognition of the actual pathogen when the vaccinated subject gets infected with it [40].",
              "Figure 1 illustrates the mechanism of immune system activation in response to mRNA administration.",
              "Mechanism of immune activation by mRNA-LNPs vaccines: Upon administration, mRNA-LNPs are internalized by immune cells, where the mRNA is released from the LNPs.",
              "The mRNA is then recognized by ribosomes, leading to the translation of antigenic proteins.",
              "These proteins are processed and degraded by proteasomes producing small peptides that then get loaded on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules and presented on the cell surface, which binds to the T cell receptor (TCR), activating CD8+ T cells to kill infected cells.",
              "The produced antigen can also be endocytosed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and further degraded by the lysosomes producing small peptides that then get loaded on major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules for recognition by CD4+ T cells, which subsequently activate both the cellular immune responses by secreting inflammatory cytokines and the humoral immune responses by activating B cells.",
              "The self-amplifying mRNA contains the genetic sequences responsible for the mRNA replication before the translation step, which is the CSE and the nsP 1-4 [35].",
              "The nsP1 is required for 5\u2032 capping of the viral RNA, and nsP2 can unwind the RNA duplex during replication in addition to the helicase and protease activity [46].",
              "Furthermore, nsP2 can cleave the nsP 1-4 polyprotein into its subunits (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4) [46].",
              "The nsP3 facilitates the interaction between viral and host proteins [47], while nsP4 is an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) that catalyzes the replication of RNA [39].",
              "After the self-replication of the self-amplifying mRNA into several copies, these copies will be translated into antigens that will cause a more immunogenic response than the conventional mRNA [48,49].",
              "Different approaches can enhance the stability, safety, and efficiency of mRNA vaccines.",
              "Modifying the untranslated regions of the mRNA could play a vital role in increasing its stability and, thus, its efficacy [5].",
              "Even though the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs do not have translated sequences during the translation process of mRNA, they can play a vital role in improving the stability of mRNA and protein expression from the mRNA [50,51].",
              "Both the 5\u2032 cap in the 5\u2032UTR and the poly(A) end in the 3\u2032UTR of the mRNA can regulate the translational efficiency of the mRNA [52].",
              "For instance, it was reported that anti-reverse cap analogs were modified in the 5\u2032UTR, which will enhance the translation of mRNA in comparison to the unmodified mRNA.",
              "This translation enhancement might be caused by increasing the binding affinity of the modified cap to eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) in the ribosomes [53].",
              "Additionally, it was shown that changing the mRNA cap into phosphorothioate may improve the stability and the expression of the mRNA vaccine when it is transfected in immature dendritic cells [54].",
              "Adding nucleotides to the mRNA can alter the stability and translation capacity.",
              "It was reported that inserting pseudouridine into the mRNA in mammalian cells increased the yield of the translated protein and decreased the unwanted immunogenic reaction compared to the unmodified mRNA.",
              "This could enhance both safety and efficacy by decreasing the immunogenic reaction and increasing the expression of the protein, respectively [55].",
              "Furthermore, it was demonstrated that incorporating the modified nucleosides into the mRNA could reduce or eliminate the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activation, which would enhance the safety of the mRNA vaccine by modification of its nucleosides [7].",
              "This section will address four different types of materials, i.",

              "Researchers have explored alternative methods, such as adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the low molecular weight PEI and binding it to the cyclodextrin [57].",
              "The conjugation with cyclodextrin was demonstrated to be an effective and safer approach for mRNA delivery, and it can be administered through different routes, which may lead to the production of distinct antibodies.",

              "Hyper-branched dendritic spherical dendrimers with high amine density efficiently form mRNA complexes.",
              "However, their excessive charge densities harmed cells and caused serum clumping, but these challenges could be tackled by adding PEG to their cores or disulfide linkages [61].",
              "The mRNA delivery uses pH-responsive polymers in another approach to utilize polymers, which can release the mRNA into the cells upon arrival to the cytoplasm by self-degrading due to the cytoplasmic pH [25].",
              "Amphipathic polymers containing cationic or amphipathic amine groups can also carry mRNA into the cells by electrostatically binding to the mRNA, creating nano-complexes.",
              "Generally, high molecular weight polymers, such as chitosan and PEI, need modification to improve the transfection efficacy and durability [62].",

              "While neither of the LNP-based COVID-19 mRNA vaccines contains any adjuvants, the strong cellular and humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 elicited by these vaccines might be partially attributed to the adjuvant effect of the LNP component itself.",
