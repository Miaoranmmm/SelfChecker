    "response": "That's a very interesting question. There has been a lot of scientific research on the impact of music on the human brain, and the findings suggest that music can have positive effects on our mood, productivity, and overall well-being.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by AARP, music listeners had higher scores for mental well-being and slightly reduced levels of anxiety and depression compared to people overall[^3^]. They also reported better cognitive function and learning abilities[^3^]. Music can also help people cope with stress and trauma, as it can provide solace and connection[^2^].\n\nMusic affects the brain in many ways, activating different regions that are involved in thinking, sensation, movement, and emotion[^4^]. Music can also enhance attention, memory, and prediction skills[^1^]. Music can stimulate the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is associated with pleasure and reward[^2^].\n\nTherefore, listening to or making music can be a beneficial activity for enhancing our brain health and well-being. However, the effects of music may vary depending on the type of music, the context, and the individual preferences and characteristics of the listener or performer[^2^].",

              "A recent survey on music and brain health conducted by AARP revealed some interesting findings about the impact of music on cognitive and emotional well-being: Those are pretty impressive results, to be sure.",
              "However, this 20-minute online survey has some limitations.",
              "For one, it included 3,185 US adults ages 18 and older;",
              "that is a small number if you are extrapolating to 328 million people across the country.",
              "For another, it is really a survey of people\u2019s opinions.",
              "For example, although people might report their brain health as \u201cexcellent,\u201d there was no objective measure of brain health such as an MRI scan, or even a test to measure their cognition.",
              "Lastly, even if the ratings were true, the findings are only correlations.",
              "They do not prove that, for example, it was the exposure to music as a child that led to one\u2019s improved ability to learn new things.",
              "It may be equally likely that those children brought up in more affluent households were both more likely to be exposed to music and to be given a good education that led to their being able to easily learn new things later in life.",
              "But let\u2019s assume that the results of the AARP survey are indeed true.",
              "How can music have such impressive brain effects?",
              "Although we don\u2019t know the answers for sure, developments in cognitive neuroscience over the last few years have allowed us to speculate on some possible mechanisms. Music has been shown to activate some of the broadest and most diverse networks of the brain.",
              "Of course, music activates the auditory cortex in the temporal lobes close to your ears, but that\u2019s just the beginning.",
              "The parts of the brain involved in emotion are not only activated during emotional music, they are also synchronized.",
              "Music also activates a variety of memory regions.",
              "And, interestingly, music activates the motor system.",
              "In fact, it has been theorized that it is the activation of the brain\u2019s motor system that allows us to pick out the beat of the music even before we start tapping our foot to it!",
              "Okay, so music activates just about all of the brain.",
              "Why is that so important?",
              "Well, have you ever heard the expression, \u201cIf you don\u2019t use it, you\u2019ll lose it\u201d?",

              "The reason is that the brain is efficient;",
              "it isn\u2019t going to bother keeping a brain pathway strong when it hasn\u2019t been used in many years.",
              "The brain will use the neurons in that pathway for something else.",
              "These types of changes should be intuitively obvious to you \u2014 that\u2019s why it is harder to speak that foreign language if you haven\u2019t used it in 20 years;",
              "many of the old pathways have degraded and the neurons are being used for other purposes.",
              "So just how does music promote well-being, enhance learning, stimulate cognitive function, improve quality of life, and even induce happiness?",
              "The answer is, because music can activate almost all brain regions and networks, it can help to keep a myriad of brain pathways and networks strong, including those networks that are involved in well-being, learning, cognitive function, quality of life, and happiness.",
              "In fact, there is only one other situation in which you can activate so many brain networks all at once, and that is when you participate in social activities.",

              "It\u2019s easy to do.",

              "Naltrexone is a widely prescribed drug for treating addiction disorders.",

              "However, this 20-minute online survey has some limitations.",
              "For one, it included 3,185 US adults ages 18 and older;",
              "that is a small number if you are extrapolating to 328 million people across the country.",

              "For example, although people might report their brain health as \u201cexcellent,\u201d there was no objective measure of brain health such as an MRI scan, or even a test to measure their cognition.",
              "Lastly, even if the ratings were true, the findings are only correlations.",
              "They do not prove that, for example, it was the exposure to music as a child that led to one\u2019s improved ability to learn new things.",
              "It may be equally likely that those children brought up in more affluent households were both more likely to be exposed to music and to be given a good education that led to their being able to easily learn new things later in life.",
              "But let\u2019s assume that the results of the AARP survey are indeed true.",
              "How can music have such impressive brain effects?",
              "Although we don\u2019t know the answers for sure, developments in cognitive neuroscience over the last few years have allowed us to speculate on some possible mechanisms. Music has been shown to activate some of the broadest and most diverse networks of the brain.",
              "Of course, music activates the auditory cortex in the temporal lobes close to your ears, but that\u2019s just the beginning.",
              "The parts of the brain involved in emotion are not only activated during emotional music, they are also synchronized.",
              "Music also activates a variety of memory regions.",

              "many of the old pathways have degraded and the neurons are being used for other purposes.",
              "So just how does music promote well-being, enhance learning, stimulate cognitive function, improve quality of life, and even induce happiness?",
              "The answer is, because music can activate almost all brain regions and networks, it can help to keep a myriad of brain pathways and networks strong, including those networks that are involved in well-being, learning, cognitive function, quality of life, and happiness.",
              "In fact, there is only one other situation in which you can activate so many brain networks all at once, and that is when you participate in social activities.",

              "It\u2019s easy to do.",

In one project working with survivors of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City (American Music Therapy Association, 2011), 33 music therapists provided over 7000 programs to children, adults and families.",
              "The programs were designed to reduce stress, improve coping, and process the trauma associated with the crisis by drawing on a range of techniques including musical improvisation, songwriting, singing, sharing stories, and relaxing with music.",

              "An example of implicit learning is how melodic singing ability or tonality perception schema are learned during repeated exposure \u2014 as evinced by the early right anterior negativity (ERAN) responses, which are markers of harmonic expectation violation in non-musicians and musicians alike22,23.",
              "Learning to play an instrument involves implicit learning but introduces additional top-down effects on perception and action.",

              "Importantly, experiments have shown that the brain architecture subserving precision-weighted prediction errors differs depending on which musical phenomenon \u2014 for example, melody, harmony or rhythm \u2014 is being studied.",
              "For example, a predictive coding-based analysis of the effective connectivity in a melodic oddball functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm revealed that mismatch responses are best explained by a fully connected bilateral auditory network comprising the primary auditory cortices and the planum temporale24.",
              "Here, the observed increase in excitatory connectivity from the left primary auditory cortex to the planum temporale has been interpreted as the passing of a precise prediction error from lower to higher areas of the hierarchical processing network25,26, and the observed decrease in inhibitory connectivity within the left primary auditory cortex has been viewed as a precision-related increase in the gain of the superficial pyramidal cells encoding prediction error27,28.",
              "By contrast, as discussed later, studies of the pleasurable experience of musical harmony have revealed predictive coding mechanisms including precision-weighted prediction errors29 related to emotion and reward brain networks29, whereas studies of musical groove have implicated additional motor-related areas.",

              "In this example, unpredicted auditory input is passed forward to the auditory cortex in the form of ascending prediction errors (for example, from the medial geniculate body).",
              "These prediction errors (black arrows) drive posterior expectations (for example, encoded by deep pyramidal neurons) that return descending predictions (grey arrows) to resolve \u2014 or explain away \u2014 lower-level prediction errors.",
              "At the same time, high-level expectations about the context generate predictions of precision (blue arrows) that modulate the gain of cells encoding prediction errors at the lower level (for example, superficial pyramidal cells).",
              "This enables high levels to select the prediction errors that convey the most precise or predictable information (compare with attentional selection).",
              "In short, there are two kinds of descending predictions in predictive coding: first-order prediction of content (grey arrows) and second-order predictions of context (blue arrows).",
              "Here, context is simply the precision or predictability of prediction errors.",
              "The resulting precision-weighted prediction errors therefore mediate the selection of certain lower-level features that are consistent with higher-level constructs.",

              "When you press a key on a piano keyboard, the resulting note comprises a fundamental frequency defining its pitch30 and a series of overtones that contributes to its tone quality (timbre), which distinguishes it from other instruments31,32.",
              "A large corpus of research has been devoted to the study of musical pitch, and it is now widely accepted that the brain can extract a single pitch percept from complex tones, even in the absence of the fundamental33,34.",

              "Two different piano notes may have different pitch heights but still be perceived as having the same chroma (for example, the note C in different octaves).",
              "The auditory cortices are central to pitch processing: fMRI suggests that pitch height is processed in the planum temporale posterior to the primary auditory cortex, whereas chroma change is processed in the planum polare, anterior to the primary auditory cortex35.",
              "In general, the recognition of pitch from spectrally complex sounds is thought to be handled by a ventral stream, projecting from primary auditory areas along middle and anterior regions to the inferior frontal gyrus (Fig.",

              "The smaller this integer relationship is, the more likely the notes are to be misperceived as one single sound, and this trend has been observed also in musically distant cultures58.",
              "This is tied to the experience of sound roughness59, which is thought to be related to the bandwidths of critical auditory bands linked to the inability of the basilar membrane in the cochlea to separate notes that are very close in pitch60,61.",

              "A recent survey on music and brain health conducted by AARP revealed some interesting findings about the impact of music on cognitive and emotional well-being: Those are pretty impressive results, to be sure.",
              "However, this 20-minute online survey has some limitations.",
              "For one, it included 3,185 US adults ages 18 and older;",
              "that is a small number if you are extrapolating to 328 million people across the country.",
              "For another, it is really a survey of people\u2019s opinions.",
              "For example, although people might report their brain health as \u201cexcellent,\u201d there was no objective measure of brain health such as an MRI scan, or even a test to measure their cognition.",
              "Lastly, even if the ratings were true, the findings are only correlations.",
              "They do not prove that, for example, it was the exposure to music as a child that led to one\u2019s improved ability to learn new things.",
              "It may be equally likely that those children brought up in more affluent households were both more likely to be exposed to music and to be given a good education that led to their being able to easily learn new things later in life.",
              "But let\u2019s assume that the results of the AARP survey are indeed true.",
              "How can music have such impressive brain effects?",
              "Although we don\u2019t know the answers for sure, developments in cognitive neuroscience over the last few years have allowed us to speculate on some possible mechanisms. Music has been shown to activate some of the broadest and most diverse networks of the brain.",
              "Of course, music activates the auditory cortex in the temporal lobes close to your ears, but that\u2019s just the beginning.",
              "The parts of the brain involved in emotion are not only activated during emotional music, they are also synchronized.",
              "Music also activates a variety of memory regions.",
              "And, interestingly, music activates the motor system.",
              "In fact, it has been theorized that it is the activation of the brain\u2019s motor system that allows us to pick out the beat of the music even before we start tapping our foot to it!",
              "Okay, so music activates just about all of the brain.",
              "Why is that so important?",
              "Well, have you ever heard the expression, \u201cIf you don\u2019t use it, you\u2019ll lose it\u201d?",

              "Brain pathways \u2014 and even whole networks \u2014 are strengthened when they are used and are weakened when they are not used.",
              "The reason is that the brain is efficient;",
              "it isn\u2019t going to bother keeping a brain pathway strong when it hasn\u2019t been used in many years.",
              "The brain will use the neurons in that pathway for something else.",
              "These types of changes should be intuitively obvious to you \u2014 that\u2019s why it is harder to speak that foreign language if you haven\u2019t used it in 20 years;",
              "many of the old pathways have degraded and the neurons are being used for other purposes.",
              "So just how does music promote well-being, enhance learning, stimulate cognitive function, improve quality of life, and even induce happiness?",
              "The answer is, because music can activate almost all brain regions and networks, it can help to keep a myriad of brain pathways and networks strong, including those networks that are involved in well-being, learning, cognitive function, quality of life, and happiness.",
              "In fact, there is only one other situation in which you can activate so many brain networks all at once, and that is when you participate in social activities.",
              "How do you incorporate music into your life?",
              "It\u2019s easy to do.",
              "Although the AARP survey found that those who actively listened to music showed the strongest brain benefits, even those who primarily listened to background music showed benefits, so you can turn that music on right now.",

              "Bipedalism, the use of fire, the development of effective working memory and our vocal language efficient communication have all emerged from these genetic\u2013environmental adaptations over several million years (Pasternak, 2007).",
              "Two features of our world which are universal and arguably have been a feature of an earlier evolutionary development are our ability to create and respond to music, and to dance to the beat of time.",
              "Somewhere along the evolutionary way, our ancestors, with very limited language but with considerable emotional expression, began to articulate and gesticulate feelings: denotation before connotation.",
              "But, as the philosopher Susanne Langer noted, \u2018The most highly developed type of such purely connotational semantic is music\u2019 (Langer, 1951, p.",
              "93).",
              "In other words, meaning in music came to us before meaning given by words.",
              "The mammalian middle ear developed from the jaw bones of earlier reptiles and carries sound at only specific frequencies.",
              "It is naturally attuned to the sound of the human voice, although has a range greater than that required for speech.",
              "Further, the frequency band which mothers use to sing to their babies, and so-called motherese or child-directed speech, with exaggerated intonation and rhythm, corresponds to that which composers have traditionally used in their melodies.",
              "In the same way that there is a limited sensitive period in which the infant can learn language and learn to respond to spoken language, there must be a similar phase of brain development for the incorporation of music.",
              "One of the differences between the developed brains of Homo sapiens and those of the great apes is the increase in area allocated to processing auditory information.",
              "Thus, in other primates the size of the visual cortex correlates well with brain size, but in Homo sapiens it is smaller.",
              "In contrast, increases in size elsewhere in the human brain have occurred, notably in the temporal lobes, especially the dorsal area that relates to the auditory reception of speech.",
              "The expansion of primary and association auditory cortices and their connections, associated with the increased size of the cerebellum and areas of prefrontal and premotor cortex linked through basal ganglia structures, heralded a shift to an aesthetics based on sound, and to abilities to entrain to external rhythmic inputs.",
              "The first musical instrument used by our ancestors was the voice.",
              "The ear is always open and, unlike vision and the eyes or the gaze, sound cannot readily be averted.",
              "From the rhythmic beating within and with the mother\u2019s body for the fetus and young infant, to the primitive drum-like beating of sticks on wood and hand clapping of our adolescent and adult proto-speaking ancestors, the growing infant is surrounded by and responds to rhythm.",
              "But, as Langer (1951, p.",
              "93) put it, \u2018being more variable than the drum, voices soon made patterns and the long endearing melodies of primitive song became a part of communal celebration\u2019.",
              "Some support for these ideas comes from the work of Mithen, who has argued that spoken language and music evolved from a proto-language, a musi-language which stemmed from primate calls and was used by the Neanderthals;",
              "it was emotional but without words as we know them (Mithen, 2005).",
              "The suggestion is that our language of today emerged via a proto-language, driven by gesture, framed by musicality and performed by the flexibility which accrued with expanded anatomical developments, not only of the brain, but also of the coordination of our facial, pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles.",
              "Around the same time (with a precision of many thousands of years), the bicameral brain, although remaining bipartite, with the two cooperating cerebral hemispheres coordinating life for the individual in cohesion with the surrounding environment, became differently balanced with regard to the functions of the two sides: pointing and proposition (left) as opposed to urging and yearning (right) (Trimble, 2012).",
              "A highly significant finding to emerge from the studies of the effects in the brain of listening to music is the emphasis on the importance of the right (non-dominant) hemisphere.",
              "Thus, lesions following cerebral damage lead to impairments of appreciation of pitch, timbre and rhythm (Stewart et al, 2006) and studies using brain imaging have shown that the right hemisphere is preferentially activated when listening to music in relation to the emotional experience, and that even imagining music activates areas on this side of the brain (Blood et al, 1999).",
              "This should not be taken to imply that there is a simple left\u2013right dichotomy of functions in the human brain.",
              "However, it is the case that traditional neurology has to a large extent ignored the talents of the non-dominant hemisphere, much in favour of the dominant (normally left) hemisphere.",
              "In part this stems from an overemphasis on the role of the latter in propositional language and a lack of interest in the emotional intonations of speech (prosody) that give so much meaning to expression.",
              "The link between music and emotion seems to have been accepted for all time.",
              "Plato considered that music played in different modes would arouse different emotions, and as a generality most of us would agree on the emotional significance of any particular piece of music, whether it be happy or sad;",
              "for example, major chords are perceived to be cheerful, minor ones sad.",
              "The tempo or movement in time is another component of this, slower music seeming less joyful than faster rhythms. This reminds us that even the word motion is a significant part of emotion, and that in the dance we are moving \u2013 as we are moved emotionally by music.",
              "Until recently, musical theorists had largely concerned themselves with the grammar and syntax of music rather than with the affective experiences that arise in response to music.",
              "Music, if it does anything, arouses feelings and associated physiological responses, and these can now be measured.",
              "For the ordinary listener, however, there may be no necessary relationship of the emotion to the form and content of the musical work, since \u2018the real stimulus is not the progressive unfolding of the musical structure but the subjective content of the listener\u2019s mind\u2019 (Langer, 1951, p.",
              "258).",
              "Such a phenomenological approach directly contradicts the empirical techniques of so much current neuroscience in this area, yet is of direct concern to psychiatry, and topics such as compositional creativity.",
              "If it is a language, music is a language of feeling.",
              "Musical rhythms are life rhythms, and music with tensions, resolutions, crescendos and diminuendos, major and minor keys, delays and silent interludes, with a temporal unfolding of events, does not present us with a logical language, but, to quote Langer again, it \u2018reveals the nature of feelings with a detail and truth that language cannot approach\u2019 (Langer, 1951, p.",
              "199, original emphasis).",
              "This idea seems difficult for a philosophical mind to follow, namely that there can be knowledge without words.",
              "Indeed, the problem of describing a \u2018language\u2019 of feeling permeates the whole area of philosophy and neuroscience research, and highlights the relative futility of trying to classify our emotions \u2013 \u2018Music is revealing, where words are obscuring\u2019 (Langer, 1951, p.",
              "206).",
              "There is an extensive literature attesting to some associations between creativity and psychopathology (Trimble, 2007).",
              "The links seem to vary with different kinds of high achievement, and mood disorders are over-represented.",
              "Although samples of creative people have a significant excess of cyclothymia and bipolarity, florid manic\u2013depressive illness is relatively uncommon.",
              "Biographies of famous musicians are of considerable interest in exploring brain\u2013behaviour associations.",
              "Attempts to transform descriptions of people from biographies into specific DSM diagnoses cannot achieve high levels of validity and reliability, since lack of autobiographical materials and reliable contemporary medical accounts makes any diagnostic formulation necessarily tentative.",
              "However, with regard to classical composers within the Western canon, it must be of considerable significance that there are so many who seem to have suffered from affective disorders, the incidence of mood disorders ranging between 35% and 40% (Mula & Trimble, 2009).",
              "It is possible that similar associations occur in non-Western composers, although studies have not been published.",
              "In contrast, none seems to have had schizophrenia.",
              "These results have importance in understanding the structure and function of the human brain, and suggest avenues for therapeutic investigation which will vary with diagnosis.",
              "Music provides and provokes a response, which is universal, ingrained into our evolutionary development, and leads to marked changes in emotions and movement.",
              "The anatomical associations noted above suggest that music must be viewed as one way to stimulate the brain.",
              "Music provides a non-invasive technique, which has attracted much interest but little empirical exploration to date.",
              "The therapeutic value of music can be in part explained by its cultural role in facilitating social learning and emotional well-being.",
              "However, a number of studies have shown that rhythmic entrainment of motor function can actively facilitate the recovery of movement in patients with stroke, Parkinson\u2019s disease, cerebral palsy and traumatic brain injury (Thaut, 2005).",
              "Studies of people with memory disorders, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, suggest that neuronal memory traces built through music are deeply ingrained and more resilient to neurodegenerative influences.",
              "Findings from individual randomised trials suggest that music therapy is accepted by people with depression and is associated with improvements in mood disorders (Maratos et al, 2008).",
              "Further, the potential applications of music therapy in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, albeit intuitive, have led to psychotherapeutic uses aimed at directly evoking emotions.",
              "Evidence suggests that music can decrease seizure frequency, stop refractory status epilepticus and decrease electroencephalographic spike frequency in children with epilepsy in awake and sleep states.",
              "We know that many people with epilepsy have electroencephalographic abnormalities and, in some people, these can be \u2018normalised\u2019 by music.",
              "In addition to the need for trials of musical interventions in epilepsy, we should also consider whether the results of sonification of an electroencephalogram, which directly reflects the time course of cerebral rhythms, may be used to entrain \u2018normal\u2019 brain rhythms in people with seizure disorders.",
              "Alteration of the electroencephalogram via biofeedback of different components of sonified electroencephalography, or modulation of the musical input to a stimulus that affects the emotional state of the patient and hence cerebral and limbic activity and cerebral rhythms, are therapeutic possibilities which are currently being investigated (Bodner et al, 2012).",
              "These data suggest that the effects and cost-effectiveness of music therapy in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders should be further explored.",
              "To date, most work has been done with Western-style compositions, and the well structured music of Mozart and Bach has been a popular basis for interventions.",
              "The following paper by Shantala Hegde notes the potential of other musical styles as therapy.",

              "The effect of music on cognitive functioning appears not to be \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d but to instead depend, in part, on your personality\u2014specifically, on your need for external stimulation.",

              "But other factors play a role as well.",
              "Gonzalez and Aiello took a fairly sophisticated approach to understanding the influence of music on intellectual performance, assessing not only listener personality but also manipulating the difficulty of the task and the complexity of the music.",
              "Whether students experience a perk or a penalty from music depends on the interplay of the personality of the learner, the mental task, and the music.",
              "In the study, participants first completed the Boredom Proneness Scale, which is a personality test used to determine need for external stimulation.",
              "They then engaged in an easy cognitive task (searching for the letter A in lists of words) and a more challenging one (remembering word pairs).",
              "To control for practice and fatigue effects, half of the subjects completed the easy task first, while the other half completed the challenging one first.",

              "Simple music included piano, strings and synthesizer, while complex music added drums and bass to the simple piece.",
              "The data suggest that your decision to turn music on (or off) while studying should depend on your personality.",
              "For those with a high need of external stimulation, listening to music while learning is not wise, especially if the task is hard and/or the music is complex.",
              "On the simple task of finding A\u2019s, such subjects\u2019 scores for the music condition were the same (for simple music) or significantly worse (for complex music) than those for the silent condition.",
              "On the complex task of learning word pairs, their performance was worse whenever music was played, regardless of whether it was simple or complex.",

              "On the simple task of findings A\u2019s, such participants\u2019 scores for the music condition were the same (for simple music) or dramatically better (for complex music) than those for the silent condition.",
              "On the complex task of learning word pairs, the participants showed a small but reliable benefit with both simple and complex music, relative to silence.",
              "The results suggest that there are substantial individual differences in the impact of music on cognitive function, and thus recommendations regarding its presence in the classroom, study hall or work environment may need to be personalized.",
              "Students who are easily bored and who seek out stimulation should be wary of adding music to the mix, especially complex music that may capture attention and consume critical cognitive resources that are needed for successful task completion.",
              "On the other hand, students with a low need for stimulation may benefit significantly from the presence of music, especially when completing simple, mundane tasks.",
              "Before students decide to slip in their earbuds, though, they should carefully consider both their musical selection and the nature of the task.",
              "All of the music used in the present study was instrumental, and lyrical music will likely be more complex.",
              "Complexity appears to increase arousal, and the Yerkes-Dodson law suggests that a moderate level of arousal produces optimal performance.",
              "When there is too little or too much arousal, performance drops.",
              "Thus, the benefits of music for those with a low need for external stimulation that were observed here could diminish or even disappear with the added complexity of lyrics.",

              "A recent survey on music and brain health conducted by AARP revealed some interesting findings about the impact of music on cognitive and emotional well-being: Those are pretty impressive results, to be sure.",
              "However, this 20-minute online survey has some limitations.",
              "For one, it included 3,185 US adults ages 18 and older;",
              "that is a small number if you are extrapolating to 328 million people across the country.",
              "For another, it is really a survey of people\u2019s opinions.",
              "For example, although people might report their brain health as \u201cexcellent,\u201d there was no objective measure of brain health such as an MRI scan, or even a test to measure their cognition.",
              "Lastly, even if the ratings were true, the findings are only correlations.",
              "They do not prove that, for example, it was the exposure to music as a child that led to one\u2019s improved ability to learn new things.",
              "It may be equally likely that those children brought up in more affluent households were both more likely to be exposed to music and to be given a good education that led to their being able to easily learn new things later in life.",
              "But let\u2019s assume that the results of the AARP survey are indeed true.",
              "How can music have such impressive brain effects?",
              "Although we don\u2019t know the answers for sure, developments in cognitive neuroscience over the last few years have allowed us to speculate on some possible mechanisms. Music has been shown to activate some of the broadest and most diverse networks of the brain.",
              "Of course, music activates the auditory cortex in the temporal lobes close to your ears, but that\u2019s just the beginning.",
              "The parts of the brain involved in emotion are not only activated during emotional music, they are also synchronized.",
              "Music also activates a variety of memory regions.",
              "And, interestingly, music activates the motor system.",
              "In fact, it has been theorized that it is the activation of the brain\u2019s motor system that allows us to pick out the beat of the music even before we start tapping our foot to it!",
              "Okay, so music activates just about all of the brain.",

              "many of the old pathways have degraded and the neurons are being used for other purposes.",
              "So just how does music promote well-being, enhance learning, stimulate cognitive function, improve quality of life, and even induce happiness?",
              "The answer is, because music can activate almost all brain regions and networks, it can help to keep a myriad of brain pathways and networks strong, including those networks that are involved in well-being, learning, cognitive function, quality of life, and happiness.",
              "In fact, there is only one other situation in which you can activate so many brain networks all at once, and that is when you participate in social activities.",

              "It\u2019s easy to do.",

              "In the three different sessions, separated by one week at least, the experts orally administrated to each participant a dopamine precursor (levodopa, which increases dopaminergic availability), a dopamine antagonist (risperidone;",

              "\u201cWhat we found sheds new light on the role of the human dopaminergic system in abstract rewards.",
              "Indeed, our findings challenge previous evidence conducted in animal models, where dopaminergic manipulations showed a clear role of dopamine in motivation and learning, but a controversial function in regulating hedonic responses in primary rewards such as food, mainly related to opioids release.",
              "\u201d \u201cThese results indicate that dopaminergic transmission in humans might play different or additive roles than the ones postulated in affective processing so far, particularly in abstract cognitive activities such as music listening,\u201d Ferreri explained.",
              "The researchers found that participants were willing to spend more money under the dopamine precursor levodopa than under the dopamine antagonist risperidone, indicating that they were more motivated to listen to the music again when dopaminergic transmission was enhanced than when it was blocked.",
              "\u201cIt is important to highlight that we were not looking for a magic pill able to increase the feelings of pleasure while listening to music.",

              "Drug intake did not alter their ability to recognize familiar melodies\u2014indicating that the drugs did not interfere with the recall and recognition of previous music experiences\u2014and it did not modulate perceived emotional valence or general arousal, which may be related to concrete acoustic attributes such as pitch, mode, tempo, or loudness (49, 50).",
              "Thus, one potential interpretation of our results, together with previous evidence in a task involving implicit reward through successful learning (37), is that dopamine-dependent cognitive processes such as learning and memory\u2014modulated up and down by levodopa and risperidone, respectively\u2014may substantially influence the pleasure generated by abstract activities.",

              "Further pharmacological interventions and PET studies targeting opioid and dopamine transmission are warranted to better understand the complex interplay between these two neurotransmitter systems in musical pleasure.",
              "Conversely, an alternative explanation of our results is that the feelings of pleasure evoked by abstract rewards, and music in particular, may differ from those evoked by primary rewards and thus driven by different psychological and neurobiological substrates (refs.",

              "Although these behaviors have been related to the motivational aspects of reward, one may wonder if these feelings may be interpreted as pleasurable.",
              "In this regard, dopamine releases driven by music might increase the attractiveness of the surrounding environment and the motivation to pursue and desire similar experiences leading to positive feelings that are attributed to \u201cpleasurable\u201d (12, 21).",
              "Thus, subjective experience of musical pleasure, similar to emotions (74), may arise from motivational signals and cognitive appraisal rather than through the engagement of the hedonic hotspots previously identified with primary rewards.",

              "Although genres accounted for more variance in the MUSIC model than did attributes, it should be noted that there were more genres (26) than attributes (14) in the regression analyses, and that with more predictors in a multiple regression model, the higher should be the resulting multiple correlation.",

              "Although the pieces of music used in Study 1 were completely different from those used in Studies 2 and 3, the findings from all three studies revealed five clear and interpretable music-preference dimensions: a Mellow factor comprising smooth and relaxing musical styles;",

              "Each of these factors resemble those reported previously, and the high degree of convergence across the present studies and previous research suggests that music preferences, whether for genres of musical pieces, are defined by five latent factors.",

              "The results from this study also suggest that preferences for the MUSIC factors are affected by both the social and auditory characteristics of the music.",
              "Specifically, musical attributes accounted for significant proportions of variance in preferences for the Mellow, Urban, Sophisticated, Intense, and Campestral music factors, over and above music genres.",

              "However, if preferences are the result of liking certain configurations of musical attributes, then we should expect the MUSIC model to emerge in a heterogeneous selection of musical pieces from the same genre.",

              "Such an equation would include a number of parameters, like age of the listener, gender, education, and income, as well as the music preferences of the listener, which could include a score on each of the five MUSIC factors.",
              "There might be other parameters too, such as the time of day (presumably people like different music when the wake up versus when going to sleep), and the mood of the listener.",
              "Taken together with such potential other parameters, the MUSIC model might prove to be a part of improving music recommendation software: the MUSIC factors may capture the latent structure of individual music preferences better than traditional genre labels.",
              "Thus, future research could evaluate the efficacy of the MUSIC model in predicting which pieces of music individuals like and which ones they dislike.",
              "It seems reasonable to suppose that music preferences are shaped by psychological dispositions, social interactions as well as exposure to popular media and cultural trends.",
              "Thus, preferences for a particular style of music may vary as a function of personality traits, social class, ethnicity, country of residence, and cohort, as well as the culture-specific associations with that style of music.",
              "However, the reliance on genre-based preference measures makes it difficult to examine music preferences among people from different generations and cultures because their knowledge and familiarity with the genres will vary significantly.",

              "This finding should help pave the way for future research by enabling researchers to develop music-preference measures that are not language based and can therefore be administered to individuals of different age groups, social classes, and cultures.",
              "Audio-based music preference measures that include musical excerpts from a wide array of genres, time periods, and cultures will help researchers further explore the structure of music-preferences and ascertain whether the MUSIC model is universal.",
              "In the meantime, the MUSIC model provides a useful framework for conceptualizing and measuring music preferences across the life course.",
              "Future research is well positioned to examine some very important issues, including whether the MUSIC factors emerge in different age groups, whether individual differences in preferences for the MUSIC factors change throughout life, and whether social and psychological variables differentially affect music preferences over time.",
              "The social connotations of particular musical styles are shaped by culture and society, and those connotations change over time.",
              "For example, jazz music now means something very different than it did 100 years ago;",
              "whereas jazz is currently thought of as sophisticated and creative, earlier generations considered it uncivilized and lewd.",
              "This raises questions about the stability of the MUSIC model across generations.",
              "Are the factors cohort- and culture- specific, or do they transcend space and time?",
              "It is tempting to suppose that the structure of music preferences may be more stable and enduring than the genres that are included in any period of time because styles of music come and go, their cultural relevance and popularity fluctuate, and consequently, their social connotations change.",
              "Yet, it is conceivable that there has been, and will continue to be, a Sophisticated music-preference factor that includes complex and cerebral music, but the genres that comprise that factor change over time.",
              "Perhaps there will also continue to be factors of music preferences that are Mellow, Urban, Intense, and Campestral, but the genres that comprise those factors may change as their social connotations change.",
              "If so, then it is possible that the links between the MUSIC factors and personality may be stable across generations.",
              "Much of the research concerned with music preferences has focused on questions pertaining to its structure and external correlates;",
              "very few studies have actually examined the contexts in which people listen to music and the particular music they listen to.",
              "As a result, most of the research in this area conceptualizes preferences as trait-like constructs and assume that preferences reflect the types of music people listen to most of the time.",
              "However, as Sloboda and O\u2019Neill (2001) noted, music is always heard in context, so it is necessary to consider contextual forces and state-preferences in addition to trait-preferences.",
              "Indeed, trait variables necessarily interact with specific situations and a type of fundamental attribution error (Ross, 1977) may be at work in judgments about music preferences.",
              "Weddings, funerals, sporting events or relaxation, for example, constrain musical choices, and individual preferences operate within those constraints.",
              "One may prefer a particular piece or style of music (e.",
              "g., Chopin\u2019s Polonaises) in a particular context (at home reading leisurely) but never want to hear it in another context (during a Pilates workout).",
              "A complete theory of musical preferences must necessarily focus on the functions of music, and reflect situational constraints in interaction with personality traits.",
              "A growing body of research has begun to identify some of the social psychological processes and roles of the environment that link people to their music preferences.",
              "For instance, in a study in which different styles of new-age music were played (low, moderate, and highly complex) in a dining area, participants reported preferring low and moderately complex music (North & Hargreaves, 1996a).",
              "Further, when individuals were in unpleasant arousal-provoking situations (e.",
              "g., driving in busy traffic), they preferred relaxing music, whereas in pleasant arousal-provoking situations (e.",
              "g., exercising), they preferred stimulating music (North & Hargreaves, 1996b;",
              "1997).",
              "Thus, it would appear as though music preferences are, to some degree, moderated by situational goals.",
              "Further exploration of music preferences in context should consider the emotional state of the individual prior to listening to music.",
              "Numerous studies have shown that music can elicit certain emotional reactions in listeners (see Scherer & Zentner, 2001) but there is considerably less information about how mood might influence our music selections or how we respond to the music that we hear.",
              "For instance, do people in a sad mood prefer listening to happy music in order to change their mood?",
              "Or do they prefer listening to mood-consistent music?",
              "Or do some kinds of individuals prefer one of those and others prefer the other?",
              "One potentially fruitful direction would be to expand research on music attributes to focus more on the affective aspects of music preferences.",
              "It is obvious that in any one genre there are a variety of different moods expressed in the music;",
              "even one album could run the gamut of emotions.",
              "Thus, future research could further examine individual differences in preferences for musical attributes and whether certain attributes are preferred more in some situations over others.",
              "It goes without saying that music is important to people.",
              "Curiously, however, we know very little about why it is so important.",
              "To shed some light on this issue, we need a sturdy framework for conceptualizing and measuring musical preferences.",
              "The present research provides a foundation on which to develop such a framework.",

              "Citation numbers are available from Dimensions Carnegie Mellon University, United States University of Malta, Malta Carnegie Mellon University, United States Music preferences are strongly shaped by the cultural and socio-economic background of the listener, which is reflected, to a considerable extent, in country-specific music listening profiles.",
              "Previous work has already identified several country-specific differences in the popularity distribution of music artists listened to.",
              "In particular, what constitutes the \u201cmusic mainstream\u201d strongly varies between countries.",
              "To complement and extend these results, the article at hand delivers the following major contributions: First, using state-of-the-art unsupervized learning techniques, we identify and thoroughly investigate (1) country profiles of music preferences on the fine-grained level of music tracks (in contrast to earlier work that relied on music preferences on the artist level) and (2) country archetypes that subsume countries sharing similar patterns of listening preferences.",
              "Second, we formulate four user models that leverage the user\u2019s country information on music preferences.",
              "Among others, we propose a user modeling approach to describe a music listener as a vector of similarities over the identified country clusters or archetypes.",
              "Third, we propose a context-aware music recommendation system that leverages implicit user feedback, where context is defined via the four user models.",
              "More precisely, it is a multi-layer generative model based on a variational autoencoder, in which contextual features can influence recommendations through a gating mechanism.",
              "Fourth, we thoroughly evaluate the proposed recommendation system and user models on a real-world corpus of more than one billion listening records of users around the world (out of which we use 369 million in our experiments) and show its merits vis-a\u0300-vis state-of-the-art algorithms that do not exploit this type of context information.",
              "Recommendation systems (or recommender systems) have become an important means to help users find and discover various types of content and goods, including movies, videos, books, and food (Ricci et al.",

              "As such, they represent substantial business value.",

              "While MRS operate in a multi-stakeholder environment including platform providers, artists, record companies, and music consumers/listeners (Bauer and Zangerle, 2019), it is most commonly the music consumers/listeners, who are considered the users of an MRS.",
              "In the paper at hand, we also take this perspective.",
              "Traditionally, content-based filtering and collaborative filtering (CF)\u2014or hybrid combinations thereof\u2014have been the most common algorithms to create recommender systems (Ricci et al.",
              ", 2015).",
              "The former assumes that users will like items similar to the ones they liked in the past, and therefore selects items to recommend according to some notion or metric of similarity in terms of item content (e.",
              "g., music style, timbre, or rhythm) between the user\u2019s liked items and unseen items from the catalog.",
              "In contrast, CF assumes that a user will prefer items that are liked by other users with similar preferences.",
              "In this case, items to recommend are, for instance, found by comparing the target user\u2019s consumption or rating profile to that of the other users, identifying the most similar other users, and recommending what they liked (user-based CF).",
              "Alternatively, users and items can be directly matched via similarities computed in a joint low-dimensional representation of users and items (i.",
              "e., model-based CF).",
              "Enhancing the classical approaches CF and content-based filtering, in recent years, researchers started to leverage additional information\u2014beyond users, items, and their interactions\u2014to improve recommendations.",
              "Recommender systems that consider user characteristics or information describing a situation are typically referred to as context-aware recommendation systems (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin, 2015).",
              "Next to considering time and location as contextual side information, taking information derived from the user\u2019s country into account has been demonstrated to improve recommendation quality;",
              "for instance, cultural and socio-economic characteristics of the user\u2019s country (Zangerle et al.",
              ", 2018), or the user taste\u2019s proximity to their country-specific music mainstream (\u201cmainstreaminess\u201d) (Bauer and Schedl, 2019).",
              "Against this background, we approach the task of context-aware music recommendation based on country information;",
              "in contrast to most previous works, we consider user country in our approach without using any external information about the country, such as cultural, economic, or societal information.",
              "The reason is that respective data sources about countries (e.",
              "g., Hofstede\u2019s cultural dimensions,1 the Quality of Government measures,2 or the World Happiness Report3) provide information on the country level, which may not necessarily reflect the circumstances of individual users and, thus, can introduce problems in the recommendation process.",
              "For instance, cultural values or income may be very unequally distributed among a country\u2019s population.",
              "To avoid this, instead of using external information derived from the user\u2019s country, we leverage purely the self-reported country information of the users as available in the system, and investigate how behavioral data about music listening can be used to (1) identify archetypal country clusters based on track listening preferences, (2) how users can be modeled using the results of (1), and (3) how the resulting user models can be integrated into a state-of-the-art deep learning-based music recommendation algorithm.",
              "As in many other domains, nowadays, deep neural network architectures dominate research in music recommendation systems, due to their ability to automatically learn features from low-level audio signals and their superior performance (Schedl, 2019).",
              "This article is no exception.",
              "We propose a multi-layer generative model in which contextual features can influence recommendations through a gating mechanism.",
              "In this context, we formulate the following research questions: RQ1: To what extent can we identify and interpret groups of countries that constitute music preference archetypes, from behavioral traces of users\u2019 music listening records?",
              "RQ2: Which are effective ways to model the users\u2019 geographic background as a contextual factor for music recommendation?",
              "RQ3: How can we extend a state-of-the-art recommendation algorithm, based on variational autoencoders, to include user context information, in particular, the geo-aware user models developed to answer RQ2?",
              "In the remainder of this article, we first explain the conceptual foundation of our work and discuss it in the context of related research (Section 2).",
              "Subsequently, we detail the methods we adopt to investigate the research questions;",
              "in particular, we specify the approaches used for data preparation, clustering, user modeling, and track recommendation (Section 3).",
