              "A day later, an international group of scientists announced that they had revived microbes which had lain dormant in seabed mud for 100 million years.",
              "The physiological limits of life on Earth can be pushed to fairly spectacular limits, it would seem \u2013 although it should be stressed that each of these feats reveal different aspects of the ageing process.",
              "The Methuselah tree\u2019s longevity reveals the remarkable endurance of a single entity.",
              "The kelp story reflects the great age of a population, but not of its individual plants, while the revival of ancient seabed microbes shows how suspended animation can be extraordinarily long-lasting.",
              "Nevertheless, there is a common theme to these recently announced research results, as an expert on ageing, Prof Tom Kirkwood of Newcastle University, points out: \u201cThese stories all speak to the endurance of life and at a time when we have become fixated with ideas about our own mortality.",
              "\u201d The diversity of lifespans on Earth is certainly extraordinary.",
              "Mayflies live for little more than 24 hours in their adult form, while small, fresh-water organisms called hydra \u2013 which can regenerate damaged tissue \u2013 are considered to be effectively immortal.",
              "The fruit fly, from egg through larva and pupa to adult, lives for a mere 14 days, while the world\u2019s oldest known terrestrial animal, 188-year-old Jonathan the giant tortoise, is still contentedly wandering around his home in the grounds of the governor\u2019s residence on the island of Saint Helena.",
              "This startling variation in lifespans raises a fundamental question, however: why do some animals and plants live to a ripe old age while other, apparently very similar, lifeforms spend dramatically short times on Earth?",
              "One of the reasons is simple: animals that are prey tend to have shorter lives compared with predators, even though they have similar bodyweights.",
              "Everything is out to get them, in other words.",
              "This point is illustrated intriguingly by the examples of the mouse and the bat.",
              "Both are small mammals, but they have very different life expectancies.",
              "A mouse is lucky to survive a year in the wild and will die within three even if it is kept as a pampered pet.",
              "By contrast, most bats live until they are around 30, with some making it to 50 or more.",
              "So why such a startling difference?",
              "Part of the answer is straightforward, says David Clancy of Lancaster University.",
              "\u201cOne has wings and the other does not.",
              "That means the mouse is prey for a host of different land predators, from cats to humans.",
              "By contrast, the bat has no real enemies because it can always fly from danger.",
              "\u201d However, it is not the avoidance of predators on its own that gives the bat its longevity, adds Clancy.",
              "Even in the absence of predators, a mouse\u2019s lifespan will probably still be only a tenth that of a bat.",
              "There is a basic difference in the two creatures\u2019 internal programming \u2013 involving processes such as the repair of damaged DNA \u2013 that underpins this divergence in age.",
              "\u201cA mouse\u2019s internal processes don\u2019t invest very much in cell maintenance,\u201d says Kirkwood.",
              "\u201cThere is no point, because the mouse is not going to live for very long.",
              "Why bother to keep cells in good repair if you are doomed to die in a year?",
              "\u201d Cell maintenance is a costly business that uses up internal energy resources, and an animal will only provide just enough to keep it in good shape for as long as it expects to survive in the wild.",
              "\u201cInstead, the mouse \u2018bets\u2019 its survival strategy \u2013 unconsciously, of course \u2013 on having large numbers of babies as quickly as possible,\u201d adds Kirkwood.",
              "But what would happen if the mouse evolved wings, he asks.",
              "It could then fly about and avoid predators, just like a bat.",
              "\u201cHowever its internal processing will still be providing poor maintenance to cells.",
              "It will die fairly quickly and so waste the benefit of evolving and growing those wings.",
              "\u201d Evolutionary change would then begin, according to Kirkwood\u2019s hypothesis, which is known as the disposable soma theory.",
              "Mice with wings will start to live longer firstly by avoiding predators, while those flying mice with slightly better cell repair systems than others will live even longer and so begin a gradual improvement in cell maintenance, which over generations would produce a flying mouse \u2013 a bat, in other words \u2013 that lives for much longer.",
              "And that is what we see in nature, says Kirkwood.",
              "A similar effect is seen in humans and chimps.",
              "The two species evolved from a common ancestor about seven million years ago.",
              "\u201cOver that time, we have evolved bigger and bigger brains that have made it easier for us to develop strategies for surviving for longer periods, and so our cell maintenance services have had to improve,\u201d says Kirkwood.",
              "As a result, he adds, our lifespans are now twice those of chimpanzees.",
              "\u201cThe crucial point to realise is that organisms didn\u2019t evolve to die,\u201d added Clancy.",
              "\u201cThey evolved to survive.",
              "The first organisms that appeared on Earth may only have had very short existences, but as new niches were found, expectations of living longer have slowly risen.",

              "However, others regard these patterns as being due to natural material deposition or some other abiogenic mechanism.",
              "Scientists have argued for a biological origin of stromatolites due to the presence of organic globule clusters within the thin layers of the stromatolites, of aragonite nanocrystals (both features of current stromatolites),[14] and of other microstructures in older stromatolites that parallel those in younger stromatolites that show strong indications of biological origin.",

              "this theory implies that sufficiently complex organisms were common over 1 billion years ago.",
              "[25][26][27] Another hypothesis is that protozoans such as foraminifera were responsible for the decline, favoring formation of thrombolites over stromatolites through microscopic bioturbation.",

              "[30][11] While prokaryotic cyanobacteria reproduce asexually through cell division, they were instrumental in priming the environment for the evolutionary development of more complex eukaryotic organisms.[23] They are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primeval earth's atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis (see Great Oxygenation Event).",
