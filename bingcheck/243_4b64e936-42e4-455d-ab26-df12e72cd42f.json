              "Combining elements of the Spanish guitar-playing tradition with the rhythmic complexity and call-and-response vocal tradition of African musical sources, the son originated in rural eastern Cuba and spread to Havana in the first decades of the 20th century.",
              "Highly syncopated, it employs an \u201canticipated\u201d rhythm structure wherein the bass line precedes the downbeat by a half-beat, creating a distinctive pulse.",
              "Pioneered by bandleader Arsenio Rodri\u0301guez, the son became the framework on which was hung a wide variety of dance-oriented Afro-Cuban musical styles, from the bolero to the conga and from the rumba to the mambo.",
              "Afro-Cuban music spread throughout Latin America, notably to Mexico.",
              "However, New York City became the forge for its transformation into salsa, beginning in the 1940s with the contributions of the orchestra led by Cuban e\u0301migre\u0301 Machito (Frank Grillo), which blended Afro-Cuban styles with jazz and big band approaches.",
              "Another Cuban e\u0301migre\u0301, Celia Cruz, became the reigning diva of Afro-Cuban dance music in the 1960s, as it evolved into salsa with smaller ensembles comprising rhythm and horn sections and through huge contributions by a number of musicians of Puerto Rican heritage, most notably bandleaders Tito Rodri\u0301guez, Tito Puente (a virtuoso timbale player and vibraphonist), and Eddie Palmieri (a pianist who brought progressive jazz influences into the mix).",

              "Although its international popularity crested in the 1970s, salsa retained an audience into the 21st century."

              "Traditionally performed by poor workers of African descent in streets and solares (courtyards), rumba remains one of Cuba's most characteristic forms of music and dance.",

              "Cajones (wooden boxes) were used as drums until the early 20th century, when they were replaced by tumbadoras (conga drums).",
              "During the genre's recorded history, which began in the 1940s, there have been numerous successful rumba bands such as Los Papines, Los Mun\u0303equitos de Matanzas, Clave y Guaguanco\u0301, AfroCuba de Matanzas and Yoruba Andabo.",

              "These songs were actually in the form of urban guarachas (not proper rumbas), which had a binary meter in contrast to the ternary meter of traditional rural genres such as tonada and zapateo.",
              "[10][11] Similarly, in Cuban bufo theatre at the beginning of the 20th century, the guarachas that were sung at the end of the show were referred to as rumba final despite not sharing any musical similarities with actual rumba.",
              "[12][13] Rumba instrumentation has varied historically depending on the style and the availability of the instruments.",
              "The core instruments of any rumba ensemble are the claves, two hard wooden sticks that are struck against each other, and the conga drums: quinto (lead drum, highest-pitched), tres dos (middle-pitched), and tumba or salidor (lowest-pitched).",
              "Other common instruments include the cata\u0301 or guagua, a wooden cylinder;",

              "[2][14][15][16] During the 1940s, the genre experienced a mutual influence with son cubano, especially by Ignacio Pin\u0303eiro's Septeto Nacional and Arsenio Rodri\u0301guez's conjunto, which led to the incorporation of instruments such as the tres, the double bass, the trumpet and the piano, and the removal of idiophone instruments.",
              "[17] At the same time, Cuban big bands, in collaboration with musical artists such as Chano Pozo, began to include authentic rumbas among their dance pieces.",
              "The group AfroCuba de Matanzas, founded in 1957, added bata\u0301 drums to the traditional rumba ensemble in their style, known as bata\u0301-rumba.",
              "More recently, a cappella (vocals-only, without instruments) rumba has been performed by the Cuban ensemble Vocal Sampling, as heard in their song \"Conga Yambumba\".",
              "Although rumba is played predominantly in binary meter (duple pulse: 24, 44), triple meter (triple pulse: 98, 34) is also present.",
              "In most rumba styles, such as yambu\u0301 and guaguanco\u0301, duple pulse is primary and triple-pulse is secondary.",
              "[18] In contrast, in the rural style columbia, triple pulse is the primary structure and duple pulse is secondary.",
              "This can be explained due to the \"binarization\" of African-based ternary rhythms.[19] Both the claves and the quinto (lead drum) are responsible for establishing the rhythm.",
              "Subsequently, the other instruments play their parts supporting the lead drum.",
              "Rhythmically, rumba is based on the five-stroke guide pattern called clave and the inherent structure it conveys.",
              "[20] Yambu\u0301 and guaguanco\u0301 songs often begin with the soloist singing a melody with meaningless syllables, rather than with word-based lyrics.",
              "This introductory part is called the diana.",
              "According to Larry Crook, the diana is important because it \"also contains the first choral refrain\".",
              "The lead singer provides a melodic phrase or musical motive/theme for the choral sections, or they may present new but related material.",
              "Parallel harmonies are usually built above or below a melodic line, with \"thirds, sixths, and octaves most common.\"",
              "[21] Therefore, the singer who is singing the diana initiates the beginning of the rumba experience for the audience.",
              "The singer then improvises lyrics stating the reason for holding and performing the present rumba.",
              "This kind of improvisation is called decimar, since it is done in de\u0301cimas, ten-line stanzas.",
              "Alternatively, the singer might sing an established song.",

              "Rumba songs consist of two main sections.",
              "The first, the canto, features the lead vocalist, performing an extended text of verses that are sometimes partially improvised.",
              "The lead singer usually plays claves.",
              "[22] The first section may last a few minutes, until the lead vocalist signals for the other singers to repeat the short refrain of the chorus, in call and response.",
              "This second section of the song is sometimes referred to as the montuno.",
              "It should be mentioned at the outset that the history of rumba is filled with so many unknowns, contradictions, conjectures and myths which have, over time been taken as fact, that any definitive history of the genre is probably impossible to reconstruct.",

              "Cultural retention among the Bantu, Yoruba, Fon (Arara\u0301), and Efik (Abakua\u0301) had the most significant impact in western Cuba, where rumba was born.",
              "The consistent interaction of Africans and Europeans on the island brought about what today is known as Afro-Cuban culture.",
              "This is a process known as transculturation, an idea that Cuban scholar Fernando Ortiz brought to the forefront in cultural studies like Cuban Counterpoint: Tobacco and Sugar.",
              "Cuban transculturation melds Spanish culture with African cultures, as with the seamless merging found in rumba.",

              "[26] The earliest progenitors of the urban styles of rumba (yambu\u0301 and guaguanco\u0301) might have developed during the early 19th century in slave barracks (barracones) long before the use of the term rumba as a genre became established.",
              "[25] Such proto-rumba styles were probably instrumented with household items such as boxes and drawers instead of the congas, and frying pans, spoons and sticks instead of guaguas, palitos and claves.",

              "Urban rumba styles are rooted in the so-called coros de clave and coros de guaguanco\u0301, street choirs that derived from the Spanish orfeones.",
              "In addition, the widespread yuka dance and music of Congolese origin became integrated into such choirs, lending its percussion instruments and dance moves.",
              "In addition, the secret Abakua\u0301 traditions rooted in the Calabar region of West Africa that prevailed in both Havana and Matanzas also influenced the development of rumba as a syncretic genre.",

              "From the coros the clave evolved the coros de guaguanco\u0301, which comprised mostly men, had a 24 time, and incorporated drums.[28] Famous coros de guaguanco\u0301 include El Timbre de Oro, Los Roncos (both featuring Ignacio Pin\u0303eiro, the latter as director), and Paso Franco.",
              "[29] These ensembles gave rise to the first authentic rumba groups, and with them several types of rumba emerged, including the now popular guaguanco\u0301 and yambu\u0301.",
              "However, others have been lost to time or are extremely rare today, such as the tahona,[30] papalote,[27] tonada,[31] and the jiribilla and reseda\u0301.",

              "[32] Even after slavery was abolished in Cuba, there still remained social and racial inequality, which Afro-Cubans dealt with by using rumba's music and dancing as an outlet of frustration.",
              "Because Afro-Cubans had fewer economic opportunities and the majority lived in poverty, the style of dance and music did not gain national popularity and recognition until the 1950s, and especially after the effects of the 1959 Cuban Revolution, which institutionalized it.",

              "Cajones (wooden boxes) were used as drums until the early 20th century when they were replaced by tumbadoras (conga drums).",
              "During the genre\u2019s recorded history, which began in the 1940s, there have been numerous successful rumba bands such as Los Papines, Los Mun\u0303equitos de Matanzas, Clave y Guaguanco\u0301, AfroCuba de Matanzas and Yoruba Andabo.",
              "Since its early days, the genre\u2019s popularity has been largely confined to Cuba, although its legacy has reached well beyond the island.",
              "In the United States, it gave its name to the so-called \u201cballroom rumba\u201d or rhumba, and in Africa soukous is commonly referred to as \u201cCongolese rumba\u201d (despite being actually based on son Cubano).",
              "Its influence in Spain is testified by rumba Flamenca and derivatives such as Catalan rumba.",
              "STYLES OF THE RUMBA.",
              "Traditionally rumba has been classified into three main subgenres: yambu\u0301, guaguanco\u0301, and Columbia.",
              "Both yambu\u0301 and guaguanco\u0301 originated in the solares, large houses in the poorest districts of Havana, and Matanzas mostly inhabited by the descendants of enslaved Africans.",
              "Both styles are thus predominantly urban, danced by men and women alike, and exhibit a historical \u201cbinarization\u201d of their meter, as described by Cuban musicologist Rolando Antonio Pe\u0301rez Ferna\u0301ndez.",
              "In contrast, Columbia has a primarily rural origin, also in the central regions of Cuba, being almost exclusively danced by men, and remaining much more grounded in West African (specifically Abakua\u0301 traditions), which is exemplified by its triple meter.",
              "During the 20th century, these styles have evolved, and other subgenres have appeared such as guarapachangueo and bata\u0301-rumba.",
              "In all rumba styles, there is a gradual heightening of tension and dynamics, not simply between dancers but also between dancers and musicians and dancers and spectator/participants.",
              "\u201d YAMBU\u0301.",
              "Yambu\u0301 is considered the oldest style of rumba, originating in colonial times.",
              "Hence, it is often called \u201cyambu\u0301 de tiempo Espan\u0303a\u201d (yambu\u0301 of Spanish times).",
              "It has the slowest tempo of all rumba styles and its dance incorporates movements feigning frailty.",
              "It can be danced alone (usually by women) or by men and women together.",
              "Although male dancers may flirt with female dancers during the dance, they do not use the vacunao of guaguanco\u0301.",
              "In Matanzas, the basic quinto part for yambu\u0301 and guaguanco\u0301 alternates the tone-slap melody.",
              "The following example shows the sparsest form of the basic Matanzas-style quinto for yambu\u0301 and guaguanco\u0301.",
              "The first measure is tone-slap-tone, and the second measure is the opposite: slap-tone-slap.",
              "Regular noteheads indicate open tones and triangle note-heads indicate slaps.",

              "Guaguanco\u0301 is the most popular and influential rumba style.",
              "It is similar to yambu\u0301 in most aspects, having derived from it,[59] but it has a faster tempo.",
              "The term \u201cguaguanco\u0301\u201d originally referred to a narrative song style (coros de guaguanco\u0301) which emerged from the coros de clave of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.",
              "Rogelio Marti\u0301nez Fure\u0301 states: \u201c[The] old folks contend that strictly speaking, the guaguanco\u0301 is the narrative.",

              "[59] Guaguanco\u0301 is a couple dance of sexual competition between the male and female.",
              "The male periodically attempts to \u201ccatch\u201d his partner with a single thrust of his pelvis.",
              "This erotic movement is called the vacunao (\u2018vaccination\u2019 or more specifically \u2018injection\u2019), a gesture derived from yuka and makuta, symbolizing sexual penetration.",
              "The vacunao can also be expressed with a sudden gesture made by the hand or foot.",
              "The quinto often accents the vacunao, usually as the resolution to a phrase spanning more than one cycle of clave.",
              "Holding onto the ends of her skirt while seductively moving her upper and lower body in contrary motion, the female \u201copens\u201d and \u201ccloses\u201d her skirt in rhythmic cadence with the music.",
              "The male attempts to distract the female with fancy (often counter-metric) steps, accented by the quinto, until he is in position to \u201cinject\u201d her.",
              "The female reacts by quickly turning away, bringing the ends of her skirts together, or covering her groin area with her hand (botao), symbolically blocking the \u201cinjection.",
              "\u201d Most of the time the male dancer does not succeed in \u201ccatching\u201d his partner.",
              "The dance is performed with good-natured humor.",
              "Vernon Boggs states that the woman\u2019s \u201cdancing expertise resides in her ability to entice the male while skillfully avoiding being touched by his vacunao.",
              "\u201d COLUMBIA.",
              "Columbia is a fast and energetic rumba, often accompanied the standard bell pattern struck on a guataca (\u2018hoe blade\u2019) or a metal bell.",
              "Columbia originated in the hamlets, plantations, and docks where men of African descent worked together.",
              "Unlike other rumba styles, Columbia is traditionally meant to be a solo male dance.",
              "According to Cuban rumba master and historian Gregorio \u201cEl Goyo\u201d Herna\u0301ndez, Columbia originated from the drum patterns and chants of religious Cuban Abakua\u0301 traditions.",
              "The drum patterns of the lowest conga drum are essentially the same in both Columbia and Abakua\u0301.",
              "The rhythmic phrasing of the Abakua\u0301 lead drum bonko\u0301 enchemiya\u0301 is similar, and in some instances, identical to Columbia quinto phrases.",
              "Abakua\u0301 bonko\u0301 phrase which is also played by the Quinto in Columbia.",
              "In Matanzas, the melody of the basic Columbia Quinto part alternates with every clave.",
              "As seen in the example below, the first measure is tone-slap-tone, while the second measure is the inverse: slap-tone-slap.",
              "The guagua (ca\u0301scara or palito) rhythm of Columbia, beaten either with two sticks on a guagua (hollowed piece of bamboo) or on the rim of the congas, is the same as the pattern used in abakua\u0301 music, played by two small plaited rattles (erikundi) filled with beans or similar objects.",
              "One hand plays the triple-pulse rumba clave pattern, while the other plays the four main beats.",
              "Men may also compete with other men to display their agility, strength, confidence and even sense of humor.",
              "Some of these aforementioned aspects of rumba Columbia are derived from a colonial Cuban martial art/dance called juego de mani\u0301 which shares similarities to Brazilian capoeira.",
              "Columbia incorporates many movements derived from Abakua\u0301 and yuka dances, as well as Spanish flamenco, and contemporary expressions of the dance often incorporate breakdancing and hip hop moves.",

              "Rumba is a secular genre of Cuban music involving dance, percussion, and song.",
              "It originated in the northern regions of Cuba, mainly in urban Havana and Matanzas, during the late 19th century.",
              "It is based on African music and dance traditions, namely Abakua\u0301 and yuka, as well as the Spanish-based coros de clave.",
              "According to Argeliers Leo\u0301n, rumba is one of the major \"genre complexes\" of Cuban music,[1] and the term rumba complex is now commonly used by musicologists.",
              "[2][3] This complex encompasses the three traditional forms of rumba (yambu\u0301, guaguanco\u0301 and columbia), as well as their contemporary derivatives and other minor styles.",
              "Traditionally performed by poor workers of African descent in streets and solares (courtyards), rumba remains one of Cuba's most characteristic forms of music and dance.",
              "Vocal improvisation, elaborate dancing and polyrhythmic drumming are the key components of all rumba styles.",
              "Cajones (wooden boxes) were used as drums until the early 20th century, when they were replaced by tumbadoras (conga drums).",
              "During the genre's recorded history, which began in the 1940s, there have been numerous successful rumba bands such as Los Papines, Los Mun\u0303equitos de Matanzas, Clave y Guaguanco\u0301, AfroCuba de Matanzas and Yoruba Andabo.",
              "Since its early days, the genre's popularity has been largely confined to Cuba, although its legacy has reached well beyond the island.",
              "In the United States, it gave its name to the so-called \"ballroom rumba\", or rhumba, and in Africa, soukous is commonly referred to as \"Congolese rumba\" (despite being actually based on son cubano).",
              "Its influence in Spain is testified by rumba flamenca and derivatives such as Catalan rumba.",
              "The origin of the term rumba remains unknown and no etymological information is provided by the Diccionario de la lengua espan\u0303ola.",
              "[4] According to Joan Corominas, the word derives from \"rumbo\", meaning \"uproar\" (and previously \"pomp\") and also \"the course of a ship\", which itself may derive from the word \"rombo\" (\"rhombus\"), a symbol used in compasses.",
              "[5] In the 1978 documentary La rumba, directed by O\u0301scar Valde\u0301s, it is stated that the term rumba originated in Spain to denote \"all that is held as frivolous\", deriving from the term \"mujeres de rumbo\".",
              "[6] Alternatively, in Cuba the term might have originated from a West African or Bantu language, due to its similarity to other Afro-Caribbean words such as tumba, macumba, mambo and tambo\u0301.",
              "[2] During the 19th century in Cuba, specifically in urban Havana and Matanzas, people of African descent originally used the word rumba as a synonym for party.",
              "According to Olavo Ale\u0301n, in these areas \"[over time] rumba ceased to be simply another word for party and took on the meaning both of a defined Cuban musical genre and also of a very specific form of dance.\"",
              "[7] The terms rumbo\u0301n and rumbantela (the latter of Galician or Portuguese origin[5]) are frequently used to denote rumba performances in the streets.",
              "[8][9] Many other terms have been used in Cuba to refer to parties, such as changu\u0308i\u0301 (in Oriente), guateque (in rural regions), tumba (by Afro-Cubans), bembe\u0301 (associated with Santeri\u0301a), macumba and mambo.",
              "Due to its broad etymology, the term rumba historically retained a certain degree of polysemy.",
              "By the end of the 19th century, Cuban peasants (guajiros) began to perform rumbitas during their parties (guateques, changu\u0308i\u0301s, parrandas and fiestas patronales).",
              "These songs were actually in the form of urban guarachas (not proper rumbas), which had a binary meter in contrast to the ternary meter of traditional rural genres such as tonada and zapateo.",
              "[10][11] Similarly, in Cuban bufo theatre at the beginning of the 20th century, the guarachas that were sung at the end of the show were referred to as rumba final despite not sharing any musical similarities with actual rumba.",
              "[12][13] Rumba instrumentation has varied historically depending on the style and the availability of the instruments.",
              "The core instruments of any rumba ensemble are the claves, two hard wooden sticks that are struck against each other, and the conga drums: quinto (lead drum, highest-pitched), tres dos (middle-pitched), and tumba or salidor (lowest-pitched).",
              "Other common instruments include the cata\u0301 or guagua, a wooden cylinder;",
              "the palitos, wooden sticks to strike the cata\u0301;",
              "shakers such as the chekere\u0301 and the maracas;",
              "scraper percussion instruments such as the gu\u0308iro;",
              "bells, and cajones, wooden boxes that preceded the congas.",
              "[2][14][15][16] During the 1940s, the genre experienced a mutual influence with son cubano, especially by Ignacio Pin\u0303eiro's Septeto Nacional and Arsenio Rodri\u0301guez's conjunto, which led to the incorporation of instruments such as the tres, the double bass, the trumpet and the piano, and the removal of idiophone instruments.",
              "[17] At the same time, Cuban big bands, in collaboration with musical artists such as Chano Pozo, began to include authentic rumbas among their dance pieces.",
              "The group AfroCuba de Matanzas, founded in 1957, added bata\u0301 drums to the traditional rumba ensemble in their style, known as bata\u0301-rumba.",
              "More recently, a cappella (vocals-only, without instruments) rumba has been performed by the Cuban ensemble Vocal Sampling, as heard in their song \"Conga Yambumba\".",
              "Although rumba is played predominantly in binary meter (duple pulse: 24, 44), triple meter (triple pulse: 98, 34) is also present.",
              "In most rumba styles, such as yambu\u0301 and guaguanco\u0301, duple pulse is primary and triple-pulse is secondary.",
              "[18] In contrast, in the rural style columbia, triple pulse is the primary structure and duple pulse is secondary.",
              "This can be explained due to the \"binarization\" of African-based ternary rhythms.[19] Both the claves and the quinto (lead drum) are responsible for establishing the rhythm.",
              "Subsequently, the other instruments play their parts supporting the lead drum.",
              "Rhythmically, rumba is based on the five-stroke guide pattern called clave and the inherent structure it conveys.",
              "[20] Yambu\u0301 and guaguanco\u0301 songs often begin with the soloist singing a melody with meaningless syllables, rather than with word-based lyrics.",
              "This introductory part is called the diana.",
              "According to Larry Crook, the diana is important because it \"also contains the first choral refrain\".",
              "The lead singer provides a melodic phrase or musical motive/theme for the choral sections, or they may present new but related material.",
              "Parallel harmonies are usually built above or below a melodic line, with \"thirds, sixths, and octaves most common.\"",
              "[21] Therefore, the singer who is singing the diana initiates the beginning of the rumba experience for the audience.",
              "The singer then improvises lyrics stating the reason for holding and performing the present rumba.",
              "This kind of improvisation is called decimar, since it is done in de\u0301cimas, ten-line stanzas.",
              "Alternatively, the singer might sing an established song.",
              "Some of the most common and recognizable rumba standards are \"Ave Maria Morena\" (yambu\u0301), \"Llora como llore\u0301\" (guaguanco\u0301), \"Cuba linda, Cuba hermosa\" (guaguanco\u0301), \"China de oro (Laye Laye)\" (columbia), and \"A Malanga\" (columbia).",
              "Rumba songs consist of two main sections.",
              "The first, the canto, features the lead vocalist, performing an extended text of verses that are sometimes partially improvised.",
              "The lead singer usually plays claves.",
              "[22] The first section may last a few minutes, until the lead vocalist signals for the other singers to repeat the short refrain of the chorus, in call and response.",
              "This second section of the song is sometimes referred to as the montuno.",
              "It should be mentioned at the outset that the history of rumba is filled with so many unknowns, contradictions, conjectures and myths which have, over time been taken as fact, that any definitive history of the genre is probably impossible to reconstruct.",
              "Even elders who were present at historic junctures in rumba\u2019s development will often disagree over the critical details of its history.",
              "David Pen\u0303alosa[23] Enslaved Africans were first brought to Cuba in the 16th century by the early Spanish settlers.",
              "Due to the significance of sugar as an export during the late 18th and early 19th century, even greater numbers of people from Africa were enslaved, brought to Cuba, and forced to work on the sugar plantations.",
              "Where large populations of enslaved Africans lived, African religion, dance, and drumming were clandestinely preserved through the generations.",
              "Cultural retention among the Bantu, Yoruba, Fon (Arara\u0301), and Efik (Abakua\u0301) had the most significant impact in western Cuba, where rumba was born.",
              "The consistent interaction of Africans and Europeans on the island brought about what today is known as Afro-Cuban culture.",
              "This is a process known as transculturation, an idea that Cuban scholar Fernando Ortiz brought to the forefront in cultural studies like Cuban Counterpoint: Tobacco and Sugar.",
              "Cuban transculturation melds Spanish culture with African cultures, as with the seamless merging found in rumba.",
              "Ortiz saw transculturation as a positive social force: \"consecrating the need for mutual understanding on an objective grounding of truth to move toward achieving the definitive integrity of the nation.\"",
              "[24] Most ethnomusicologists agree that the roots of rumba can be found in the solares of Havana and Matanzas during the 1880s.",
              "[25] The solares, also known as cuarteri\u0301as, were large houses in the poor dock neighborhoods of Havana and Matanzas.",
              "Many of the important figures in the history of rumba, from Malanga to Mongo Santamari\u0301a were raised in solares.",
              "[26] Slavery was abolished in 1886 in Cuba and first-generation of free black citizens were often called negros de nacio\u0301n, a term commonly found in the lyrics of rumba songs.",
              "[26] The earliest progenitors of the urban styles of rumba (yambu\u0301 and guaguanco\u0301) might have developed during the early 19th century in slave barracks (barracones) long before the use of the term rumba as a genre became established.",
              "[25] Such proto-rumba styles were probably instrumented with household items such as boxes and drawers instead of the congas, and frying pans, spoons and sticks instead of guaguas, palitos and claves.",
              "[25] While these early precursors of rumba have been barely documented, the direct precursors towards the mid- and late-19th century have been widely studied.",
              "Urban rumba styles are rooted in the so-called coros de clave and coros de guaguanco\u0301, street choirs that derived from the Spanish orfeones.",
              "In addition, the widespread yuka dance and music of Congolese origin became integrated into such choirs, lending its percussion instruments and dance moves.",
              "In addition, the secret Abakua\u0301 traditions rooted in the Calabar region of West Africa that prevailed in both Havana and Matanzas also influenced the development of rumba as a syncretic genre.",
              "Coros de clave were introduced by Catalan composer Jose\u0301 Anselmo Clave\u0301 and became popular between the 1880s and the 1910s.",
              "[27] They comprised as many as 150 men and women who sang in 68 time with European harmonies and instruments.",
              "Songs began with a female solo singer followed by call-and-response choral singing.",
              "As many as 60 coros de clave might have existed by 1902, some of which denied any African influence on their music.",
              "[28] Examples of popular coros de clave include El Arpa de Oro and La Juventud.",
              "From the coros the clave evolved the coros de guaguanco\u0301, which comprised mostly men, had a 24 time, and incorporated drums.[28] Famous coros de guaguanco\u0301 include El Timbre de Oro, Los Roncos (both featuring Ignacio Pin\u0303eiro, the latter as director), and Paso Franco.",
              "[29] These ensembles gave rise to the first authentic rumba groups, and with them several types of rumba emerged, including the now popular guaguanco\u0301 and yambu\u0301.",
              "However, others have been lost to time or are extremely rare today, such as the tahona,[30] papalote,[27] tonada,[31] and the jiribilla and reseda\u0301.",
              "[7] Rumba served as an expression to those who were oppressed, thus beginning a social and racial identity with rumba.",
              "The synthesis of cultures can be seen in rumba because it \"exhibits both continuity with older traditions and development of new ones.",
              "The rumba itself is a combination of music, dance, and poetry.\"",
              "[21] During slavery, and after it was abolished, rumba served as a social outlet for oppressed slaves and the underclass which was typically danced in the streets or backyards in urban areas.",
              "Rumba is believed to have grown out of the social circumstances of Havana because it \"was the center for large numbers of enslaved Africans by the end of the eighteenth century.",
              "Rebellion was difficult and dangerous, but protest in a disguised form was often expressed in recreational music and dance.\"",
              "[32] Even after slavery was abolished in Cuba, there still remained social and racial inequality, which Afro-Cubans dealt with by using rumba's music and dancing as an outlet of frustration.",
              "Because Afro-Cubans had fewer economic opportunities and the majority lived in poverty, the style of dance and music did not gain national popularity and recognition until the 1950s, and especially after the effects of the 1959 Cuban Revolution, which institutionalized it.",
              "The first commercial studio recordings of Cuban rumba were made in 1947 in New York by Carlos Vidal Bolado and Chano Pozo for SMC Pro-Arte, and in 1948 in Havana by Filiberto Sa\u0301nchez for Panart.",
              "The first commercial ensemble recordings of rumba were made in the mid 1950s by Alberto Zayas and his Conjunto Afrocubano Lulu\u0301 Yonkori, yielding the 1956 hit \"El vive bien\".",
              "The success of this song prompted the promotion of another rumba group, Los Mun\u0303equitos de Matanzas, which became extremely popular.",
              "[33] Together with Los Mun\u0303equitos, Los Papines were the first band to popularize rumba in Cuba and abroad.",
              "Their very stylized version of the genre has been considered a \"unique\" and \"innovative\" approach.",
              "[34] After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, there were many efforts by the government to institutionalize rumba, which has resulted in two different types of performances.",
              "The first was the more traditional rumba performed in a backyard with a group of friends and family without any type of governmental involvement.",
              "The second was a style dedicated to tourists while performed in a theater setting.",
              "Two institutions that promoted rumba as part of Cuban culture \u2013thus creating the tourist performance\u2013 are the Ministry of Culture and the Conjunto Folklo\u0301rico Nacional de Cuba ('Cuban Nacional Folkloric Company').",
              "As Folklo\u0301rico Nacional became more prevalent in the promotion of rumba, the dance \"shifted from its original locus, street corners, where it often shared attention with parallel activities of traffic, business, and socializing, to its secondary quarters, the professional stage, to another home, the theatrical patio.\"",
              "[35] Although Folklo\u0301rico Nacional aided in the tourist promotion of rumba, the Ministry of Culture helped successfully and safely organize rumba in the streets.",
              "In early post-revolutionary times, spontaneous rumba might have been considered problematic due to its attraction of large groups at unpredictable and spontaneous times, which caused traffic congestion in certain areas and was linked with fights and drinking.",
              "The post-revolutionary government aimed to control this \"by organizing where rumba could take place agreeable and successfully, the government, through the Ministry of Culture, moved to structurally safeguard one of its major dance/music complexes and incorporate it and Cuban artists nearer the core of official Cuban culture.\"",
              "[36] This change in administering rumba not only helped organize the dances but also helped it move away from the negative connotation of being a disruptive past time event.",
              "Although this organization helped the style of rumba develop as an aspect of national culture, it also had some negative effects.",
              "For example, one of the main differences between pre- and post-revolutionary is that after the revolution rumba became more structured and less spontaneous.",
              "For instance, musicians dancers and singers gathered together to become inspired through rumba.",
              "In other words, rumba was a form of the moment where spontaneity was essentially the sole objective.",
              "However, post-revolutionary Cuba \"led to manipulation of rumba form.",
              "It condensed the time of a rumba event to fit theater time and audience concentration tie.",

              "Freed from the confines of the traditional drum melodies, rumba became more an aesthetic, rather than a specific combination of individual parts.",
              "The most significant innovation of the late 1980s was the rumba known as guarapachangueo, created by Los Chinitos of Havana, and bata\u0301-rumba, created by AfroCuba de Matanzas.",
              "Bata\u0301-rumba initially was just a matter of combining guaguanco\u0301 and chachalokuafu\u0301n, but it has since expanded to include a variety of bata\u0301 rhythms. A review of the 2008 CD by Pedro Marti\u0301nez and Roma\u0301n Di\u0301az, The Routes of Rumba, describes guarapachangueo as follows:[41] Guarapachangueo, invented by the group Los Chinitos in Havana in the 1970s, is based on \"the interplay of beats and rests\", and is highly conversational (Jottar, 2008[42]).",
              "Far from the standardized regularity of the drum rhythms of recordings such as Alberto Zayas's \"El vive bien\", guarapachangueo often sounds slightly random or unorganized to the untrained ear, yet presents a plethora of percussive synchronicities for those who understand the clave.",
              "Using both cajones (wooden boxes) and tumbadoras (congas), Martinez and Diaz reflect the tendencies of their generation of rumberos in combining these instruments, which widens the sonic plane to include more bass and treble sounds.",
              "In their video about the history of guarapachangueo, Los Chinitos say that initially the word \"guarapachangueo\" was used by their colleague musician in a disparaging way: \"What kind of guarapachangueo are you playing?\"",
              ".",
              "[43] Pancho Quinto and his group Yoruba Andabo also played a vital role in the development of the genre.",
              "[44] The word derives from \"guarapachanga\", itself a portmanteau of \"guarapo\" and \"pachanga\" coined by composer Juan Rivera Prevot in 1961.",

              "The decline of direct Cuban musical influence in the 1960s and 70s and the decades-long circular migration patterns of Puerto Rican musicians to New York City meant that New York became the place where Puerto Ricans developed the fusion that became salsa.",
