    "query": "What is the history and cultural significance behind the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, and how has it evolved over time to become a symbolic representation of hospitality, respect, and mindfulness?",
    "response": "The traditional Japanese tea ceremony is a cultural tradition that involves preparing and serving green tea in a very particular way, with an emphasis on aesthetics, hospitality, respect, and mindfulness. It has a long history and a rich symbolism that reflects the principles of Zen Buddhism and the appreciation of the beauty in everyday life[^2^] [^5^].\n\nThe tea ceremony originated in China as a practice of Buddhist monks who drank tea to aid their meditation and ward off sleep. It was introduced to Japan in the 9th century by monks who brought tea seeds and utensils from China. At first, tea was a rare and expensive commodity that was only enjoyed by the aristocracy and the clergy. Gradually, tea drinking became more popular and widespread among different classes of society, especially after the introduction of powdered green tea (matcha) in the 12th century[^2^] [^4^].\n\nThe tea ceremony evolved into an elaborate ritual that involved specific places, procedures, and equipment for drinking tea. The ceremony took place in a tea house or a special room of the house, which was designed to create a sense of rustic simplicity and harmony with nature. The room had an alcove where a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement were displayed, and a fireplace or a brazier where the water was heated. The guests entered through a small door that symbolized humility and left behind their worldly concerns[^2^] [^3^].\n\nThe host prepared and served the tea with grace and precision, following a set of rules and etiquette that governed every aspect of the ceremony. The host also offered the guests special sweets that complemented the taste of the tea. The guests observed and appreciated the utensils, the decorations, the garden, and the atmosphere of the tea room. They also engaged in polite conversation on topics such as art, poetry, philosophy, or history. The tea ceremony was meant to be a moment of calmness, harmony, and mutual respect between the host and the guests[^2^] [^3^].\n\nThe tea ceremony was influenced by various historical and cultural factors over time. One of the most influential figures was Sen Rikyu (1522-1591), a tea master who served under two powerful warlords: Oda Nobunaga (1534-1582) and Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537-1598). Sen Rikyu refined the tea ceremony to its essence, emphasizing simplicity, naturalness, and sincerity. He also advocated for wabi-cha, a style of tea that favored plain utensils and rustic settings over lavish ones. Sen Rikyu's teachings influenced many schools of tea that developed after his death[^2^] [^4^].\n\nToday, the tea ceremony is still practiced by many people in Japan and around the world as a way of preserving and celebrating a unique aspect of Japanese culture. It is also seen as a form of art, meditation, education, and social interaction that can enrich one's life and spirit[^1^] [^5^].",

              "An elaborate ceremony for its preparation and consumption developed which sought to foster the appreciation and beauty of life's simple luxuries.",
              "In addition, tea drinkers were able to discreetly display their good taste and wealth not only by serving what was a relatively expensive commodity but by reserving their very best porcelain for drinking it.",
              "With books written by tea experts on how to conduct oneself and appreciate the tea fully, along with poems eulogising the beverage, tea drinking was developed into an art form.",
              "The tea ceremony, thus, became a simple way to escape for a moment the tribulations of one's often hectic everyday life, a function drinking tea still has for many people today.",
              "Japanese Tea Ceremonymrhayata (CC BY-SA) In both Chinese and Japanese tradition, the discovery of tea is credited to the Indian sage Bodhidharma (aka Daruma), the founder of Zen Buddhism.",
              "Bodhidharma, travelling to spread the word of his new doctrine, founded the Shaolin temple in southern China (Shorinji to the Japanese).",
              "There he meditated while sat facing a wall for nine long years.",
              "At the end of that period his legs had withered away and, just on the verge of reaching enlightenment, he fell asleep.",
              "Enraged at missing this last step, he ripped off his own eyelids and threw them to the ground.",
              "From these a bush grew, the tea plant.",
              "Tea goes by various names: cha in Chinese and Japanese or chai in Hindi and Urdu.",
              "The English name probably derives from the pronunciation of the drink (the) in the province of Fujian, south-east China.",
              "The drink is made by adding hot water to the young leaves, leaf tips, and leaf buds of the plant Camellia sinensis which is native to south-west China.",
              "The drink was first used by Buddhist monks from around the 2nd century BCE to support them while they meditated and to ward off sleep.",
              "Tea was also thought to possess medicinal qualities, curing a hangover being one of them.",
              "By the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) tea had spread beyond the monasteries and become a popular drink with the gentry who were the only people who could afford such an expensive drink.",
              "Tea became an important element of the economy, with large estates in the south-east of the country cultivating the plant and providing the government with valuable tax revenue on its sale.",
              "Tea merchants, who were now exporting it to other Asian countries, were amongst the richest businessmen in China.",
              "The trend for tea-drinking also created a boom in the fine ceramics people preferred to use to brew, mix, and drink it from, and the elegant jars they used to store their tea leaves in.",

              "In a culture where ostentatious displays of wealth were frowned upon as vulgar, the use of a simple but expensive ceramic tea bowl was all that was needed to show one's prosperity.",
              "Chinese Tea Bowl & StandThe British Museum (Copyright) Tea drinking became such an integral part of the Chinese culture that it began to appear in art and literature.",
              "One famous poem by Lu Yu appeared in his 8th-century CE treatise on the forms and conventions which should be applied when drinking tea.",
              "The poem is a thank you note after Yu had received a gift of a packet of freshly picked tea.",
              "To honour the tea, I shut my brushwood gate, Lest common folk intrude, And donned my gauze cap To brew and taste it on my own.",

              "(in Ebrey, 95) Along with other cultural practices, tea drinking was passed on from China to neighbouring East Asian countries such as the Silla kingdom of Korea but nowhere did it become more popular than in Japan from the 6th or 7th century CE.",
              "In Japan, too, it was Buddhist monks who first drank tea, and it did not become fashionable until around 1200 CE.",
              "As China cultivated better tea plants than those available in Japan, these too were imported and not just the cut leaves.",
              "In Japan, tea was usually prepared by pounding the leaves and making a ball with amazura (a sweetener from grapes) or ginger which was then left to brew in hot water.",
              "Eventually, again from 1200 CE, specialised tea schools were opened and people reserved their finest porcelain for tea drinking.",
              "Although the ritual and ceremony which developed when serving tea originated in China, it is the Japanese who have made it synonymous with their culture.",
              "The Japanese Tea Ceremony is called chanoyu, meaning 'hot water for tea', or chado or sado, meaning 'way of the tea'.",
              "Tea parties began as rather rowdy affairs where guests tried to guess the type of tea they were drinking but the 15th-century CE shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa put a stop to all that and made the whole thing a much more sober and subdued event, offering the ruling class a perfect setting for discrete conversation on sensitive subjects.",
              "The ceremony typifies the Japanese aesthetic principle of wabi, which is the value given to the appreciation of beauty and simplicity in everyday things.",
              "The application of wabi to the tea ceremony is credited to the 16th-century CE tea master Sen no Rikyu (1522-1591 CE).",
              "Rikyu was master of the tea ceremonies of the warlords Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and he also promoted the use of carefully arranged flowers (ikebana) to create just the right atmosphere of calm when drinking tea.",
              "Rikyu's masters did not always listen to him it seems for Hideyoshi famously threw a tea party for 800 guests to celebrate his victory in Kyushu in 1587 CE.",
              "Still, the monk had more success with subsequent generations as the tea ceremony gradually became more and more genteel and intimate.",
              "Tea House at Koishikawa by HokusaiKatsushika Hokusai (Public Domain) The first thing to do when drinking tea was to put oneself in the right place and for the Japanese that was the dedicated chashitsu or tea room, also known as a sukiya or 'house of the imperfect', alluding to the structure's original simple architecture and basic materials.",
              "Roofs were in bamboo and thatch, supporting columns were unworked, and the walls made of earth.",
              "This rustic building was quite separate from the main residence (immediately stamping an aristocratic requirement on the ceremony as only those with money could obviously afford such a thing).",
              "Thus, the drinker or drinkers were immediately detached from the everyday living space and so, by extension, their everyday lives.",
              "Three original tea rooms still exist today and are listed as National Treasures of Japan.",
              "They are to be found in the Myoki-an of Yamasaki, within the Shinto shrine of Minase-gu, and at the Saiho-ji monastery in Kyoto.",
              "The tea room was small, only three metres square usually;",
              "Rikyu is credited with downsizing the previously larger rooms. It had minimal decor and services: a toilet and a tsukubai, which consists of a stone basin (chozu-bachi) outside for cleaning the hands before entering along with several irregular stones placed nearby in an aesthetically pleasing manner.",
              "Another feature is a stone, free-standing lantern, also outside.",
              "Ideally, the tea room should stand in its own small garden (cha-niwa) which has a stepping stone path (tobi-ishi) leading from the main house.",
              "The desired greenery was evergreens rather than flowers, and moss or grass underfoot to begin the calming effect of the ceremony before even entering the tea room.",
              "The doorways of tea rooms were usually small, only around 90 cm (3 ft) high, which was meant to show that all were of equal status once inside.",
              "Some historians believe the door prevented swords being taken into the tea room in another way to demonstrate rank and occupation were to be abandoned while drinking tea.",
              "Windows and paper screens gave plenty of light to the interior.",
              "Movement of \"Tea\" & \"Cha\" Around the GlobeSimeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-SA) The details and etiquette of how the tea was brewed and served using a special ladle or the restrained gestures one should employ all depended on which school of tea ceremony one adhered too, and there were many.",
              "Water was usually boiled over charcoal in an iron kettle, and the tea was strong, green and bitter.",
              "Common, too, to all ceremonies was the requirement to use the finest porcelain one could, especially the tea bowl or chawan, actually used to drink from.",

              "The third expelled the dullness from my mind, Sharpening inspiration gained from all the books I've read.",
              "The fourth brought forth light perspiration, Dispersing a lifetime's troubles through my pores.",

              "The sixth has made me kin to the Immortals.",
              "The seventh is the utmost I can drink - A light breeze issues from my armpits.",
              "(in Ebrey, 95) Along with other cultural practices, tea drinking was passed on from China to neighbouring East Asian countries such as the Silla kingdom of Korea but nowhere did it become more popular than in Japan from the 6th or 7th century CE.",
              "In Japan, too, it was Buddhist monks who first drank tea, and it did not become fashionable until around 1200 CE.",
              "As China cultivated better tea plants than those available in Japan, these too were imported and not just the cut leaves.",
              "In Japan, tea was usually prepared by pounding the leaves and making a ball with amazura (a sweetener from grapes) or ginger which was then left to brew in hot water.",
              "Eventually, again from 1200 CE, specialised tea schools were opened and people reserved their finest porcelain for tea drinking.",
              "Although the ritual and ceremony which developed when serving tea originated in China, it is the Japanese who have made it synonymous with their culture.",
              "The Japanese Tea Ceremony is called chanoyu, meaning 'hot water for tea', or chado or sado, meaning 'way of the tea'.",
              "Tea parties began as rather rowdy affairs where guests tried to guess the type of tea they were drinking but the 15th-century CE shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa put a stop to all that and made the whole thing a much more sober and subdued event, offering the ruling class a perfect setting for discrete conversation on sensitive subjects.",
              "The ceremony typifies the Japanese aesthetic principle of wabi, which is the value given to the appreciation of beauty and simplicity in everyday things.",
              "The application of wabi to the tea ceremony is credited to the 16th-century CE tea master Sen no Rikyu (1522-1591 CE).",
              "Rikyu was master of the tea ceremonies of the warlords Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and he also promoted the use of carefully arranged flowers (ikebana) to create just the right atmosphere of calm when drinking tea.",
              "Rikyu's masters did not always listen to him it seems for Hideyoshi famously threw a tea party for 800 guests to celebrate his victory in Kyushu in 1587 CE.",
              "Still, the monk had more success with subsequent generations as the tea ceremony gradually became more and more genteel and intimate.",
              "Tea House at Koishikawa by HokusaiKatsushika Hokusai (Public Domain) The first thing to do when drinking tea was to put oneself in the right place and for the Japanese that was the dedicated chashitsu or tea room, also known as a sukiya or 'house of the imperfect', alluding to the structure's original simple architecture and basic materials.",
              "Roofs were in bamboo and thatch, supporting columns were unworked, and the walls made of earth.",
              "This rustic building was quite separate from the main residence (immediately stamping an aristocratic requirement on the ceremony as only those with money could obviously afford such a thing).",
              "Thus, the drinker or drinkers were immediately detached from the everyday living space and so, by extension, their everyday lives.",
              "Three original tea rooms still exist today and are listed as National Treasures of Japan.",
              "They are to be found in the Myoki-an of Yamasaki, within the Shinto shrine of Minase-gu, and at the Saiho-ji monastery in Kyoto.",
              "The tea room was small, only three metres square usually;",
              "Rikyu is credited with downsizing the previously larger rooms. It had minimal decor and services: a toilet and a tsukubai, which consists of a stone basin (chozu-bachi) outside for cleaning the hands before entering along with several irregular stones placed nearby in an aesthetically pleasing manner.",
              "Another feature is a stone, free-standing lantern, also outside.",
              "Ideally, the tea room should stand in its own small garden (cha-niwa) which has a stepping stone path (tobi-ishi) leading from the main house.",
              "The desired greenery was evergreens rather than flowers, and moss or grass underfoot to begin the calming effect of the ceremony before even entering the tea room.",
              "The doorways of tea rooms were usually small, only around 90 cm (3 ft) high, which was meant to show that all were of equal status once inside.",
              "Some historians believe the door prevented swords being taken into the tea room in another way to demonstrate rank and occupation were to be abandoned while drinking tea.",
              "Windows and paper screens gave plenty of light to the interior.",
              "Movement of \"Tea\" & \"Cha\" Around the GlobeSimeon Netchev (CC BY-NC-SA) The details and etiquette of how the tea was brewed and served using a special ladle or the restrained gestures one should employ all depended on which school of tea ceremony one adhered too, and there were many.",
              "Water was usually boiled over charcoal in an iron kettle, and the tea was strong, green and bitter.",
              "Common, too, to all ceremonies was the requirement to use the finest porcelain one could, especially the tea bowl or chawan, actually used to drink from.",

              "Tea was introduced to Europe in 1607 CE and, by the 19th century CE, the drink had become so popular in Europe that drinkers could choose from Chinese, Indian, and Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) tea.",
              "Tea from the latter two countries was stronger and so was preferred, especially with the British who had encouraged its cultivation in colonial India.",

              "The history of tea in Japan began as early as the 8th century, when the first known references were made in Japanese records.",
              "Tea became a drink of the religious classes in Japan when Japanese priests and envoys sent to China to learn about its culture brought tea to Japan.",
              "The Buddhist monks Ku\u0304kai and Saicho\u0304 may have been the first to bring tea seeds to Japan.",
              "The first form of tea brought from China was probably brick tea.",
              "Tea became a drink of the royal classes when Emperor Saga encouraged the growth of tea plants.",
              "Seeds were imported from China, and cultivation in Japan began.",
              "Tea consumption became popular among the gentry during the 12th century, after the publication of Eisai's Kissa Yo\u0304jo\u0304ki.",
              "Uji, with its strategic location near the capital at Kyoto, became Japan's first major tea-producing region during this period.",
              "Beginning in the 13th and 14th centuries, Japanese tea culture developed the distinctive features for which it is known today, and the Japanese tea ceremony emerged as a key component of that culture.",
              "In the following centuries, production increased and tea became a staple of the general public.",
              "The development of sencha in the 18th century led to the creation of distinctive new styles of green tea which now dominate tea consumption in Japan.",
              "In the 19th and 20th centuries, industrialization and automation transformed the Japanese tea industry into a highly efficient operation, capable of producing large quantities of tea despite Japan's limited arable land area.",
              "The first Japanese contact with tea most likely occurred in the 8th century during the Nara period, when Japan sent several diplomatic missions to Chang'an, the capital of China's Tang dynasty.",
              "These early delegations brought back knowledge of Chinese culture and practices, as well as paintings, literature, and other artifacts.",
              "[1] The Chakyo\u0304 Sho\u0304setsu indicates that Emperor Sho\u0304mu served powdered tea to a hundred monks in 729, but there is some uncertainty regarding the reliability of the text.",
              "[2] In 804, the Buddhist monks Ku\u0304kai and Saicho\u0304 arrived in China to study religion as part of a government-sponsored mission during the Heian period.",
              "The Sho\u0304ryo\u0304shu\u0304, written in 814, mentions that Ku\u0304kai drank tea during his time in China.",
              "He returned to Japan in 806.",
              "[2] Ku\u0304kai is also the first to use the term chanoyu (\u8336\u306e\u6e6f), which later came to refer specifically to the Japanese tea ceremony.",
              "[3] Upon their return to Japan, Ku\u0304kai and Saicho\u0304 founded the Shingon and Tendai schools of Buddhism, respectively.",
              "One or both of them are thought to have brought back the first tea seeds to Japan during this trip.",
              "[1] Saicho\u0304, who returned in 805, is often credited for being the first to plant tea seeds in Japan, although the documentary evidence is uncertain.",
              "[3] The book Kuiku\u0304 Kokushi records that in 815, a Buddhist abbot served tea to Emperor Saga.",
              "This is the earliest reliable reference to tea drinking in Japan.",
              "Subsequently, the emperor is said to have ordered the establishment of five tea plantations near the capital.",
              "[4][5] The reign of Emperor Saga was characterized by his sinophilia, which included a passion for tea.",
              "He was fond of Chinese poetry, much of which praised the benefits of tea.",
              "Emperor Saga's poetry, and that of others at his imperial court, also make references to the drinking of tea.",
              "[6][7] Subsequent writings from the Heian period indicate that tea was cultivated and consumed on a small scale by Buddhist monks as part of their religious practice, and that the imperial family and members of the nobility also drank tea.",
              "The practice, however, was not yet popular outside these circles.",
              "[1] In the three centuries after Emperor Saga's death, interest in Tang Chinese culture declined, as did the practice of drinking tea.",
              "[8] Records from this period continued to recognize its value as a medicinal beverage and stimulant,[9] and there are mentions of it being consumed with milk, a practice that subsequently died out.",
              "[5] The form of tea consumed in Japan at this time was most likely brick tea (\u56e3\u8336, dancha), which was the standard form in China during the Tang dynasty.",
              "[10] The world's first monograph on tea, Lu Yu's The Classic of Tea, was written a few decades before the time of Ku\u0304kai and Saicho\u0304.",
              "In it, Lu Yu describes the process for steaming, roasting, and compressing the tea into bricks, as well as the process of grinding the tea into powder and stirring it to a froth in hot water prior to consumption.",
              "[11] This procedure is thought to have evolved into the method of preparing powdered matcha that later emerged in Japan.",
              "[12] The Zen monk Eisai, founder of the Rinzai school of Buddhism, is generally credited for popularizing tea in Japan.",
              "[1] In 1191, Eisai returned from a trip to China and brought back tea seeds which he planted on the island of Hirado and in the mountains of Kyushu.",
              "[8] He also gave some seeds to the monk Myo\u0304e, abbot of the Ko\u0304zan-ji temple in Kyoto.",
              "Myo\u0304e planted these seeds in Toganoo (\u6802\u5c3e) and Uji, which became the sites of the first large scale cultivation of tea in Japan.",
              "At first, Toganoo tea was seen as the finest in Japan and was called \"real tea\" (\u672c\u8336, honcha), as opposed to \"non-tea\" (\u975e\u8336, hicha) produced elsewhere in Japan.",
              "By the 15th century, however, Uji tea surpassed that of Toganoo, and the terms honcha and hicha came to refer to Uji tea and non-Uji tea, respectively.",
              "[8][13] In 1211, Eisai wrote the first edition of the Kissa Yo\u0304jo\u0304ki (\u55ab\u8336\u990a\u751f\u8a18, Drink Tea and Prolong Life), the first Japanese treatise on tea.",
              "[1][14] The Kissa Yo\u0304jo\u0304ki promotes the drinking of tea for health purposes.",
              "It opens with the statement that \"Tea is the most wonderful medicine for nourishing one's health;",
              "it is the secret of long life.\"",
              "The preface describes how drinking tea can have a positive effect on the five vital organs (a concept in traditional Chinese medicine).",
              "Eisai subscribed to a theory that the five organs each preferred foods with different flavors, and he concluded that because tea is bitter, and \"the heart loves bitter things\", it would especially benefit the heart.",
              "[14] Eisai goes on to list the many purported health effects of tea, which include curing fatigue, lupus, indigestion, beriberi disease, heart disease, and so on, in addition to quenching thirst.",
              "[15] The Kissa Yo\u0304jo\u0304ki also explains the shapes of tea plants, tea flowers and tea leaves and covers how to grow tea plants and process tea leaves.",
              "[citation needed] The treatise says little regarding the drinking of tea for pleasure, however, focusing instead on its medicinal value.",
              "[16] Eisai was instrumental in introducing tea consumption to the samurai class.",
              "[1] He presented a version of his Kissa Yo\u0304jo\u0304ki in 1214 to sho\u0304gun Minamoto no Sanetomo, who had been suffering from a hangover after drinking too much sake.",
              "Eisai also served tea to the young sho\u0304gun.",
              "[8][14] Zen Buddhism, as advocated by Eisai and others, also became popular during this period, particularly among the warrior class.",
              "[15] The Zen monk Do\u0304gen promulgated a set of rules for Buddhist temples based on Rules of Purity for Chan Monasteries, a Chinese text of 1103.",
              "Do\u0304gen's text included notes on etiquette for the serving of tea in Buddhist rituals.",
              "[8] Tea was considered central to practitioners of Zen Buddhism.",
              "Muso\u0304 Soseki went as far as to state that \"tea and Zen are one\".",
              "[17] Soon, green tea became a staple among cultured people in Japan\u2014a brew for the gentry and the Buddhist priesthood alike.",
              "Production grew and tea became increasingly accessible, though still a privilege enjoyed mostly by the upper classes.",
              "In the 14th century, tea competitions (\u9b25\u8336, to\u0304cha) emerged as a popular pastime.",
              "Unlike tea competitions in China, the object of to\u0304cha was to distinguish between tea grown in different regions, in particular between honcha and hicha.",
              "[18] These events were known for their extravagant betting.",
              "Samurai Sasaki Do\u0304yo\u0304 was particularly famed for hosting such competitions, with lavish decoration, large quantities of food and sake, and dancing.",
              "This taste for the extravagant and the vulgar was known as basara (\u5a46\u5a11\u7f85) and was the cause of some moral outrage among writers of the time.",
              "[19] Also popular during this period was a passion for Chinese objects (\u5510\u3082\u306e, karamono), such as paintings, ceramics, and calligraphy.",
              "[20] In the 15th century, Sho\u0304gun Ashikaga Yoshimasa constructed the first tea room in the shoin chanoyu (reception room tea ceremony) style.",
              "This simple room in his retirement villa at Ginkaku-ji allowed the sho\u0304gun to display his karamono objects when holding tea ceremonies.",
              "[20] The shoin style room developed from the study rooms of Zen monks.",
              "They featured wall-to-wall tatami covering in contrast to earlier plain wooden floors, and a shoin desk (writing desk) built into the wall.",
              "These rooms were the predecessors of modern Japanese living rooms.[21] The austerity of this new style of tea room (\u8336\u5ba4, chashitsu) is thought to have been a step towards the formal chanoyu tea ceremony that emerged later.",
              "[22] It is said that Yoshimasa's tea master was Murata Shuko\u0304, also known as Murata Juko\u0304.",
              "[20] Shuko\u0304 is credited with developing the muted, \"cold and withered\" motifs of the Japanese tea ceremony.",
              "He advocated combining imported Chinese wares with rough ceramics made in Japan, in an effort to \"harmonize Japanese and Chinese tastes\".",
              "This intentional usage of simple or flawed utensils with a wabi aesthetic came to be referred to as wabicha.",
              "[23] Shuko\u0304, however, did not embrace the idea of a fully wabi approach to chanoyu.",
              "[24] By contrast, Takeno Jo\u0304o\u0304, who studied under one of Shuko\u0304's disciples, was dedicated to the elaboration of the wabi style in tea utensils as well as the decor of the tea room.",
              "The historical figure considered most influential in the development of the Japanese tea ceremony was Sen no Rikyu\u0304.",
              "Rikyu\u0304 served as tea master to both daimyos Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.",
              "He lived during the upheavals of the Sengoku period, in which political and social structures were radically transformed.",
              "Rikyu\u0304 grew up in Sakai, where the wealthy merchant class was able to establish itself as a cultural and economic force capable of shaping Japanese tea culture.",
              "[25] Rikyu\u0304, the son of a Sakai fish merchant, studied tea under Takeno Jo\u0304o\u0304.",
              "Like Jo\u0304o\u0304, he was a proponent of the wabi style of tea.",
              "[26] At this time, the tea ceremony played a prominent role in politics and diplomacy.",
              "Nobunaga went as far as to prohibit anyone other than his closest allies from practicing it.",
              "[26] The austere wabicha style Rikyu\u0304 advocated was less favored for these political gatherings than the more lavish mainstream style.",
              "After Nobunaga's death, Sen no Rikyu\u0304 entered the service of Hideyoshi and constructed a simple wabi tea hut called Taian, which became one of Hideyoshi's favorite tea rooms.[27] In contrast to the shingled roof preferred by Shuko\u0304, Rikyu\u0304 specified a thatched roof.",
              "[28] Called the \"North Pole of Japanese aesthetics\", this room exemplifies the rustic wabi style that came to dominate Japanese tea culture.",
              "[25] In addition to the rustic tea room, Rikyu\u0304 established the etiquette of the modern tea ceremony as well as the ordained procedure and the choice of utensils to be used.",
              "[29] He also developed the idea of the nijiriguchi, a small entryway through which guests must crawl to enter the tea room.",
              "[27][30] Though Hideyoshi forced Rikyu\u0304 to commit seppuku in 1591, Rikyu\u0304's descendants were allowed to continue in their profession.",
              "The three main schools of the traditional Japanese tea ceremony today, the Omotesenke, Urasenke, and Mushako\u0304jisenke, were all founded by children of Sen no So\u0304tan, Rikyu\u0304's grandson.",
              "[25] Developments in the Japanese tea ceremony during the Sengoku period motivated new trends in Japanese teaware.",
              "Rikyu\u0304's disciple Furuta Oribe served as Hideyoshi's tea master after Rikyu\u0304's death.",
              "Oribe's preference for green and black glazes and irregular shapes led to a new style of pottery called Oribe ware.",
              "[29] Rikyu\u0304 also influenced Japanese tastes in ceramics, rejecting the smooth regularity of Chinese-influenced tenmoku ware in favor of uneven rice bowls produced by ethnic Korean potters in Japan.",
              "This style of tea bowl or chawan was called raku ware after the name of the Korean potter who produced the first pieces for Rikyu\u0304's tea ceremonies, and is known for its appropriately wabi look and feel.",
              "[29] Modern Japanese matcha is made by grinding loose dry tea leaves (rather than the bricks of tea originally introduced from China) into powder.",
              "Matcha's sweet flavor and deep green color are created by shading the tea leaves from the sun in the last weeks before plucking, increasing the chlorophyll and decreasing the tannin content of the leaves.",
              "[31] This technique emerged in the 16th century among Uji tea growers.",
              "[32] It is also used to produce gyokuro.",

              "Influenced by China's Ming dynasty, steeped loose leaf tea emerged as an alternative to powdered tea, leading to the development of sencha.",
              "By the 14th century, the practice of drinking powdered brick tea had fallen out of fashion in China.",
              "Instead, most tea was hand-fired over a dry wok to stop the process of oxidation and purchased as loose leaves rather than compressed bricks.",
              "[33] At first, the loose leaves would still be ground into a powder and whisked with hot water to produce the finished beverage.",
              "By the late 16th century, however, tea connoisseurs were steeping the leaves in hot water in teapots and pouring the tea into teacups.",
              "[34] This new way of producing and drinking tea arrived in Japan in the 17th century.",
              "[34] Its advocates, most notably the monk Baisao, were opposed to the strict rituals of the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, which was based around the older practices of powdered tea.",
              "Instead, they promoted a carefree, informal approach to tea, inspired by ancient Chinese sages and the scholar-recluse tradition.",
              "[35][36] The method of steeping loose tea leaves in hot water came to be known as \"boiled tea\" (\u714e\u8336, sencha), and it soon led to a new way of producing green tea that would work well with this technique.",
              "In 1737, an Uji-based tea grower named Nagatani So\u0304en developed what is now the standard process for making leaf teas in Japan: tea leaves are first steamed, then rolled into narrow needles and dried in an oven.",
              "[37][38] The process imparts a vivid emerald color to the leaf, along with a \"clean\", sometimes sweet flavor.",
              "[39] Nagatani's tea caught the attention of Baisao,[37] becoming synonymous with the sencha method of steeping tea.",
              "It thereafter came to be known by the same name.",
              "Sencha grew in popularity over time and is now the most popular form of tea in Japan, representing 80 percent of all tea produced each year.",
              "[40] At the end of the Meiji era (1868\u20131912), machine manufacturing of green tea was introduced and began replacing handmade tea.",
              "Machines took over the processes of primary drying, tea rolling, secondary drying, final rolling, and steaming.",
              "In the 20th century, automation contributed to improved quality and reduced labour.",
              "Sensor and computer controls were introduced to machine automation so unskilled workers can produce superior tea without compromising quality."

              "The act of tea drinking was a way in which one could \u201ccultivate the mind and improve moral integrity\u201d and it was admired as a drink that was pure of content and consisting of elegant qualities.",
              "The discovery of tea goes back to the early history of China and, through time, has been developed into an important subject of various forms of art, significant social events, intense competitions, and daily activities.",
              "Poems were written about its unique qualities and paintings were created by its inspiration.",
              "Tea also became a staple for devout Buddhist monks who appreciated its close tie to nature, its medicinal value, and its ability to chase away drowsiness during long sessions of meditation.",
              "Through trade, tea spread from Chine to Japan, as well as numerous other countries around the world.",
              "In Japan, the use of tea went through several transformations from the time of its introduction, with the tea ceremony eventually developing into a highly ritualized and religious event while in China the tea ceremony remained mainly a time for social gatherings and quiet relaxation.",
              "For the Chinese, the tea plant has been held in high esteem for its various valuable qualities: its medicinal properties, its ability to restore wakefulness, its close tie to nature, its relative inexpensiveness, and, overall, its distinct and desirable taste.",
              "However, the appreciation for all of those qualities was not fully present at the beginning of its use;",
              "the appreciation for tea as a drink had to develop over a fairly long period of time.",
              "The use of tea dates back to 2737 BCE during the reign of the Chinese Emperor, Shennong, who is given credit for having been the one to discover the beverage.",
              "The legend states that, one afternoon, Shennong was taking a walk when he decided to stop and rest under a tree.",
              "A servant then presented Shennong with a cup of boiled water to drink (water was boiled during this time for hygienic reasons) when a leaf from the tree he was sitting under fell into his cup of water and began to steep.",
              "The Emperor, being a scientist, decided to taste the water when he saw that the leaf made it turn a light brown color.",
              "Enthralled with the aromatic scent and floral taste, the emperor decided that this should be a drink in China.",
              "While this legend may hold several truths, it is generally believed by scholars that tea and tea-drinking underwent about four major phases before becoming the drink that most people are familiar with today.",
              "The first phase began before, and continued into, the Spring and Autumn Period (770 BCE \u2013 476 CE).",
              "During this phase, tea leaves were mainly picked to be eaten as a source of food.",
              "The leaves were later discovered to have medicinal value that was used to aide in curing numerous ailments such as digestive issues.",
              "The second phase took place starting in the Pre-Qin Period (before 221 BCE) and continued on into the Eastern and Western Han dynasties (207 BCE \u2013 189 CE).",
              "Here, tea was used for the first time as a beverage when it was mixed with millet, along with other condiments according to taste preference, and was then boiled until it became a drink with a porridge-like consistency.",
              "Come the time of the Tang Dynasty (618 \u2013 907 CE), the third phase was beginning as the Chinese began grinding dried tea leaves into a powder and then leaving them to steep in boiling water.",
              "It was also during this dynasty, in the early 800\u2019s, that tea made its way to Japan in this powdered form, which will be discussed further at a later point.",
              "When the Song Dynasty (960 \u2013 1127) came to power, this form of tea-drinking had become the preferred method of consuming the beverage.",
              "Although powdered tea prevailed in popularity starting in the Tang Dynasty, another method was also developed that would slowly but surely gain in momentum: roasting and baking.",
              "This method pushed tea-drinking into what could be considered the fourth and final phase of tea development.",
              "The process involved picking the young and tender green tea leaves in the spring, roasting and baking them, and then \u201cmaking them into whole separate tea leaves\u201d.",
              "However, even though this method of tea-drinking existed in the Tang and Song dynasties, it was not until the Ming (1368 \u2013 1644) and Qing (1644 \u2013 1912) dynasties that whole leaf tea became the predominant way to drink tea in China.",
              "Tea is an important aspect of Chinese and Japanese culture because it embodies so many important aspects of both cultures.",

              "Breaking off a chunk of a green tea brick that was then turned to a fine powder with mortar and pestle before whisking the powder in hot water made for a tasty beverage that helped the monks stay awake during their long sessions of meditation.",
              "But while tea powder was given up on in China at some point, the concept was particularly embraced by Japanese monks.",
              "Eisai wrote a book not only about how to drink green tea but also about various health benefits and positive effects on the human body, called the kissa yojoki (\u55ab\u8336\u990a\u751f\u8a18), or \u201cOn Drinking Tea for One\u2019s Health\u201d.",

              "After studying tea and Zen principles in his early life, he became the tea master of the famous samurai Oda Nobunaga in 1579 and was, after Nobunaga\u2019s death, employed by Hideyoshi Toyotomi.",

              "The fact that Rikyu served as a tea master at the Imperial Palace and was close to and respected by many politically powerful people made Rikyu\u2019s teaching highly regarded by everyone, and his life\u2019s work had an impact on the tea ceremony, whose effect can be seen even today in the Japanese tea culture.",

              "So, having a certain \"Chaki\" given by Nobunaga was a great status symbol among the lords of that time.",

              "In 1585, Hideyoshi prepared a vital tea ceremony for the then-Emperor of Japan, Emperor Ogimachi.",
              "This tea gathering was held at the Imperial Palace, but anyone who wanted to enter the palace required specific credentials.",

              "This moment of surprise and amusement that he created only for Hideyoshi's tea ceremony is the Japanese philosophy of \u2018Ichi-go Ichi-e\u2019 at its finest, a philosophy that means \"One time, one meeting,\" implying that a chance to meet someone is a lifetime opportunity, so even if we are meeting the same person often, we have to treasure every single meeting with that person as the only one and make the best out of it.",

              "Wabi-Sabi has its roots in Zen Buddhism, and it is finding beauty in the imperfection, impermanence, and simple things of the world.",
              "He made the design of the 'Cha-shitsu (tearoom)' minimalistic and started to use simple everyday objects as tea equipment.",
