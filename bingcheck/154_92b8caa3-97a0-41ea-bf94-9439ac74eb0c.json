    "query": "What is the history and evolution of video game technology, and how have advancements in graphics and gameplay impacted the industry and its audience?",
    "response": "That's a very broad and interesting question. Video game technology has a long and rich history that spans from the 1950s to the present day. Here are some of the main points and milestones in the evolution of video games:\n\n- The first video games were created by computer scientists as experiments or demonstrations on minicomputers and mainframes in the 1950s and 1960s[^3^]. Some of the earliest examples are OXO (1952), Tennis for Two (1958) and Spacewar! (1962).\n- The first home console was the Magnavox Odyssey, invented by Ralph Baer and released in 1972. It used cartridges that could play different games on a television screen[^1^] [^2^].\n- The golden age of arcade games began in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with games like Space Invaders (1978), Pac-Man (1980) and Donkey Kong (1981) becoming hugely popular and influential[^1^] [^2^] [^5^].\n- The second generation of home consoles was dominated by Atari 2600, which introduced joysticks and color graphics. It also faced competition from other systems like Intellivision, ColecoVision and Vectrex[^1^].\n- The video game crash of 1983 was caused by a saturation of low-quality games, especially for the Atari 2600, and a rise of personal computers as gaming platforms. Many companies went bankrupt or left the industry[^1^] [^2^].\n- The third generation of home consoles was led by Nintendo, which released the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985. It revived the industry with its high-quality games, such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda and Metroid. Sega also entered the market with its Master System[^1^] [^2^].\n- The fourth generation of home consoles saw the introduction of 16-bit graphics and sound, as well as handheld devices like the Game Boy. Sega challenged Nintendo's dominance with its Mega Drive (Genesis), which had faster processing and more mature games. Other systems included TurboGrafx-16, Neo Geo and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)[^1^] [^2^].\n- The fifth generation of home consoles marked the transition to 3D graphics and CD-ROMs, as well as online gaming. Sony's PlayStation became the best-selling console of this era, with games like Final Fantasy VII, Metal Gear Solid and Gran Turismo. Other systems included Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and Atari Jaguar[^1^] [^2^].\n- The sixth generation of home consoles featured more powerful hardware and more diverse genres, such as open-world, stealth and rhythm games. Sony's PlayStation 2 was the most successful console of all time, with over 150 million units sold. Other systems included Sega Dreamcast, Nintendo GameCube, Microsoft Xbox and Nokia N-Gage[^1^] [^2^].\n- The seventh generation of home consoles introduced motion controls, high-definition graphics and online services. Nintendo's Wii was the best-selling console of this era, with its innovative Wii Remote and games like Wii Sports, Wii Fit and Mario Kart Wii. Other systems included Sony's PlayStation 3, Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's DS[^1^] [^2^].\n- The eighth generation of home consoles focused on social media integration, cloud gaming and virtual reality. Sony's PlayStation 4 was the leader of this era, with games like Uncharted 4, God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn. Other systems included Microsoft's Xbox One, Nintendo's Wii U and Switch, and Sony's PlayStation Vita[^1^] [^2^].\n- The ninth generation of home consoles is the current era, which began in 2020 with the release of Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S. These systems feature ray tracing, faster loading times and backward compatibility. Nintendo's Switch continues to be popular with its hybrid design and games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 and Metroid Dread[^1^] [^2^].\n\nThe advancements in graphics and gameplay have impacted the industry and its audience in many ways. Some of these impacts are:\n\n- Video games have become more immersive, realistic and expressive, allowing players to explore different worlds, stories and characters.\n- Video games have become more accessible, diverse and inclusive, catering to different tastes, preferences and needs of players.\n- Video games have become more social, interactive",

              "The first consumer video game hardware was released in the early 1970s.",
              "The first home video game console was the Magnavox Odyssey, and the first arcade video games were Computer Space and Pong.",
              "After its home console conversions, numerous companies sprang up to capture Pong's success in both the arcade and the home by cloning the game, causing a series of boom and bust cycles due to oversaturation and lack of innovation.",
              "By the mid-1970s, low-cost programmable microprocessors replaced the discrete transistor\u2013transistor logic circuitry of early hardware, and the first ROM cartridge-based home consoles arrived, including the Atari Video Computer System (VCS).",
              "Coupled with rapid growth in the golden age of arcade video games, including Space Invaders and Pac-Man, the home console market also flourished.",
              "The 1983 video game crash in the United States was characterized by a flood of too many games, often of poor or cloned qualities, and the sector saw competition from inexpensive personal computers and new types of games being developed for them.",
              "The crash prompted Japan's video game industry to take leadership of the market, which had only suffered minor impacts from the crash.",
              "Nintendo released its Nintendo Entertainment System in the United States in 1985, helping to rebound the failing video games sector.",
              "The latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s included video games driven by improvements and standardization in personal computers and the console war competition between Nintendo and Sega as they fought for market share in the United States.",
              "The first major handheld video game consoles appeared in the 1990s, led by Nintendo's Game Boy platform.",
              "In the early 1990s, advancements in microprocessor technology gave rise to real-time 3D polygonal graphic rendering in game consoles, as well as in PCs by way of graphics cards.",
              "Optical media via CD-ROMs began to be incorporated into personal computers and consoles, including Sony's fledgling PlayStation console line, pushing Sega out of the console hardware market while diminishing Nintendo's role.",
              "By the late 1990s, the Internet also gained widespread consumer use, and video games began incorporating online elements.",
              "Microsoft entered the console hardware market in the early 2000s with its Xbox line, fearing that Sony's PlayStation positioned as a game console and entertainment device, would displace personal computers.",
              "While Sony and Microsoft continued to develop hardware for comparable top-end console features, Nintendo opted to focus on innovative gameplay.",
              "Nintendo developed the Wii with motion-sensing controls, which helped to draw in non-traditional players and helped to resecure Nintendo's position in the industry;",
              "Nintendo followed this same model in the release of the Nintendo Switch.",
              "From the 2000s and into the 2010s, the industry has seen a shift of demographics as mobile gaming on smartphones and tablets displaced handheld consoles, and casual gaming became an increasingly larger sector of the market, as well as a growth in the number of players from China and other areas not traditionally tied to the industry.",
              "To take advantage of these shifts, traditional revenue models were supplanted with ongoing revenue stream models such as free-to-play, freemium, and subscription-based games.",
              "As triple-A video game production became more costly and risk-averse, opportunities for more experimental and innovative independent game development grew over the 2000s and 2010s, aided by the popularity of mobile and casual gaming and the ease of digital distribution.",
              "Hardware and software technology continues to drive improvement in video games, with support for high-definition video at high framerates and for virtual and augmented reality-based games.",
              "As early as 1950, computer scientists were using electronic machines to construct relatively simple game systems, such as Bertie the Brain in 1950 to play tic tac toe, or Nimrod in 1951 for playing Nim.",
              "These systems used either electronic light displays and mainly as demonstration systems at large exhibitions to showcase the power of computers at the time.",
              "[1][2] Another early demonstration was Tennis for Two, a game created by William Higinbotham at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1958 for three-day exhibition, using an analog computer and an oscilloscope for a display.",
              "[3] Spacewar!",
              "is considered one of the first recognized video games that enjoyed wider distribution behind a single exhibition system.",
              "Developed in 1961 for the PDP-1 mainframe computer at MIT, it allowed two players to simulate a space combat fight on the PDP-1's relatively simplistic monitor.",
              "The game's source code was shared with other institutions with a PDP-1 across the country as the MIT students themselves moved about, allowing the game to gain popularity.",
              "[4] In the 1960s, a number of computer games were created for mainframe and minicomputer systems, but these failed to achieve wide distribution due to the continuing scarcity of computer resources, a lack of sufficiently trained programmers interested in crafting entertainment products, and the difficulty in transferring programs between computers in different geographic areas.",
              "By the end of the 1970s, however, the situation had changed drastically.",
              "The BASIC and C high-level programming languages were widely adopted during the decade, which were more accessible than earlier more technical languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL, opening up computer game creation to a larger base of users.",
              "With the advent of time-sharing, which allowed the resources of a single mainframe to be parceled out among multiple users connected to the machine by terminals, computer access was no longer limited to a handful of individuals at an institution, creating more opportunities for students to create their own games.",
              "Furthermore, the widespread adoption of the PDP-10, released by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1966, and the portable UNIX operating system, developed at Bell Labs in 1971 and released generally in 1973, created common programming environments across the country that reduced the difficulty of sharing programs between institutions.",
              "Finally, the founding of the first magazines dedicated to computing like Creative Computing (1974), the publication of the earliest program compilation books like 101 BASIC Computer Games (1973), and the spread of wide-area networks such as the ARPANET allowed programs to be shared more easily across great distances.",
              "As a result, many of the mainframe games created by college students in the 1970s influenced subsequent developments in the video game industry in ways that, Spacewar!",
              "aside, the games of the 1960s did not.",
              "In the arcade and on home consoles, fast-paced action and real-time gameplay were the norm in genres like racing and target shooting.",
              "On the mainframe, however, such games were generally not possible due both to the lack of adequate displays (many computer terminals continued to rely on teletypes rather than monitors well into the 1970s and even most CRT terminals could only render character-based graphics) and insufficient processing power and memory to update game elements in real time.",
              "While 1970s mainframes were more powerful than arcade and console hardware of the period, the need to parcel out computing resources to dozens of simultaneous users via time-sharing significantly hampered their abilities.",
              "Thus, programmers of mainframe games focused on strategy and puzzle-solving mechanics over pure action.",
              "Notable games of the period include the tactical combat game Star Trek (1971) by Mike Mayfield, the hide-and-seek game Hunt the Wumpus (1972) by Gregory Yob, and the strategic war game Empire (1977) by Walter Bright.",
              "Perhaps the most significant game of the period was Colossal Cave Adventure (or simply Adventure), created in 1976 by Will Crowther by combining his passion for caving with concepts from the newly released tabletop role-playing game (RPG) Dungeons & Dragons (D&D).",
              "Expanded by Don Woods in 1977 with an emphasis on the high fantasy of J.",

              "Tolkien, Adventure established a new genre based around exploration and inventory-based puzzle solving that made the transition to personal computers in the late 1970s.",
              "While most games were created on hardware of limited graphic ability, one computer able to host more impressive games was the PLATO system developed at the University of Illinois.",
              "Intended as an educational computer, the system connected hundreds of users all over the United States via remote terminals that featured high-quality plasma displays and allowed users to interact with each other in real time.",
              "This allowed the system to host an impressive array of graphical and/or multiplayer games, including some of the earliest known computer RPGs, which were primarily derived, like Adventure, from D&D, but unlike that game placed a greater emphasis on combat and character progression than puzzle solving.",
              "Starting with top-down dungeon crawls like The Dungeon (1975) and The Game of Dungeons (1975), more commonly referred to today by their filenames, pedit5 and dnd, PLATO RPGs soon transitioned to a first-person perspective with games like Moria (1975), Oubliette (1977), and Avatar (1979), which often allowed multiple players to join forces to battle monsters and complete quests together.",
              "Like Adventure, these games ultimately inspired some of the earliest personal computer games.",
              "The modern video game industry grew out of the concurrent development of the first arcade video game and the first home video game console in the early 1970s in the United States.",
              "The arcade video game industry grew out of the pre-existing arcade game industry, which was previously dominated by electro-mechanical games (EM games).",
              "Following the arrival of Sega's EM game Periscope (1966), the arcade industry was experiencing a \"technological renaissance\" driven by \"audio-visual\" EM novelty games, establishing the arcades as a healthy environment for the introduction of commercial video games in the early 1970s.",
              "[5] In the late 1960s, a college student Nolan Bushnell had a part-time job at an arcade where he became familiar with EM games, watching customers play and helping to maintain the machinery while learning how it worked and developing his understanding of how the game business operates.",
              "[6] In 1966, while working at Sanders Associates, Ralph Baer came up with an idea for an entertainment device that could be hooked up to a television monitor.",
              "Presenting this to his superiors at Sanders and getting their approval, he, along with William Harrison and William Rusch, refined Baer's concept into the \"Brown Box\" prototype of a home video game console that could play a simple table tennis game.",
              "The three patented the technology, and Sanders, not in the commercialization business, sold licenses to the patents to Magnavox to commercialize.",
              "With Baer's help, Magnavox developed the Magnavox Odyssey, the first commercial home console, in 1972.",
              "Concurrently, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney had the idea of making a coin-operated system to run Spacewar!",
              "By 1971, the two had developed Computer Space with Nutting Associates, the first arcade video game.",
              "[7] Bushnell and Dabney struck out on their own and formed Atari.",
              "Bushnell, inspired by the table tennis game on the Odyssey, hired Allan Alcorn to develop an arcade version of the game, this time using discrete transistor\u2013transistor logic (TTL) electronic circuitry.",
              "Atari's Pong was released in late 1972 and is considered the first successful arcade video game.",
              "It ignited the growth of the arcade game industry in the United States from both established coin-operated game manufacturers like Williams, Chicago Coin, and the Midway subsidiary of Bally Manufacturing, and new startups such as Ramtek and Allied Leisure.",
              "Many of these were Pong clones using ball-and-paddle controls, and led to saturation of the market in 1974, forcing arcade game makers to try to innovate new games in 1975.",
              "Many of the newer companies created in the wake of Pong failed to innovate on their own and shut down, and by the end of 1975, the arcade market had fallen by about 50% based on new game sale revenues.",
              "[8] Further, Magnavox took Atari and several other of these arcade game makers to court over violations of Baer's patents.",
              "Bushnell settled the suit for Atari, gaining perpetual rights for the patents for Atari as part of the settlement.",

              "Rather than face a lengthy and undoubtedly unsuccessful court case, Atari settled with Magnavox.",
              "The home version of Pong was just as successful as the arcade version.",
              "Atari sold 150,000 units in 1975 alone (compared to the 200,000 Odysseys that took Magnavox three years to sell.)",

              "This advance allowed users to build a library of games.",
              "There was soon a wide variety of games to choose from, but, ironically, this surplus proved to be the one of the key reasons that the industry faced a serious crash during the early 1980s.",
              "In a classic case of supply outpacing demand, too many games hit the market, and many were of inferior quality.",
              "Further complicating matters, there were too many video game consoles from which to choose.",
              "Beyond the flooded market, video games consoles now faced growing competition from computers.",
              "The bulky, room-sized expensive computer behemoths were a thing of the past.",
              "The age of the home computer had arrived.",
              "For many, purchasing a versatile computer, like the Apple II, Radio Shack\u2019s TRS-80, or the Commodore 64, which could play games in addition to running a multitude of other programs, seemed a more logical investment than buying a system devoted solely to gaming.",
              "Sales of video game consoles and cartridges plunged in 1983 and 1984.",
              "Many companies like Mattel and Magnavox discontinued their video game lines completely, while Atari, the leader in the field, struggled to remain afloat.",
              "Video games remained popular arcade features, but it seemed that the era of home video game systems had ended.",
              "But in 1985, a small Japanese company proved just the opposite.",
              "That year, Nintendo released its Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), whose popularity and commercial success surpassed any previous game console.",

              "The Magnavox Odyssey is the first commercial home video game console.",
              "The hardware was designed by a small team led by Ralph H.",
              "Baer at Sanders Associates, while Magnavox completed development and released it in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year.",
              "The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box that connects to a television set, and two rectangular controllers attached by wires.",
              "It is capable of displaying three square dots and one line of varying height on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing behavior for the dots depending on the game played.",
              "Players place plastic overlays on the screen to display additional visual elements for each game, and one or two players for each game control their dots with the knobs and buttons on the controller by the rules given for the game.",
              "The console cannot generate audio or track scores.",
              "The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia to accompany the games, while a peripheral controller\u2014the first video game light gun\u2014was sold separately.",
              "The idea for a video game console was conceived by Baer in August 1966.",
              "Over the next three years he, along with Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch, created seven successive prototype consoles.",
              "The seventh, known as the Brown Box, was shown to several manufacturers before Magnavox agreed to produce it in January 1971.",
              "After releasing the console through their dealerships, Magnavox sold 69,000 units in its first calendar year and 350,000 by the time the console was discontinued in 1975.",
              "The console spawned the Odyssey series of dedicated consoles as well as the 1978 Magnavox Odyssey 2.",
              "One of the 28 games made for the system, a ping-pong game, was an inspiration for Atari's successful 1972 Pong arcade game, in turn driving sales of the Odyssey.",
              "Patents by Baer and the other developers for the system and the games, including what was termed by a judge as \"the pioneering patent of the video game art\", formed the basis of a series of lawsuits spanning 20 years, earning Sanders and Magnavox over US$100 million.",
              "The release of the Odyssey marked the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles and was an early part of the rise of the commercial video game industry.",
              "The Odyssey consists of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers.",
              "The console connects to the television set through an included switch box, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel on channel three or four, which thereafter became the standard for game consoles.",
              "[1] The controllers, designed to sit on a flat surface, contain one button marked Reset on the top of the controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other.",
              "The reset button resets individual elements depending on the game, such as making a player's dot visible after it is turned off.",
              "The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included;",
              "an optional AC power supply was sold separately.",
              "[2] The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.",
              "[3] Internally, the Odyssey architecture is composed of digital computing parts.",
              "The circuitry is implemented in diode\u2013transistor logic using discrete transistors and diodes.",
              "The games themselves do not use ROM cartridges like later consoles, but instead, use \"game cards\" composed of printed circuit boards that plug into the console.",
              "These cards modify the internal circuitry like a set of switches or jumpers, causing the Odyssey to display different components and react to inputs differently.",
              "Multiple games use the same cards, with different instructions given to the player to change the style of the game.",
              "[4] The Odyssey is capable of displaying three square dots and a vertical line on the screen.",
              "Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself.",
              "The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts the speed of the computer-controlled dot.",
              "Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, such as changing the center line of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game.",
              "The games include plastic overlays that stick to the television via static cling to create visuals.",
              "Games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.",
              "[4] In addition to the overlays, the Odyssey came with dice, poker chips, score sheets, play money, and card decks.",
              "[5] One peripheral controller was released for the Odyssey, the first video game light gun.",
              "Named the Shooting Gallery, the rifle-shaped device registered a hit when pointed at a light source such as a dot on the television screen.",
              "[3] Four shooting-based games were included with the light gun.",
              "[6] In 1951, while working for a military contractor Loral Electronics, engineer Ralph H.",
              "Baer was assigned to build a television set;",
              "Baer later claimed that while doing so he had the idea to build something into a television set that the owner could control in addition to its normal function of receiving signals from a remote television station.",
              "Loral did not pursue the idea, but it returned to Baer in August 1966 while waiting for a bus.",
              "[1] Baer, then the head of the Equipment Design Division at military contractor Sanders Associates, came up with the concept of using a television to play games, and the next morning wrote up a four-page proposal for a \"game box\" that would plug into a television screen, costing around US$25.",
              "[7][8] The proposed device would transmit a signal that the television set could tune into like a television channel, which Baer referred to as Channel LP, short for \"let's play\", and he described several games that could be played on it.",
              "[1][7] While electronic computer games had been developed since the start of the 1950s, they were typically only found in large academic or research institutions, and in 1966 no commercial games or video game industry existed, or any form of video games for consumer television sets.",
              "[7][9] As a \"game box\" had little to do with the typical military contracts Sanders worked on, Baer picked an empty room and assigned one of his technicians, Bob Tremblay, to work on it with him rather than bring the idea to his bosses.",
              "[1][8] By December 1966, they had completed an initial prototype later christened \"TV Game #1\", which could display and move a vertical line on a television screen.",
              "Baer demonstrated the prototype to the Sanders director of research and development, Herbert Campman, who hesitantly agreed to fund it for US$2,000 for labor and US$500 for materials, making it an official project.",
              "[1] Baer spent the next few months designing further prototypes, and in February 1967, assigned technician Bill Harrison to begin building the project.",
              "Harrison spent the next few months in between other projects building out successive modifications to the prototype.",
              "[1] Baer, meanwhile, brainstormed with engineer Bill Rusch on ideas for games for the console, resulting in a proposal for the basis of many games later created for the system.",
              "Harrison began developing some early games in May, beginning with a two-player game where the players repeatedly press a button in competition to fill or empty a bucket of water, and by June multiple games were completed for what was then a second prototype box.",
              "[10] These included a game where players controlled dots chasing each other and a light gun shooter game with a plastic rifle.",
              "Baer demonstrated the new prototype to Campman, who enjoyed the shooting game, increased funding, and recommended Baer demonstrate the project to senior management.",
              "[7][10] Baer demonstrated the console to the board, who were largely uninterested, though a couple of members were enthusiastic;",
              "nevertheless, CEO Royden Sanders authorized the project to be continued with the aim of selling or licensing the console as a commercial product.",
              "[7][8][10] By August 1967, Baer and Harrison completed a more focused prototype machine with fewer components, but found that to even come near to Baer's initial price target of US$25 (equivalent to about $219 in 2022) the console would require so much to be excluded that the resulting product would not be very enjoyable.",
              "Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system;",
              "to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project.",
              "[10] Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming up with a way to display a third, console-controlled spot on the screen in addition to the previous two player-controlled ones, and proposing the development of a ping-pong game.",
              "[7][10] By November, the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping-pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping-pong game.",
              "Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it;",
              "they had decided to sell the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.",
              "[10] The team first approached the cable television industry, and the prototype attracted the attention of TelePrompTer Corporation, who had seen it during a visit.",
              "After a few months of talks, cash-flow problems forced TelePrompter to back out in April 1968.",
              "[7] The same economic downturn that caused TelePrompter's problems caused financial difficulties at Sanders as well, which put the project on hold after the fifth prototype was developed while simultaneously undergoing large-scale layoffs.",
              "It was picked up again in September, this time without Rusch, and went through two more iterations resulting in January 1969 in the seventh prototype, known as the \"Brown Box\" due to the wood-grain stickers on the casing.",
              "[11] With the system now largely complete, as the team began filing for patents they were unsure whom to approach to sell it until a Sanders patent attorney recommended contacting television manufacturers.",
              "Baer demonstrated the system to several companies, who all expressed enthusiasm;",
              "only RCA wanted to purchase the device, however, and an agreement could not be reached.",
              "Soon afterwards, though, RCA executive Bill Enders left RCA for Magnavox and convinced them to look at the console again.",
              "The creators of the Brown Box again demonstrated the device to Magnavox in July 1969;",
              "they received a tepid reaction from most of the executives, but Vice President of Magnavox Console Products Planning Gerry Martin was in favor, and Magnavox agreed to produce the console.",
              "After a long period of negotiations the two companies finally signed an agreement in January 1971.",
              "[12][13] A team from Magnavox led by George Kent turned the prototype console into a final product.",
              "They designed the exterior of the machine and re-engineered some of the internals with consultation from Baer and Harrison;",
              "they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console.",
              "[11] At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations.",
              "[14] The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns, and although integrated circuits were becoming common by 1972 Magnavox did not redesign the circuitry to use them.",
              "[4] The games for the system were designed by Ron Bradford of Bradford/Cout Design and adman Steve Lehner, based largely on the ones developed by Baer, Harrison, and Rusch.",
              "[6] The product planning for the console was initially overseen by Bob Wiles of the color television division, but was turned over to product manager Bob Fritsche as its own category of product in September 1971.",
              "[11] Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey.",
              "[12] The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, to go along with the plastic overlays for the games designed by Bradford that enhanced the primitive visuals.",
              "[6] The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.",
              "95 (equivalent to about $699 in 2022).",
              "[11] Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players.",
              "[12][15] Magnavox performed market surveys and playtests in Los Angeles and Grand Rapids, Michigan, and demonstrated it to dealers in Las Vegas in May 1972.",
              "The console was publicly unveiled at a press event at the Tavern on the Green in New York City on May 22, 1972.",
              "Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, with availability restricted to dealers in 18 metropolitan areas, and demonstrated it for the next few months to Magnavox dealerships and media.",
              "[11] Magnavox began advertising the Odyssey in mid-September 1972, including an appearance on the game show What's My Line?",
              "on October 16, 1972.",
              "As the term \"video game\" was not yet in use, the company described the console as \"the new electronic game of the future\" and \"closed-circuit electronic playground\".",
              "[16][17] Magnavox initially ordered 50,000 units, but before release increased its production capabilities and built a larger inventory, as market testing found an enthusiastic response to the console.",
              "The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers, who handled their own advertising in their local markets;",
              "the company hoped that as the video game console was the first such product, consumers would visit its stores specifically for it.",
              "[6][17] There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972.",
              "Magnavox only sold 69,000 units.",
              "[6][18][19] Baer believed that the low initial sales were due to the high price, and because Magnavox restricted sales to its dealerships and implied that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions.",
              "[6][15][19] Other sources have stated that dealers may have misled customers to sell more televisions, though advertisements and in-store promotional videos explicitly stated that the Odyssey worked with \"any brand TV, black and white or color\".",
              "[17][20] Customers unfamiliar with the new device, seeing it was only sold at Magnavox dealerships, may have misunderstood its interoperability.",
              "[16][17][21] Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry said that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not the production run.",
              "[4] After the initial holiday season Magnavox considered discontinuing the console, but the modest continuing demand, along with high customer satisfaction reports in surveys, convinced it to continue stocking the console.",
              "[22] Magnavox published two catalogs each year, one before the Christmas season and another for its annual sale in January.",
              "The Odyssey did not appear in the pre-Christmas 1972 catalog, but the January 1973 catalog depicted the console in a two-page spread with pictures of bundled and optional games and the light gun.",
              "[17] Fritsche's team proposed the creation of alternate versions of the Odyssey, a \"lite\" version with five games and a version with four controllers and a dozen new or updated games.",
              "Baer proposed an add-on that would add sound to games, and a putting controller and associated golf game.",
              "[22][23] Magnavox rejected the proposals, instead releasing four games for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Emry.",
              "[4][22] Although still only available at Magnavox dealers, national marketing for Odyssey began in late 1973.",
              "[17] The company lowered the price to US$50 if purchased with a television.",
              "[16][17][22] The console was released that year with different games in 12 other countries: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Soviet Union, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela.",
              "[4][24] It was additionally released at some point in other countries, such as Mexico, where it was named the Magnavox Odisea, and clone versions were released by other manufacturers such as the Overkal in Spain, which may be the first console produced in Europe.",
              "[25][26] In late 1973, Magnavox ran a large advertising campaign for its 1974 products, including sponsoring Frank Sinatra's November television special Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back.",
              "[27][28] Commercials during the special and advertisements for it showed the Odyssey and other Magnavox products.",
              "[16][17] Continuing demand led Magnavox to manufacture an additional 27,000 units for the 1973 holiday season, selling 20,000 of them according to Baer.",
              "[18][22] In 1974, Odyssey appeared in the Sears Wish Book.",
              "[17] Magnavox sold 89,000 consoles in total in 1973, 129,000 Odyssey units in 1974, and 80,000 units in 1975.",
              "[18][22] According to Baer the company sold 350,000 Odysseys in total worldwide, though Fritsche stated it reached 367,000.",
              "[18][19][22] The light gun peripheral sold 20,000 units.",
              "[3] Although there was continued customer demand for the console, Magnavox discontinued production of the Odyssey in the fall of 1975.",
              "Rising inflation had raised the manufacturing cost of the system to Magnavox from roughly US$37 to US$47, and Magnavox was unable to raise the retail price to match.",
              "Instead, it sought a cheaper alternative;",
              "in May 1974 it signed a contract with Texas Instruments for integrated circuits to replace the transistors and diodes of the original system, and designed a limited version of the console around them.",
              "[22] The result was the first of several dedicated consoles\u2014consoles that could only play games built into the system\u2014in the Magnavox Odyssey series, the Magnavox Odyssey 100 and Magnavox Odyssey 200, as part of the first generation of video game consoles;",
              "the Odyssey 100 was only capable of playing the ping-pong and hockey games from the original Odyssey, while the 200 also had the handball game and a rudimentary on-screen scoring system.",
              "[21][22] The 100 and 200 were released in November 1975 to replace the Odyssey for US$69.",
              "95 and US$109.",
              "95, respectively.",
              "[22] Eleven dedicated Odyssey consoles were produced before a follow-up non-dedicated console in 1978, the Magnavox Odyssey 2.",

              "[12] Inspired, when he and Ted Dabney quit Nutting to found Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping-pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game.",
              "Alcorn soon developed Pong (1972), which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game.",

              "[34] Baer later stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits.",
              "[23] The root of the conflict was a set of patents by Baer and the development team\u2014particularly a pair which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, with one patent by Baer and one by Rusch.",
              "[33][35] The judge, John Grady, ruled in early 1977 that Baer's patent for the Odyssey constituted \"the pioneering patent of the video game art\", held the defendants' games as infringing, and set a precedent that any video game where a machine-controlled visual element hit and bounced off a player-controlled element violated Rusch's patent.",

              "nevertheless, CEO Royden Sanders authorized the project to be continued with the aim of selling or licensing the console as a commercial product.",
              "[7][8][10] By August 1967, Baer and Harrison completed a more focused prototype machine with fewer components, but found that to even come near to Baer's initial price target of US$25 (equivalent to about $219 in 2022) the console would require so much to be excluded that the resulting product would not be very enjoyable.",
              "Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system;",
              "to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project.",
              "[10] Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming up with a way to display a third, console-controlled spot on the screen in addition to the previous two player-controlled ones, and proposing the development of a ping-pong game.",
              "[7][10] By November, the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping-pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping-pong game.",
              "Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it;",
              "they had decided to sell the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.",
              "[10] The team first approached the cable television industry, and the prototype attracted the attention of TelePrompTer Corporation, who had seen it during a visit.",
              "After a few months of talks, cash-flow problems forced TelePrompter to back out in April 1968.",
              "[7] The same economic downturn that caused TelePrompter's problems caused financial difficulties at Sanders as well, which put the project on hold after the fifth prototype was developed while simultaneously undergoing large-scale layoffs.",
              "It was picked up again in September, this time without Rusch, and went through two more iterations resulting in January 1969 in the seventh prototype, known as the \"Brown Box\" due to the wood-grain stickers on the casing.",
              "[11] With the system now largely complete, as the team began filing for patents they were unsure whom to approach to sell it until a Sanders patent attorney recommended contacting television manufacturers.",
              "Baer demonstrated the system to several companies, who all expressed enthusiasm;",
              "only RCA wanted to purchase the device, however, and an agreement could not be reached.",
              "Soon afterwards, though, RCA executive Bill Enders left RCA for Magnavox and convinced them to look at the console again.",
              "The creators of the Brown Box again demonstrated the device to Magnavox in July 1969;",
              "they received a tepid reaction from most of the executives, but Vice President of Magnavox Console Products Planning Gerry Martin was in favor, and Magnavox agreed to produce the console.",
              "After a long period of negotiations the two companies finally signed an agreement in January 1971.",
              "[12][13] A team from Magnavox led by George Kent turned the prototype console into a final product.",
              "They designed the exterior of the machine and re-engineered some of the internals with consultation from Baer and Harrison;",
              "they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console.",
              "[11] At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations.",
              "[14] The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns, and although integrated circuits were becoming common by 1972 Magnavox did not redesign the circuitry to use them.",
              "[4] The games for the system were designed by Ron Bradford of Bradford/Cout Design and adman Steve Lehner, based largely on the ones developed by Baer, Harrison, and Rusch.",
              "[6] The product planning for the console was initially overseen by Bob Wiles of the color television division, but was turned over to product manager Bob Fritsche as its own category of product in September 1971.",
              "[11] Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey.",
              "[12] The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, to go along with the plastic overlays for the games designed by Bradford that enhanced the primitive visuals.",
              "[6] The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.",
              "95 (equivalent to about $699 in 2022).",
              "[11] Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players.",
              "[12][15] Magnavox performed market surveys and playtests in Los Angeles and Grand Rapids, Michigan, and demonstrated it to dealers in Las Vegas in May 1972.",
              "The console was publicly unveiled at a press event at the Tavern on the Green in New York City on May 22, 1972.",
              "Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, with availability restricted to dealers in 18 metropolitan areas, and demonstrated it for the next few months to Magnavox dealerships and media.",
              "[11] Magnavox began advertising the Odyssey in mid-September 1972, including an appearance on the game show What's My Line?",
              "on October 16, 1972.",
              "As the term \"video game\" was not yet in use, the company described the console as \"the new electronic game of the future\" and \"closed-circuit electronic playground\".",
              "[16][17] Magnavox initially ordered 50,000 units, but before release increased its production capabilities and built a larger inventory, as market testing found an enthusiastic response to the console.",
              "The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers, who handled their own advertising in their local markets;",
              "the company hoped that as the video game console was the first such product, consumers would visit its stores specifically for it.",
              "[6][17] There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972.",
              "Magnavox only sold 69,000 units.",
              "[6][18][19] Baer believed that the low initial sales were due to the high price, and because Magnavox restricted sales to its dealerships and implied that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions.",
              "[6][15][19] Other sources have stated that dealers may have misled customers to sell more televisions, though advertisements and in-store promotional videos explicitly stated that the Odyssey worked with \"any brand TV, black and white or color\".",
              "[17][20] Customers unfamiliar with the new device, seeing it was only sold at Magnavox dealerships, may have misunderstood its interoperability.",
              "[16][17][21] Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry said that the sales were in line with the original projections, if not the production run.",
              "[4] After the initial holiday season Magnavox considered discontinuing the console, but the modest continuing demand, along with high customer satisfaction reports in surveys, convinced it to continue stocking the console.",
              "[22] Magnavox published two catalogs each year, one before the Christmas season and another for its annual sale in January.",
              "The Odyssey did not appear in the pre-Christmas 1972 catalog, but the January 1973 catalog depicted the console in a two-page spread with pictures of bundled and optional games and the light gun.",
              "[17] Fritsche's team proposed the creation of alternate versions of the Odyssey, a \"lite\" version with five games and a version with four controllers and a dozen new or updated games.",
              "Baer proposed an add-on that would add sound to games, and a putting controller and associated golf game.",
              "[22][23] Magnavox rejected the proposals, instead releasing four games for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Emry.",
              "[4][22] Although still only available at Magnavox dealers, national marketing for Odyssey began in late 1973.",
              "[17] The company lowered the price to US$50 if purchased with a television.",
              "[16][17][22] The console was released that year with different games in 12 other countries: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Soviet Union, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela.",
              "[4][24] It was additionally released at some point in other countries, such as Mexico, where it was named the Magnavox Odisea, and clone versions were released by other manufacturers such as the Overkal in Spain, which may be the first console produced in Europe.",
              "[25][26] In late 1973, Magnavox ran a large advertising campaign for its 1974 products, including sponsoring Frank Sinatra's November television special Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back.",
              "[27][28] Commercials during the special and advertisements for it showed the Odyssey and other Magnavox products.",
              "[16][17] Continuing demand led Magnavox to manufacture an additional 27,000 units for the 1973 holiday season, selling 20,000 of them according to Baer.",
              "[18][22] In 1974, Odyssey appeared in the Sears Wish Book.",
              "[17] Magnavox sold 89,000 consoles in total in 1973, 129,000 Odyssey units in 1974, and 80,000 units in 1975.",
              "[18][22] According to Baer the company sold 350,000 Odysseys in total worldwide, though Fritsche stated it reached 367,000.",
              "[18][19][22] The light gun peripheral sold 20,000 units.",
              "[3] Although there was continued customer demand for the console, Magnavox discontinued production of the Odyssey in the fall of 1975.",
              "Rising inflation had raised the manufacturing cost of the system to Magnavox from roughly US$37 to US$47, and Magnavox was unable to raise the retail price to match.",
              "Instead, it sought a cheaper alternative;",
              "in May 1974 it signed a contract with Texas Instruments for integrated circuits to replace the transistors and diodes of the original system, and designed a limited version of the console around them.",
              "[22] The result was the first of several dedicated consoles\u2014consoles that could only play games built into the system\u2014in the Magnavox Odyssey series, the Magnavox Odyssey 100 and Magnavox Odyssey 200, as part of the first generation of video game consoles;",
              "the Odyssey 100 was only capable of playing the ping-pong and hockey games from the original Odyssey, while the 200 also had the handball game and a rudimentary on-screen scoring system.",
              "[21][22] The 100 and 200 were released in November 1975 to replace the Odyssey for US$69.",
              "95 and US$109.",
              "95, respectively.",
              "[22] Eleven dedicated Odyssey consoles were produced before a follow-up non-dedicated console in 1978, the Magnavox Odyssey 2.",
              "[4] While it showed the potential of video game consoles and was an early part of the rise of the commercial video game industry, the Odyssey is not generally considered a major commercial success.",
              "Magnavox produced no more games for the console after 1973 and rejected proposals for different versions of the console or accessories.",
              "[4][23] While a few clone systems were produced in limited quantities, and multiple dedicated systems\u2014generally focused on ping-pong game variants\u2014were created by several companies, no other home video consoles capable of playing separately-produced games were released until the 1976 Fairchild Semiconductor Channel F.",
              "[4] Due to his work on the Odyssey, Baer has been referred to as the \"Father of Video Games\".",
              "[29] In 2004, Baer was awarded the National Medal of Technology for \"his groundbreaking and pioneering creation, development and commercialization of interactive video games, which spawned related uses, applications, and mega-industries in both the entertainment and education realms\".",
              "[30] The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) added the Magnavox Odyssey to its permanent collection of video games in 2013.",
              "MoMA's Paul Galloway described the console as \"a masterpiece of engineering and industrial design\" and stated that it was \"hard to overstate the importance of [Ralph Baer's] place in the birth of the industry\".",
              "[31] The Brown Box prototype and the TV Game #1 prototype are located in Washington, D.",
              "C.",
              "at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.",
              "[32] In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief engineer Nolan Bushnell, designer of the first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw a demonstration of the Odyssey.",
              "[12] Inspired, when he and Ted Dabney quit Nutting to found Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping-pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game.",
              "Alcorn soon developed Pong (1972), which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game.",
              "Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey;",
              "Baer noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card.",
              "In April 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors, including Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and arcade distributor Empire, for infringing on its patents for video games played on a television screen.",
              "[12][34] Two more lawsuits joined it by 1975, against Sears, Nutting, Williams Electronics, and others.",
              "[34] Baer later stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits.",
              "[23] The root of the conflict was a set of patents by Baer and the development team\u2014particularly a pair which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, with one patent by Baer and one by Rusch.",
              "[33][35] The judge, John Grady, ruled in early 1977 that Baer's patent for the Odyssey constituted \"the pioneering patent of the video game art\", held the defendants' games as infringing, and set a precedent that any video game where a machine-controlled visual element hit and bounced off a player-controlled element violated Rusch's patent.",
              "At the time of judgement, only Seeburg Corporation and Chicago Dynamic Industries\u2014though bankrupt\u2014remained out of the defendants of the initial three lawsuits, with all other companies having settled out of court.",
              "[34] Atari's settlement, made in June 1976, granted it a license in exchange for US$1.",
              "5 million and access granted to Magnavox to all technology produced by Atari from June 1976 to June 1977;",
              "other defendants paid higher penalties.",
              "[12][18][36] Over the next twenty years, Sanders and Magnavox sued several other companies over the issue, focusing on \"paddle-and-ball\" type games like Pong and Table Tennis that more clearly violated the patent;",
              "the final lawsuits ended in the mid-1990s.",
              "[8][23] Defendants included Coleco, Mattel, Seeburg, and Activision;",
              "Sanders and Magnavox won or settled every lawsuit.",
              "[8][37][38] Many of the defendants unsuccessfully attempted to claim that the patents only applied to the specific hardware implementations that Baer had used, or that they were invalidated by prior computer or electronic games.",
              "[39] In 1985, Nintendo sued and tried to invalidate the patents, claiming as prior art the 1958 Tennis for Two game built by William Higinbotham.",
              "The court, however, ruled that the oscilloscope-based game did not use video signals and therefore did not qualify as a video game, and ruled again in favor of Magnavox and Sanders.",
              "[3] Magnavox won more than US$100 million in the various lawsuits and settlements involving the Odyssey related patents before they expired in the early 1990s.",
              "[40] A total of 28 games distributed on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey.",

              "Some simply copied the \"invading alien hordes\" idea of Space Invaders and turned out successful imitators like Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which extended the fixed shooter genre with new gameplay mechanics, more complex enemy patterns, and richer graphics.",
              "[81][82] Galaxian introduced a \"risk-reward\" concept,[83] while Galaga was one of the first games with a bonus stage.",
              "[84] Sega's 1980 release Space Tactics was an early first-person space combat game with multi-directional scrolling as the player moved the cross-hairs on the screen.",
              "[85] Others tried new concepts and defined new genres.",
              "Rapidly evolving hardware allowed new kinds of games which allowed for different styles of gameplay.",
              "The term \"action games\" began being used in the early 1980s, in reference to a new genre of character action games that emerged from Japanese arcade developers, drawing inspiration from manga and anime culture.",
              "According to Eugene Jarvis, these new character-driven Japanese action games emphasized \"character development, hand-drawn animation and backgrounds, and a more deterministic, scripted, pattern-type\" of play.",
              "Terms such as \"action games\" or \"character games\" began being used to distinguish these new character-driven action games from the space shooters that had previously dominated the video game industry.",
              "[86][87][88] The emphasis on character-driven gameplay in turn enabled a wider variety of subgenres.",
              "[87] In 1980, Namco released Pac-Man, which popularized the maze chase genre, and Rally-X, which featured a radar tracking the player position on the map.",
              "[58] Games such as the pioneering 1981 games Donkey Kong and Qix in 1981 introduced new types of games where skill and timing are more important than shooting as fast as possible, with Nintendo's Donkey Kong in particular setting the template for the platform game genre.",
              "[89] The two most popular genres during the golden age were space shooters and character action games.",
              "[86] While Japanese developers were creating a character-driven action game genre in the early 1980s, American developers largely adopted a different approach to game design at the time.",
              "[86] According to Eugene Jarvis, American arcade developers focused mainly on space shooters during the late 1970s to early 1980s, greatly influenced by Japanese space shooters but taking the genre in a different direction from the \"more deterministic, scripted, pattern-type\" gameplay of Japanese games, towards a more \"programmer-centric design culture, emphasizing algorithmic generation of backgrounds and enemy dispatch\" and \"an emphasis on random-event generation, particle-effect explosions and physics\" as seen in arcade games such as his own Defender (1981)[86] and Robotron: 2084 (1982)[90] as well as Atari's Asteroids (1979).",
              "[91] Namco's Bosconian in 1981 introduced a free-roaming style of gameplay where the player's ship freely moves across open space, while also including a radar tracking player & enemy positions.",
              "[92] Bega's Battle in 1983 introduced a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video cutscenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages.",
              "[61] Other examples of innovative games are Atari Games' Paperboy in 1984 where the goal is to successfully deliver newspapers to customers, and Namco's Phozon where the object is to duplicate a shape shown in the middle of the screen.",
              "The theme of Exidy's Venture is dungeon exploration and treasure-gathering.",
              "Q*bert plays upon the user's sense of depth perception to deliver a novel experience.",
              "Some games of this era were so popular that they entered popular culture.",
              "The first to do so was Space Invaders.",
              "The game was so popular upon its release in 1978 that an urban legend blamed it for a national shortage of 100 yen coins in Japan, leading to a production increase of coins to meet demand for the game[93][94] (although 100 yen coin production was lower in 1978 and 1979 than in previous or subsequent years,[95][96] and the claim does not withstand logical scrutiny: arcade operators would have emptied out their machines and taken the money to the bank, thus keeping the coins in circulation).",
              "[96] It soon had a similar impact in North America, where it has appeared or is referenced in numerous facets of popular culture.",
              "Soon after the release of Space Invaders, hundreds of favourable articles and stories about the emerging video game medium aired on television and were printed in newspapers and magazines.",
              "The Space Invaders Tournament held by Atari in 1980 was the first video game competition and attracted more than 10,000 participants, establishing video gaming as a mainstream hobby.",
              "[97] By 1980, 86% of the 13\u201320 population in the United States had played arcade video games,[98] and by 1981, there were more than 35 million gamers visiting video game arcades in the United States.",
              "[99] The game that most affected popular culture in North America was Pac-Man.",
              "Its release in 1980 caused such a sensation that it initiated what is now referred to as \"Pac-Mania\" (which later became the title of the last coin-operated game in the series, released in 1987).",
              "Released by Namco, the game featured a yellow, circle-shaped creature trying to eat dots through a maze while avoiding pursuing enemies.",
              "Though no one could agree what the \"hero\" or enemies represented (they were variously referred to as ghosts, goblins or monsters), the game was extremely popular.",
              "The game spawned an animated television series, numerous clones, Pac-Man-branded foods, toys, and a hit pop song, \"Pac-Man Fever\".",
              "The game's popularity was such that President Ronald Reagan congratulated a player for setting a record score in Pac-Man.",
              "[100] Pac-Man was also responsible for expanding the arcade game market to involve large numbers of female audiences across all age groups.",
              "[101] Though many popular games quickly entered the lexicon of popular culture, most have since left, and Pac-Man is unusual in remaining a recognized term in popular culture, along with Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Mario and Q*bert.",
              "Seen as an additional source of revenue, arcade games began popping up outside of dedicated arcades, including bars, restaurants, movie theaters, bowling alleys, convenience stores, laundromats, gas stations, supermarkets, airports, even dentist and doctor offices.",

              "[4] Pac-Man sold about 400,000 cabinets overall by 1982.",
              "[18] Donkey Kong was also significant as not only being the first recognized platform game but also bringing a cute, more fantastical concept that was well-founded in Japanese culture but new to Western regions, compared to prior arcade games.",
              "Western audiences became accustomed to this level of abstraction, making later Japanese-made arcade games and titles for the Nintendo Entertainment System easily accepted by these players.",

              "Knowing that players were seeking more challenge, game manufacturers designed the newer games to be harder, but this caused less-skilled mainstream players to be turned away.",

              "Many cities and towns implemented bans on arcades or limiting businesses to only a few machines by the mid-1980s.",
              "[4][20] Several of these bans were challenges by arcade owners on First Amendment challenges, asserting video games merits protection as an art form, but the bulk of these cases ruled against arcades, favoring local regulations that were limiting conduct rather than restricting speech.",
              "[27] Further impacting the arcades, the rising popularity of home consoles threatened the arcades, since players did not have to repeatedly spend money to play at arcades when they could play at home.",
              "But with the 1983 video game crash which drastically affected the home console market, the arcade market also felt its impact as it was already waning from oversaturation, loss of players, and the moral concerns over video games, all stressed by the early 1980s recession.",

              "[20] The US arcade video game market experienced another decline from 1989.",
              "[31][38] RePlay magazine partly attributed the decline to the rise of home consoles following the success of the NES.",
              "[39] In Japan, on the other hand, the arcade market grew while home video game sales declined.",
              "[40] Overall, the worldwide arcade market continued to grow, remaining larger than the console market.",

              "[41][42] Hang-On also used a motion-controlled arcade cabinet that included a mounted motorbike-like control unit on a hydraulic system, which the player used to control the game by tilting their body to the left or right, two decades before motion controls became popular on consoles.",
              "This game began the \"taikan\" (\"body sensation\") trend, the use of motion simulator arcade cabinets in many arcade games of the late 1980s, such as Sega's Space Harrier (1985), Out Run (1986) and After Burner (1987).",
              "[43] SNK also launched its Neo Geo line in 1990 to try to bridge the arcade and home console gap.",
              "The launch consisted of the Neo Geo Multi Video System (MVS) arcade system and the Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System (AES).",
              "Both units shared the same game cartridges, with the MVS able to support up to six different games at the same time selectable by the player.",

              "[44] Arcade systems dedicated to flat-shaded 3D polygon graphics also began emerging, with the Namco System 21 used for Winning Run (1988) and the related Atari Games hardware for Hard Drivin' (1989),[45] as well as the Taito Air System used for amateur flight simulations such as Top Landing (1988) and Air Inferno (1990).",

              "Besides the other avenues of technical advances, the hardware for arcade machines had shrunk small enough that the core electronics could be fitted into cocktail-style cabinets or half-height bartop or countertop versions, making them ideal for placement in more adult venues.",
              "Coupled with waning interest in traditional arcade games due to the 1983 video game crash and the rising popularity of the board game Trivial Pursuit first introduced in 1981, several manufacturers turned to quiz style games to be sold to bars in these smaller formats, including more risque titles.",
              "Manufacturers also saw similar opportunities to promote these games for family-oriented entertainment and potential use as educational tools.",
              "The rush of arcade-based trivia games waned around 1986 as the general interest in trivia waned, but arcades and other entertainment businesses managed to find ways to keep trivia-style games going within arcades since, often based on multiplayer trivia challenges played out on multiple screens.",
              "These trivia games also influenced the creation of trivia games on consoles and computers such as the You Don't Know Jack series of games and Trivia HQ.",
              "[48] Arcade games gained a resurgence with the introduction of Street Fighter II by Capcom in 1991.",
              "The original Street Fighter in 1987 had already introduced a fighting game game format that allowed two players to challenge each other, but the characters were generic combatants.",
              "Street Fighter II introduced modern elements to the genre and created the fundamental one-on-one fighting game template, featuring numerous characters with backgrounds and personalities to select from and a wide range of special moves to use.",
              "[4] Street Fighter II sold more than 200,000 cabinets worldwide,[49] and drew other arcade manufacturers to make similar fighting games,[4] including Mortal Kombat in 1992, Virtua Fighter in 1993, and Tekken in 1994.",
              "[4] The period was referred to as a \"boom\"[50] or \"renaissance\" for the arcade industry,[4][51] with the success of Street Fighter II drawing comparisons to that of arcade golden age blockbusters Space Invaders and Pac-Man.",

              "[53] Worldwide arcade video game revenue also maintained its lead over consoles.",
              "[1] In 1993, Electronic Games noted that when \"historians look back at the world of coin-op during the early 1990s, one of the defining highlights of the video game art form will undoubtedly focus on fighting/martial arts themes\" which it described as \"the backbone of the industry\" at the time.",
              "[54] Mortal Kombat, however, led to further controversy over violence in video games due to its gruesome-looking finishing moves.",

              "While arcade systems such as the Sega Model 3 remained considerably more advanced than home systems in the late 1990s,[2][3] the technological advantage that arcade games had, in their ability to customize and use the latest graphics and sound chips, slowly began narrowing, and the convenience of home games eventually caused a decline in arcade gaming.",
              "Sega's sixth generation console, the Dreamcast, could produce 3D graphics comparable to the Sega NAOMI arcade system in 1998, after which Sega produced more powerful arcade systems such as the Sega NAOMI Multiboard and Sega Hikaru in 1999 and the Sega NAOMI 2 in 2000, before Sega eventually stopped manufacturing expensive proprietary arcade system boards, with their subsequent arcade boards being based on more affordable commercial console or PC components.",

              "[1] In 1997, Konami began releasing a number of music-based games that used unique peripherals to control the game in time to music, including Beatmania and GuitarFreaks, culminating in the 1998 release of Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) in Japan, a new style of arcade game that used a dance pad and required players to tap their feet on appropriate squares on the pad in time to notes on screen in synchronization to popular music.",
              "DDR later released in the West in 1999, and while it did not enjoy the same popularity in Japan initially, it led the trend of rhythm games in arcades.",

              "[74] Space Invaders (1978) established the \"multiple life, progressively difficult level paradigm\" used by many classic arcade games.",
              "[75] Designed by Tomohiro Nishikado at Taito, he drew inspiration from Atari's block-breaker game Breakout (1976) and several science fiction works.",
              "Nishikado added several interactive elements to Space Invaders that he found lacking in earlier video games, such as the ability for enemies to react to the player's movement and fire back, with a game over triggered by enemies killing the player (either by getting hit or enemies reaching the bottom of the screen) rather than a timer running out.",
              "[76] In contrast to earlier arcade games which often had a timer, Space Invaders introduced the \"concept of going round after round.\"",
              "[77] It also gave the player multiple lives before the game ends,[78] and saved the high score.",
              "[79] It also had a basic story with animated characters along with a \"crescendo of action and climax\" which laid the groundwork for later video games, according to Eugene Jarvis.",
              "[80] With the enormous success of Space Invaders, dozens of developers jumped into the development and manufacturing of arcade video games.",
              "Some simply copied the \"invading alien hordes\" idea of Space Invaders and turned out successful imitators like Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which extended the fixed shooter genre with new gameplay mechanics, more complex enemy patterns, and richer graphics.",
              "[81][82] Galaxian introduced a \"risk-reward\" concept,[83] while Galaga was one of the first games with a bonus stage.",
              "[84] Sega's 1980 release Space Tactics was an early first-person space combat game with multi-directional scrolling as the player moved the cross-hairs on the screen.",
              "[85] Others tried new concepts and defined new genres.",
              "Rapidly evolving hardware allowed new kinds of games which allowed for different styles of gameplay.",
              "The term \"action games\" began being used in the early 1980s, in reference to a new genre of character action games that emerged from Japanese arcade developers, drawing inspiration from manga and anime culture.",
              "According to Eugene Jarvis, these new character-driven Japanese action games emphasized \"character development, hand-drawn animation and backgrounds, and a more deterministic, scripted, pattern-type\" of play.",
              "Terms such as \"action games\" or \"character games\" began being used to distinguish these new character-driven action games from the space shooters that had previously dominated the video game industry.",
              "[86][87][88] The emphasis on character-driven gameplay in turn enabled a wider variety of subgenres.",
              "[87] In 1980, Namco released Pac-Man, which popularized the maze chase genre, and Rally-X, which featured a radar tracking the player position on the map.",
              "[58] Games such as the pioneering 1981 games Donkey Kong and Qix in 1981 introduced new types of games where skill and timing are more important than shooting as fast as possible, with Nintendo's Donkey Kong in particular setting the template for the platform game genre.",
              "[89] The two most popular genres during the golden age were space shooters and character action games.",
              "[86] While Japanese developers were creating a character-driven action game genre in the early 1980s, American developers largely adopted a different approach to game design at the time.",
              "[86] According to Eugene Jarvis, American arcade developers focused mainly on space shooters during the late 1970s to early 1980s, greatly influenced by Japanese space shooters but taking the genre in a different direction from the \"more deterministic, scripted, pattern-type\" gameplay of Japanese games, towards a more \"programmer-centric design culture, emphasizing algorithmic generation of backgrounds and enemy dispatch\" and \"an emphasis on random-event generation, particle-effect explosions and physics\" as seen in arcade games such as his own Defender (1981)[86] and Robotron: 2084 (1982)[90] as well as Atari's Asteroids (1979).",
              "[91] Namco's Bosconian in 1981 introduced a free-roaming style of gameplay where the player's ship freely moves across open space, while also including a radar tracking player & enemy positions.",
              "[92] Bega's Battle in 1983 introduced a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video cutscenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages.",
              "[61] Other examples of innovative games are Atari Games' Paperboy in 1984 where the goal is to successfully deliver newspapers to customers, and Namco's Phozon where the object is to duplicate a shape shown in the middle of the screen.",
              "The theme of Exidy's Venture is dungeon exploration and treasure-gathering.",
              "Q*bert plays upon the user's sense of depth perception to deliver a novel experience.",
              "Some games of this era were so popular that they entered popular culture.",
              "The first to do so was Space Invaders.",
              "The game was so popular upon its release in 1978 that an urban legend blamed it for a national shortage of 100 yen coins in Japan, leading to a production increase of coins to meet demand for the game[93][94] (although 100 yen coin production was lower in 1978 and 1979 than in previous or subsequent years,[95][96] and the claim does not withstand logical scrutiny: arcade operators would have emptied out their machines and taken the money to the bank, thus keeping the coins in circulation).",
              "[96] It soon had a similar impact in North America, where it has appeared or is referenced in numerous facets of popular culture.",
              "Soon after the release of Space Invaders, hundreds of favourable articles and stories about the emerging video game medium aired on television and were printed in newspapers and magazines.",
              "The Space Invaders Tournament held by Atari in 1980 was the first video game competition and attracted more than 10,000 participants, establishing video gaming as a mainstream hobby.",
              "[97] By 1980, 86% of the 13\u201320 population in the United States had played arcade video games,[98] and by 1981, there were more than 35 million gamers visiting video game arcades in the United States.",
              "[99] The game that most affected popular culture in North America was Pac-Man.",
              "Its release in 1980 caused such a sensation that it initiated what is now referred to as \"Pac-Mania\" (which later became the title of the last coin-operated game in the series, released in 1987).",
              "Released by Namco, the game featured a yellow, circle-shaped creature trying to eat dots through a maze while avoiding pursuing enemies.",
              "Though no one could agree what the \"hero\" or enemies represented (they were variously referred to as ghosts, goblins or monsters), the game was extremely popular.",
              "The game spawned an animated television series, numerous clones, Pac-Man-branded foods, toys, and a hit pop song, \"Pac-Man Fever\".",
              "The game's popularity was such that President Ronald Reagan congratulated a player for setting a record score in Pac-Man.",
              "[100] Pac-Man was also responsible for expanding the arcade game market to involve large numbers of female audiences across all age groups.",
              "[101] Though many popular games quickly entered the lexicon of popular culture, most have since left, and Pac-Man is unusual in remaining a recognized term in popular culture, along with Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Mario and Q*bert.",
              "Seen as an additional source of revenue, arcade games began popping up outside of dedicated arcades, including bars, restaurants, movie theaters, bowling alleys, convenience stores, laundromats, gas stations, supermarkets, airports, even dentist and doctor offices.",

              "In 1982, the game show Starcade premiered.",
              "The program focused on players competing to achieve high scores on the latest arcade titles, with the chance to win the grand prize of their own arcade machine if they could hit a target score within a specific time frame.",

              "[104] In turn, YMO had a major influence on much of the video game music produced during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras.",
              "[105] Other pop songs based on Space Invaders soon followed, including \"Disco Space Invaders\" (1979) by Funny Stuff,[103] \"Space Invaders\" (1980) by Player One (known as Playback in the US),[106] and the hit songs \"Space Invader\" (1980) by The Pretenders[103] and \"Space Invaders\" (1980) by Uncle Vic.",
              "[107] The game was also the basis for Player One's \"Space Invaders\" (1979), which in turn provided the baseline for Jesse Saunders's \"On and On\" (1984),[108][109] the first Chicago house music track.",

              "[10] Other technology such as screen resolution, color graphics, audio, and AI simulation was also improved during this era.",
              "The generation also saw the first handheld game cartridge system, the Microvision, which was released by toy company Milton Bradley in 1979.",
              "In 1979, gaming giant Activision was created by former Atari programmers[11] and was the first third-party developer of video games.",
              "[12] By 1982, the shelf capacity of toy stores was overflowing with an overabundance of consoles, over-hyped game releases, and low-quality games from new third-party developers.",
              "An over-saturation of consoles and games,[13] coupled with poor knowledge of the market, saw the video game industry crash in 1983 and marked the start of the next generation.",
              "Beginning in December 1982 and stretching through all of 1984, the crash of 1983 caused major disruption to the North American market.",
              "[14][15] Some developers collapsed and almost no new games were released in 1984.",
              "The market did not fully recover until the third generation.",
              "[4] The second generation ended on January 1, 1992, with the discontinuation of the Atari 2600.",
              "[16] The primary driver of the second generation of consoles was the introduction of the low-cost microprocessor.",
              "Arcade games and the first generation of consoles used discrete electrical and electro-mechanical components including simple logic chips such as transistor-transistor logic (TTL)-based integrated circuits (ICs).",
              "Custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) like the AY-3-8500 were produced to replicate these circuits within a single chip, but still presented only a single fixed logic program,.",
              "Once a game was shipped, there were only minimal variations that could be made by adjusting the positions of jumpers (effectively the behavior of the \"cartridges\" that shipped with the Magnavox Odyssey).",
              "As Atari, Inc.",
              "recognized, spending from $100,000 to 250,000 and several months of development time on a hardware unit with a single dedicated game with only three-month shelf life before it was outdated by other competitors' offerings was not a practical business model, and instead some type of programmable console would be preferred.",
              "[17] Intel introduced the first microprocessor, the 4004, in 1971, a special computer chip that could be sent a simple instruction and provide its result.",
              "This allowed the ability to create software programs around the microprocessor rather than fix the logic into circuits and ICs.",
              "Engineers at both Atari, Inc.",
              "(via its Cyan Engineering subsidiary) and at Alpex Computer Corporation saw the potential to apply this to home consoles as prices for microprocessors became more affordable.",
              "Alpex's work led to partnership with semiconductor manufacturer Fairchild Camera and Instrument and lead to the release of the first such programmable home console, the Fairchild Channel F released in 1976, based on the Fairchild F8 microprocessor.",
              "The Channel F also established the use of ROM cartridges to provide the software for the programmable console, consisting of a ROM chip mounted on a circuit board within a hard casing that can withstand the physical insertion into the console and potential static electricity buildup.",
              "[18] Atari's own programmable console, the Atari Video Computer System (Atari VCS or later known as the Atari 2600), was released in 1977 and based on the MOS Technology 6507 microprocessor, with a cartridge design influenced in part by the Channel F system.",
              "[18] Other console manufacturers soon followed suit with the production of their own programmable consoles.",
              "At the start of the second generation, all games were developed and produced in-house.",
              "Four former Atari programmers, having left from conflicts in management style after Atari was purchased by Warner Communications in 1976, established Activision in 1979 to develop their own VCS games, which included Kaboom!",
              "and Pitfall!",
              ".",
              "Atari sued Activision on the basis of theft of trade secrets and violation of their non-disclosure agreements, but the two companies settled out of court in 1982, with Activision agreeing to pay a small license fee to Atari for every game of theirs they sold.",
              "This established Activision as the first third-party developer for a console.",
              "This also established a working model for licensing other third-party developers, which several companies followed in Activision's wake, partially contributing to the video game crash of 1983 due to oversaturation.",
              "[19] As the second generation of consoles coincided with the golden age of arcade video games, a common trend that emerged during the generation was licensing arcade video games for consoles.",
              "Many of them were increasingly licensed from Japanese video game companies by 1980, which led to Jonathan Greenberg of Forbes predicting in early 1981 that Japanese companies would eventually dominate the North American video game industry later in the decade.",
              "[20] At this stage, both consoles and game cartridges were intended to be sold for profit by manufacturers.",
              "However, by segregating games from the console, this approach established the use of the razorblade business model in future console generations, where consoles would be sold at or below cost while licensing fees from third-party games would bring in profits.",
              "[21][22] The Fairchild Channel F, also known early in its life as the Fairchild Video Entertainment System (VES), was released by Fairchild Semiconductor in November 1976 and was the first console of the second generation.",
              "[23] It was the world's first CPU-based video game console, introducing the cartridge-based game-code storage format.",
              "[24] The console featured a pause button that allowed players to freeze a game.",
              "This allowed them to take a break without the need to reset or turn off the console so they did not lose their current game progress.",
              "[25] Fairchild released twenty-six cartridges for the system, with up to four games being on each cartridge.",
              "The console came with two pre-installed games, Hockey and Tennis.",
              "[26] Following the release of the Atari 2600, the Channel F's popularity waned quickly as the more action-driven games of the Atari 2600 drew more attention than the more educational and slow-paced games on the Channel F.",
              "By 1979, only an additional 100,000 units of the Channel F were sold for lifetime sales of 350,000.",
              "[27] In 1978, Fairchild redesigned the system into a new model, the Channel F System II.",
              "The System II streamlined some of the initial Channel F to reduce cost and improve consumer usage compared to the Atari 2600, such as improved controller connections and using the television speakers for audio output, but by the time it was released, the Atari 2600 has too much market advantage for Fairchild to overcome.",
              "After releasing only six games for the system, Fairchild sold the Channel F technology to Zircon International in 1979, which discontinued the system by 1983.",
              "[27] In 1977, Atari released its CPU-based console called the Video Computer System (VCS), later called the Atari 2600.",
              "[28] Nine games were designed and released for the holiday season.",
              "Atari held exclusive rights to most of the popular arcade game conversions of the day.",
              "They used this key segment to support their older hardware in the market.",
              "This game advantage and the difference in price between the machines meant that each year, Atari sold more units than Intellivision, lengthening its lead despite inferior graphics.",
              "[29] The Atari 2600 sold over 30 million units over its lifetime, considerably more than any other console of the second generation.",
              "[30] In 1982, Atari released the Atari 5200 in an attempt to compete with the Intellivision.",
              "While superior to the 2600, poor sales and lack of new games meant Atari only supported it for two years before it was discontinued.",
              "[31] Early Atari 2600 cartridges contained 2 kilobytes of read-only storage.",
              "This limit grew steadily from 1978 to 1983: up to 16 kilobytes for Atari 5200 cartridges.",
              "Bank switching, a technique that allowed two different parts of the program to use the same memory addresses, was required for the larger cartridges to work.",
              "The Atari 2600 cartridges got as large as 32 kilobytes through this technique.",
              "[32] The Atari 2600 had only 128 bytes of RAM available in the console.",
              "A few late game cartridges contained a combined RAM/ROM chip, thus adding another 256 bytes of RAM inside the cartridge itself.",
              "The Atari standard joystick was a digital controller with a single button, released in 1977.",
              "[33] The Bally Astrocade was released in 1977 and was available only through mail order.",
              "[34] It was originally referred to as the Bally Home Library Computer.",
              "[34][35] Delays in the production meant that none of the units shipped until 1978.",
              "By this time, the machine had been renamed the Bally Professional Arcade.",
              "[35] In this form, it sold mostly at computer stores and had little retail exposure, unlike the Atari VCS.",
              "The rights to the console were sold to Astrovision in 1981.",
              "They re-released the unit with the BASIC cartridge included for free;",
              "this system was known as the Bally Computer System.",
              "[35] When Astrovision changed their name to Astrocade in 1982 they also changed the name of the console to the Astrocade to follow suit.",
              "It sold under this name until the video game crash of 1983 when it was discontinued.",
              "[36] In 1978, Magnavox released its microprocessor-based console, the Odyssey 2, in the United States and Canada.",
              "[37] It was distributed by Philips Electronics in the European market and was released as the Philips G7000.",
              "[38] A defining feature of the system was the speech synthesis unit add-on which enhanced music, sound effects and speech capabilities.",
              "[39] The Odyssey2 was also known for its fusion of board and video games.",
              "Some titles came with a game board and pieces which players had to use in conjunction to play the game.",
              "Although the Odyssey2 never became as popular as the Atari consoles, it sold 2 million units throughout its lifetime.",
              "This made it the third best selling console of the generation.",
              "[40] It was discontinued in 1984.",
              "[41] The Intellivision was introduced by Mattel to test markets in 1979[42] and nationally in 1980.",
              "The Intellivision console contained a 16-bit processor with 16-bit registers and 16-bit system RAM.",

              "It also featured an advanced sound chip that could deliver output through three distinct sound channels.",
              "[43] The Intellivision was the first console with a thumb-pad directional controller and tile-based playfields with vertical and horizontal scrolling.",
              "The system's initial production run sold out shortly after its national launch in 1980.",
              "[43] Early cartridges were 4 kilobyte ROMs, which grew to 24 kilobytes for later games.",
              "The Intellivision introduced several new features to the second generation.",
              "It was the first home console to use a 16-bit microprocessor and offer downloadable content through the PlayCable service.",
              "[44] It also provided real-time human voices during gameplay.",
              "It was the first console to pose a serious threat to Atari's dominance.",
              "A series of TV advertisements featuring George Plimpton were run.",

              "[43] It sold over 3 million units[45] before being discontinued in 1990.",
              "[46] The ColecoVision was introduced by toy manufacturer Coleco in August 1982.",
              "It was more powerful than previous consoles, providing an experience that was closer to Arcades than what the 2600 could provide.",
              "[47] The console launched with several arcade ports, including Sega's Zaxxon, and later saw third-party support from many developers such as Activision and even their competitor Atari.",
              "[48] The ColecoVision is notable for its Atari 2600 expansion module, which enabled the console to play 2600 games, resulting in a lawsuit from Atari.",
              "[49] The ColecoVision was a victim of the video game crash, ultimately being discontinued in 1985.",

              "Talk about good timing too, as I just managed to find my specific moving box with my original \u201cVideo Computer System\u201d inside, meaning I'm able to specifically check how much in common both systems actually have.",
              "This might not come as a surprise given its price tag, but the new revamped system feels almost exactly like a smaller version of the real deal.",
              "Only a few tiny differences manage to break the wave of \u201870s immersion this thing provides, and I almost wish it wasn\u2019t completely dedicated to the retro-nostalgic cause.",

              "Naturally, the other showstopping element is the cartridge slot atop the Atari 2600 +, situated exactly where it\u2019s supposed to be.",
              "I can\u2019t express how much I appreciate this contribution to physical preservation, as it\u2019ll hopefully mean new players and old-school fans will have a reliable, and accurate way to play original carts for long into the future.",
              "I\u2019ll touch on my thoughts regarding how to actually achieve this in a bit, but the fact it does it at all is a huge win.",
              "The same goes for the fact it uses original 9-pin joystick ports rather than coming with glorified PC controllers, as this is something I\u2019ve been itching for since the release of the NES Classic and Sega Genesis Mini.",
              "There are a few nice extras that the Atari 2600+ features, and they\u2019re easy to miss if you don\u2019t inspect the back.",
              "For example, there\u2019s a switch that\u2019ll let you toggle between 4:3 and 16:3 output, which is going to please anyone who can\u2019t stand letterboxing.",
              "Personally, I\u2019d never dream of stretching an image just to fill my display, but I can understand why having slightly wider characters in something like Berzerk isn\u2019t as detrimental as playing a PS2 game in widescreen.",
              "At a glance, the Atari 2600+ looks exactly like \u2018four switcher\u2019 VCS, and you\u2019d be forgiven for not really noticing the difference.",
              "In a way, this specific console reminds me a lot of the PC Engine mini, as apart from the fact that it doesn\u2019t have a cart slot, it\u2019s effectively a slightly smaller like-for-like.",
              "You could even say the size difference is comparable to the original PS5 vs the new slim model, which could be a sign that the adorable tiny console craze is well and truly over.",
              "Upon getting hold of the Atari 2600+, it was immediately clear that the new version is a different beast to the original, and so it should be.",
              "Don\u2019t let the use of antiquated controller ports and cartridge slots fool you, this is a new system made from newer materials, and it\u2019d be weird if it felt exactly like its ancestor.",
              "That said, it definitely feels like it shares the same DNA with the metal switches on the front featuring a similar thunk sound to the original when toggled.",
              "The overall geometry and accent design aspects like the top ridges also feel very much like something that actually came from the \u201870s Atari, although I\u2019m slightly peeved that the marvellous woodgrain bumper on the front is giving less red oak and more something akin to a piece of 2000s flatpack furniture.",
              "Thankfully, that gripe is quashed by the fact the Atari logo on the front of the console glows white, making it look like a hyped-up version of the system from a forgotten commercial in the best way possible.",
              "I\u2019m chuckling away to myself at the idea of Atari 2600+ performance, as this is normally where I\u2019d talk about frame rates and benchmarks.",
              "Rather than doing any of that, I want to focus on the experience the console provides both in terms of authenticity and feel.",
              "That\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t put the system\u2019s visuals under the microscope, as I was keen to see whether classic games would look the part and feel good to play.",
              "Thankfully, Atari and PLAION\u2019s revamp checks all the boxes on that front, providing clean and accurate visuals compared to my OG console comrade.",
              "The sound is also on point too, as I\u2019d have been greatly disappointed if my bleeps sounded like bloops.",
              "I did feel like HDMI output felt a tad darker compared to my original setup, but the difference wasn\u2019t enough to make me want to revert to static-y nonsense.",
              "To put the system to the test, I used a mix of both new release 2600 cartridges, namely Berserk, Mr Run and Jump Man, and two multicarts, alongside originals like Pacman and Warlords.",
              "If you\u2019d told me I was using all carts from over 40 years ago, I\u2019d probably believe you without question, as the fresh ones perform exactly like my old ones, even when paired with the older VCS system.",
              "Again, I\u2019m giggling, as I\u2019m about to start dunking on the Atari 2600+ for load times.",
              "Yup, the new system has a loading screen, and that\u2019s pretty funny considering the historic, instantaneous nature of cartridges.",
              "There is a good reason why this is a thing, and it ties to the fact that the 2600+ has to pull each cart\u2019s ROM into memory so it can run it using emulation.",
              "The short 10-second wait also isn\u2019t a dealbreaker, but I can\u2019t help but wish there was more to look at on-screen while it\u2019s happening.",
              "You\u2019ll be greeted by a big static Atari logo before a brief stint looking at a black load screen, and I feel like this would have been the perfect opportunity to throw in some cool visual easter eggs, perhaps an animation on screen like the previously mentioned PC Engine mini provides.",
              "I\u2019d even take some pseudo-antenna interference, just for nostalgia\u2019s sake.",
              "On that note, I want to touch on something from my wish list, as I think I was expecting more from the Atari 2600+ on a software level.",
              "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not looking for a full-blown operating system or complicated features, but some sort of central interface with additional settings would have been nice.",
              "I\u2019m so used to retro systems like the Evercade and Super Pocket providing access to things like scanlines that I almost forgot to think about whether they\u2019d be included in the 2600+, especially at its price point.",
              "I also totally get that the approach here was to make a system that focuses on replicating the original experience, but I feel like it\u2019s entirely possible to balance both, especially if you want to cater to younger players used to a bit more software substance.",
              "Circling back to the hardware side of things, I have to commend the Atari 2600+ for its absurdly accurate joysticks and paddles.",
              "The only thing that visually spoils a game of \u2018spot the difference\u2019 when comparing my original controller to the new one is the fact the colors on mine are slightly faded.",
              "Other than that, both look and feel almost identical.",
              "I will say that mine feels a bit more clicky than the newcomer, but I honestly think that\u2019s more a symptom of the contact pads within wearing down rather than a tactical boon.",
              "Not that either of the two feel great compared to modern gamepads, and I tend to use a Sega controller with 9-pin ports.",
              "However, we\u2019re comparing apples to apples here, and the difference is uncanny.",
              "It\u2019s needless to say the Atari 2600+ is made with a specific audience in mind, and if you\u2019re the type of person that likes to play around with the classics in your spare time, this reimagined retro system is for you.",
              "I do think it\u2019ll also appeal to younger generations of players looking to explore the annals of video game history, but that\u2019s only if they want to get their hands on something that almost feels like the real deal with less of the faff.",
              "I do wish the Atari 2600+ had a tiny bit more to offer on the software side of things, and I think distracting players from pulling cart ROMs into an emulator is necessary.",
              "If the console instead used FPGA (field programmable gate array) tech to run games, that would have been a different story, as that\u2019d mean we\u2019re dealing with replication on a circuit level.",
              "However, that\u2019s not the case here, so while it\u2019s by no means a deal breaker, I think many of you out there will be left craving more when you flick the switch.",
              "Ultimately, I would recommend buying the Atari 2600+ if you\u2019re really into the idea of easily playing the console\u2019s library on a modern screen.",
              "It\u2019ll also come in handy if you\u2019re a Twitch streamer too, as all you\u2019ll need is a single HDMI cable that\u2019ll feed directly into a capture card.",
              "At $129.",
              "99, it isn\u2019t the cheapest way to play old Atari games by any means, but its dedication to a bygone hardware experience will, at the very least, put a smile on your face.",
              "Put it this way, after 46 years, I might retire my original console, as the newcomer is a worthy successor.",
              "For a week, played Atari games in my spare time using the new 2600+ console hooked up to a Samsung 4K TV.",
              "I used a mix of my own cartridges and new re-releases, alongside a selection of compatible 9-pin controllers and joysticks.",
              "To assess accuracy, I also played games like Berzerk, Pacman, and Yars Revenge on the original VCS console so as to compare sound and output.",

              "This painstaking reproduction of one of the earliest and most beloved games consoles is light on games, but heavy on nostalgic kick The Atari 2600 is, for a certain generation of gamers, the most nostalgia-igniting console ever made.",
              "From its wood veneer fascia to its chunky carts and the legendary CX40 joystick, the machine evokes the very dawn of the games industry, before Sony, Microsoft or even Nintendo arrived to dominate it all.",
              "Even for those of us never fortunate enough to own one, the image of it was everywhere, from Grattan catalogues and comic book adverts, to TV programmes and movies such as ET, Electric Dreams and Gremlins.",
              "It was a machine that brought seminal arcade experiences to 30m homes around the world.",
              "Now it is back as the 2600+, in a mini format, with HDMI connectivity for modern TVs and a cartridge slot that will play not just newly manufactured carts, but most of the original 2600 and later 7800 titles.",
              "Perhaps even more than the mini consoles from Sega, Sony and Nintendo, it captures the technical and aesthetic features of the original machine.",
              "As well as two joystick ports (which allow you to plug in the original pads, if you have any that still work), the console has switches to select game difficulty, as well as reset and choose game modes, and you can opt between colour and black and white graphics \u2013 all features from the original 2600 models.",
              "You even get a reproduction of that wooden front panel.",
              "Fans of the original will get a rush of memories with every flick of the power switch and jab at the fire button.",
              "For just under \u00a3100 you get the machine itself, all the necessary cables (you\u2019ll need a USB plug), plus one CX40 joystick and a 10-in-one cart featuring Combat, Missile Command, Video Pinball and other classics.",
              "Other games are available to buy at \u00a325 each, and you can purchase a package containing two paddle controllers for \u00a330 which also comes with a four-game cart featuring Breakout, Night Driver, Canyon Bomber and Video Olympics.",
              "There\u2019s no getting away from it \u2013 this is an expensive way to relive those old days of blocky graphics and bleeping sound effects.",
              "The latest in the officially licensed Atari Flashback series of consoles, by contrast, is available for around \u00a380 and comes with over 100 games built in.",
              "This series has also included rare and prototype games and comes with two controllers.",
              "The build quality isn\u2019t as good, but if you just want to jump on and play a few ancient shoot-\u2019em-ups, it\u2019s good value.",

              "If you\u2019re just keen to reminisce about the old days, when Atari ruled, and this odd console looked at home beside the gargantuan wooden-boxed TVs of the late 1970s, the Atari 2600+ is an attractive, well-built piece of kit.",
              "Put it in your living room and it will bring instant nostalgic warmth, while the games themselves will remind both old and new players what it meant to own a console 40 years ago: surreal, minimalist visuals, no title screens, often no high score tables or game over sequences \u2013 just the most rudimentary of interactions between player and screen.",

              "[5][6] In the first year of production (1977), Atari manufactured the CX2600 with heavy aluminum radio-frequency shielding as well as 1\u20442-inch-thick (12 mm) plastic bottom half.",
              "These early units are differentiated from subsequent units by their thick plastic molding on the sides of the case, the curved molding on the front of the unit, as well as their heavier weight.",
              "Due to their heavier weight, these early consoles are sometimes referred to as \"Heavy Sixers\".",
              "[4] The majority of the Heavy Sixer consoles were manufactured in Sunnyvale, California, after which Atari moved most console manufacturing overseas.",
              "[5] Originally these consoles came with a grey power supply and spring-loaded joysticks, which differed slightly from the later models.",
              "[7] Due to the generally higher quality parts and components that are used in these early models, collectors and enthusiasts claim that the Heavy Sixers have superior color to the subsequent 4 switch and Light Sixer models.",

              "[9] Sears also sold their own \"Sears\" branded paddle controllers for the Heavy Sixer.",
              "[9] These models were introduced in 1978 and stayed in production for about two years.",

              "[4] These models also have two different designs, but retained much of the same plastic moldings as the Light Sixer.",
              "The major difference between the four-switch models and the Light Sixer is that there are only four switches on the main control panel.",
              "The two difficulty switches were moved from the front of the console to the upper back, alongside the controller ports, power jack, and channel selection switch (which was no longer optional but now included on all North American consoles).",

              "This model was introduced in 1980.",
              "Some early examples of this console used the same lower case mold as the light sixers, with a piece of thin plastic adhered over several now-unneeded holes.",

              "But if you look a little more closely at the connector, you might see something you didn\u2019t expect to see hiding under the molded plastic: A set of female connectors that look a lot like a traditional serial port.",
              "So, how did this happen\u2014that this port that is so widely used by gamers got rebranded for the living room, and that design aside, it is essentially a serial port?",
              "To answer that question, we need to go all the way back to 1952, when the adapter-designing firm Cannon Electronics first came up for its concept of the multipurpose D-subminiature connectors.",
              "These connectors are as close to a building block of technology as we are likely to get, and they were developed by a company called Cannon Electronics, which is still active today as ITT Cannon.",

              "(Aviation Week/Internet Archive) While Cannon had started in radio electronics, World War II changed the company\u2019s focus into more technical solutions for airplanes, and by the time the early 1950s rolled around, there was a sudden need for a system of connectors that could be developed for any use case and could shrink or expand based on need.",
              "(Google Patents) From the patent filing for the technology, it makes clear that the d-subminiature was not meant to be a static design: While the instant invention has been shown and de scribed herein in what is conceived to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is recognized that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention, which is therefore not to be limited to the details disclosed herein but is to be accorded the full scope of the claims. While ITT Cannon still makes this technology in numerous very specific forms, it did let the patent for the technology expire in 1974, a fortuitous bit of timing, as it meant that the technology was patent-free and available for anyone to use just as the personal computer and the video game console were first emerging on the market.",
              "And use them, they did.",
              "The connector, in its various shapes was widely used in the early years of the computer revolution, arguably in some cases well past its sell-by date.",

              "But in many ways, it was Atari\u2019s hardware developer on the VCS, the subsidiary company Cyan Engineering, that had the inspiration that led to the design.",
              "by removing the outer framing of the port and wrapping the connectors around a thicker piece of plastic, the result was that the controller didn\u2019t need quite the level of electromagnetic shielding that the standard port was designed to offer.",
              "It was a bit of a kludge\u2014a way to save a few bucks in a format where it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be life or death if the connector fell out.",

              "While Mattel and Coleco implemented lockout measures to control third-party development (the ColecoVision BIOS checked for a copyright string on power-up), the Atari 2600 was completely unprotected and once information on its hardware became available, little prevented anyone from making games for the system.",
              "Nintendo thus instituted a strict licensing policy for the NES that included equipping the cartridge and console with lockout chips, which were region-specific, and had to match in order for a game to work.",

              "Under pressure from Namco and Hudson Soft, it opened the Famicom to third-party development, but instituted a license fee of 30% per game cartridge for these third-parties to develop games, a system used by console manufactures to this day.",
              "[64] Nintendo maintained strict manufacturing control and requiring payment in full before manufacturing.",

              "[65] Nintendo's strong-armed oversight of Famicom cartridge manufacturing led to both legitimate and bootleg unlicensed cartridges to be made in the Asian regions.",
              "Nintendo placed its Nintendo Seal of Quality on all licensed games released for the system to try to promote authenticity and detract from bootleg sales, but failed to make significant traction to stalling these sales.",
              "[66] As Nintendo prepared to release the Famicom in the United States, it wanted to avoid both the bootleg problem it had in Asia as well as the mistakes that led up to the 1983 crash.",
              "The company created the proprietary 10NES system, a lockout chip which was designed to prevent cartridges made without the chip from being played on the NES.",
              "The 10NES lockout was not perfect, as later in the NES' lifecycle methods were found to bypass it, but it did sufficiently allow Nintendo to strengthen its publishing control to avoid the mistakes Atari had made and initially prevent bootleg cartridges in the Western markets.",
              "[67] These strict licensing measures backfired somewhat after Nintendo was accused of monopolistic behavior.",
              "[68] In the long run, this pushed many western third-party publishers such as Electronic Arts away from Nintendo consoles and supported competing consoles such as the Sega Genesis or Sony PlayStation.",

              "With waning console interests in the United States, the computer game market was able to gain a strong foothold in 1983 and beyond.",
              "[60] Developers that had been primarily in the console games space, like Activision, turned their attention to developing computer game titles to stay viable.",
              "[60] Newer companies also were founded to capture the growing interest in the computer games space with novel elements that borrowed from console games, as well as taking advantage of low-cost dial-up modems that allowed for multiplayer capabilities.",
              "[60] The computer game market grew between 1983 and 1984, overtaking the console market, but overall video game revenue had declined significantly due to the considerable decline of the console market as well as the arcade market to an extent.",

              "[16] Partly as a distant knock-on effect of the crash and partly due to the continuing quality of homegrown computer and microcomputer games, consoles did not achieve a dominant position in some European markets until the early 1990s.",
              "[70] In the United Kingdom, there was a short-lived home console market between 1980 and 1982, but the 1983 crash led to the decline of consoles in the UK, which was offset by the rise of LCD games in 1983 and then the rise of computer games in 1984.",

              "[24] It was engineered by the same team,[25] including Hideki Sato and Masami Ishikawa, who had worked on the II and later led development of the Sega Genesis.",
              "[26] According to Sato, the console was designed because of the limitations of the TMS9918 graphics chip in the SG-1000 and II, which did not have the power for the kinds of games Sega wanted to make.",

              "[25] Its marketing department was run by only two people, giving Sega a disadvantage in advertising.",
              "[25] As one method of promoting the console, at the end of 1987 Sega partnered with astronaut Scott Carpenter to start the \"Sega Challenge\", a traveling program set up in recreational centers where kids were tested on non-verbal skills such as concentration and the ability to learn new skills.",
              "Out Run and Shooting Gallery were two games included in the challenge.",
              "[36] In 1987, amid struggling sales in the US,[29] Sega sold the US distribution rights for the Master System to the toy company Tonka, which had no experience with electronic entertainment systems.[20] The thinking at Sega behind the deal was to leverage Tonka's knowledge of the American toy market, since Nintendo had marketed the NES as a toy to great success in the region.",
              "[29] The announcement was made shortly after the 1987 Summer CES.",
              "[37] During this time, much of Sega of America's infrastructure shifted from marketing and distribution to focus on customer service, and Lowry departed the company.",
              "[29] Tonka blocked localization of several popular Japanese games,[20] and during 1988 were less willing to purchase EPROMs needed for game cartridge manufacture during a shortage.",

              "It was distributed by Mastertronic in the United Kingdom, Master Games in France, and Ariolasoft in West Germany,[38] though Ariolasoft initially purchased the distribution rights for the United Kingdom.",
              "[39][40][41] Because Ariolasoft could not agree to a pricing agreement with Sega, Mastertronic signed a deal in 1987 to take control of UK distribution, and announced the deal at the 1987 Summer CES.",

              "The newly rebranded Virgin Mastertronic took over all European distribution in 1988.",
              "[38] Virgin Mastertronic focused marketing the Master System on ports of Sega's arcade games and positioning it as a superior video game alternative to the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum computers.",
              "As a result of this marketing and of Nintendo's less effective early approaches in Europe, the Master System began to attract European developers.",

              "Their success distributing Sega's laser tag gun based on the anime Zillion gave Sega the confidence to allow Tectoy to distribute the Master System.",
