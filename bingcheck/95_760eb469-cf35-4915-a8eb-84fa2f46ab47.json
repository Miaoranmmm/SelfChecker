              "This cave art consists of numerous cupules - non-utilitarian hemispherical cup-shaped depressions - hammered out of the rock surface.",
              "Geological investigations of the prehistoric sites by renowned archeologists Bednarik, Kumar and others, have established that this rock art pre-dates the Acheulean culture of the Lower Paleolithic era, and must therefore date from at least 290,000 BCE.",
              "However, once more advanced dating methods become available, it is conceivable that these petroglyphs will turn out to be much older - perhaps originating as early as 700,000 BCE - although at present this is mere speculation.",

              "What are Petroglyphs?",
              "- A Definition The term \"petroglyph\" stems from two Greek words (\"petros\" meaning rock, and \"glyphein\" meaning to carve) and means simply \"rock carving.\"",
              "Location The two prehistoric caves where the world's earliest art was found, are located in the Madhya Pradesh region of central India.",
              "Thus at present it seems that the art of India is considerably older than African art, hitherto assumed to comprise the earliest artistic tradition.",

              "Within the Auditorium cave complex, archeologists have found eleven petroglyphs.",
              "Nine cupules (cup-shape hollows) were first discovered in a large vertical boulder face above ground level.",
              "A little later, a tenth cupule along with a single meandering groove, indisputably associated with it, were found covered by remains dating from the Acheulian period.",
              "These petroglyphs were created on heavily recrystallized, very hard quartzite that was extensively mined during the Lower Palaeolithic.",
              "The majority of Acheulian chopping tools (hand axes, cleavers) found at the site are made from it.",
              "The petroglyphs were located in a weatherproof section in the heart of the cave, but significant corrosion had taken place due to their exceptional antiquity.",
              "The coincidence of the two buried petroglyphs and the nine above ground cupules suggests that all were created at the same time, and this was confirmed by micro-erosion tests.",
              "While no radiometric dating information is available from the Auditorium cave site, the Acheulian culture of India is comparable with that of Africa and Europe, and all radiometric dates so far for such cultural relics have been greater than 290,000 years.",
              "In India, the Later Acheulian dates to roughly 500,000-700,000 BCE and the Final Acheulian to roughly 200,000 BCE.",
              "Thus the Bhimbetka petroglyphs would fall at least within this range and possibly some will prove to have been created during the Early or Middle Acheulian (that is, before 700,000 BCE).",
              "Daraki-Chattan Rock Shelter At a second Stone Age site at Daraki-Chattan, a small, narrow and deep cave in the Indragarh Hill, near Tehsil Bhanpura, Madhya Pradesh, archeologists found two vertical panels densely pitted with 498 cupules dating from a Lower Palaeolithic chopping tool culture.",
              "A quantity of hammerstones used to create these cupules were also recovered.",

              "Although the age of Daraki-Chattan's rock art still has to be determined, archeological evidence at the site tentatively suggests that it is contemporaneous with the cupules at Bhimbetka cave.",

              "According to Robert G.",
              "Bednarik, there is no reasonable doubt that some or all of the petroglyphs at the Auditorium cave, were created by people of a Lower Palaeolithic tool culture characterized by hand choppers, like those belonging to the African Oldowan culture, and therefore pre-dating the Acheulian, which began in India around 1.",
              "6 million BCE.",

              "[2] d'Errico and Nowell's argument that the \"arm\"-shaped grooves suggest a symbolic nature of the object was questioned by three commentators: Joa\u0303o Zilha\u0303o from the Instituto Portugue\u0302s de Arqueologia, Thomas Wynn from the University of Colorado, and Steven Mithen from the University of Reading.",
              "[3] All of them suggested that the object and its grooves could have a utilitarian purpose.",

              "Wynn suggested that the object could be a result of \"someone passing time with a stone tool and a pebble\".",
              "Mithen also stated that our symbolic understanding of the object does not imply that it was considered as such by early humans who produced it, because the cognitive processes for symbolic thinking we use today may differ from the ones used by early humans.",
              "d'Errico and Nowell argued, however, that, although their analysis and results cannot refute a functional interpretation of the object, there are too many inconsistencies in this interpretation to investigate it any further.",

              "Because the six thin lines crossed by three additional lines end abruptly at the edge of the stone, the scientists think they were part of a larger design on a grindstone cobble that helped process ochre rocks into powder used to make paint.",
              "Microscopic examination and experimental reproduction of the design revealed that some of narrow the lines had been made with single strokes of an ochre crayon, which must have been hard and pointed, while others were made with a rubbing motion.",

              "The pebble was modified by early humans and is suggested to represent a female human figure.",
              "[1][2] The object was excavated and first described by Naama Goren-Inbar from the Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.",
              "[1] The artifact is a scoria pebble, 35 mm long, 25 mm wide, and 21 mm thick.",
              "It weighs approximately 10 g.",
              "It was excavated in 1981 at the Acheulian site of Berekhat Ram, Golan Heights.",
              "The object is dated 280,000-250,000 BP.",
              "[2][3] Goren-Inbar reported several artificial grooves on the object: one is a transversal groove in the upper third, others are longitudinal grooves on the sides below the traversal groove.",
              "[1] Alexander Marshack performed a microscopic study of the object in 1997.",
              "[2] He also reported artificial modifications including the transversal and longitudinal grooves found by Goren-Inbar.",
              "Finally, Francesco d'Errico and April Nowell re-examined the object using a comparative approach.",
              "[3] They partly confirmed, partly corrected the findings of Marshack.",
              "d'Errico and Nowell also reported the above grooves (with some corrections) and, additionally, reported areas of possible abrasion on the front, back and bottom of the object.",
              "Goren-Inbar[1] and Marshack[2] suggested that the object resembled a female body and was artificially modified by hominids to emphasize its anthropomorphic features.",
              "The object was then called a figurine and is currently known as the Venus of Berekhat Ram (the term \"Venus\" was taken from the conventional name of much younger Venus figurines of Upper Paleolithic).",
              "If this hypothesis is correct, the object would be the earliest example of representational art in the archaeological record, together with the Venus of Tan-Tan.",
              "d'Errico and Nowell[3] confirmed the artificial nature of modifications of the object, but refrained from identifying it with a human body.",
              "They noted that grooves, in general, may have a functional purpose.",
              "Still, they stated that the longitudinal symmetrical U-shaped grooves (supposedly representing the \"arms\") are hard to explain functionally.",
              "So, similarly to Goren-Inbar and Marshack, d'Errico and Nowell argued in favor of the non-utilitarian and symbolic nature of the object.",
              "The main discussion around the Venus of Berekhat Ram took place after the study of d'Errico and Nowell.",
              "[3] A number of scholars, namely, Ofer Bar-Yosef, Angela E.",
              "Close, Joa\u0303o Zilha\u0303o, Steven Mithen, Thomas G.",
              "Wynn, and Alexander Marshack, commented on that study, while d'Errico and Nowell provided a reply to these comments (both the comments and reply are included in the manuscript).",
              "[3] The discussion around the Venus of Berekhat Ram concerned three questions: All commentators of d'Errico and Nowell's study were convinced by their analysis and results and accepted the hypothesis that the object was modified by early humans.",
              "[3] Marshack argued in favor of this hypothesis already in his earlier study of the object.",
              "[2] d'Errico and Nowell's argument that the \"arm\"-shaped grooves suggest a symbolic nature of the object was questioned by three commentators: Joa\u0303o Zilha\u0303o from the Instituto Portugue\u0302s de Arqueologia, Thomas Wynn from the University of Colorado, and Steven Mithen from the University of Reading.",
              "[3] All of them suggested that the object and its grooves could have a utilitarian purpose.",
              "Zilha\u0303o hypothesized that the object could be used to produce pigment and that the grooves could be byproducts of this process.",
              "Wynn suggested that the object could be a result of \"someone passing time with a stone tool and a pebble\".",
              "Mithen also stated that our symbolic understanding of the object does not imply that it was considered as such by early humans who produced it, because the cognitive processes for symbolic thinking we use today may differ from the ones used by early humans.",
              "d'Errico and Nowell argued, however, that, although their analysis and results cannot refute a functional interpretation of the object, there are too many inconsistencies in this interpretation to investigate it any further.",
              "For example, d'Errico and Nowell suggested that, based on the existing Acheulean archaeological record, pigment \"would have been more quickly and effectively produced by grinding one face of this object against a basalt flake or smashing it with a similar tool\", which is different from the process used to create the observed grooves.",
              "This contradicts the hypothesis of Zilha\u0303o.",
              "d'Errico and Nowell also believe that the grooves on the object are the result of a deliberate motion rather than of non-purposive behavior, as suggested by Wynn.",
              "Zilha\u0303o, Wynn, and Mithen rejected the hypothesis on the symbolic nature of the object and, thus, rejected the idea that the object is iconic.",
              "Angela E.",
              "Close from the University of Washington also could not see a figurine of a woman in the object, but, instead, the object reminded her of a penguin and a phallus when seen from different angles.",
