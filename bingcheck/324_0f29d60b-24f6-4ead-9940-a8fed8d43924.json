              "Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs.",
              "In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices.",
              "Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.",
              "After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success.",
              "Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills.",
              "He died in New York City in January 1943.",
              "[8] Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the International System of Units (SI) measurement of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor.",
              "There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.",

              "In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac[23][better source needed] to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.",
              "[24][25] Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor.",
              "[26] Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this \"mysterious phenomena\" made him want \"to know more of this wonderful force\".",
              "[27] Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.",
              "[28] He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.",
              "[29] After graduating Tesla returned to Smiljan but soon contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times.",
              "In a moment of despair, Tesla's father (who had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood),[30] promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.",
              "[23][better source needed] The next year Tesla evaded conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan[31] by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Grac\u030cac.",
              "There he explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb.",

              "In his autobiography Tesla said he worked hard and earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams[23][better source needed] (nearly twice as many as required[32]) and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\"",
              "[32] At Graz, Tesla noted his fascination with the detailed lectures on electricity presented by Professor Jakob Po\u0308schl and described how he made suggestions on improving the design of an electric motor the professor was demonstrating.",

              "Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor but he did not receive grades for the courses.",
              "[37][38] Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Puska\u0301s at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange.",
              "Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead.",
              "Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position.",
              "During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.",
              "[23][better source needed] In 1882, Tivadar Puska\u0301s got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.",
              "[39] Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility.",
              "The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Socie\u0301te\u0301 Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system.",
              "There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering.",
              "Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors.",
              "[40] They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.",
              "In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well.",
              "[42] In June 1884, Tesla emigrated[43] and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 \"field engineers\" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city.",
              "[44] As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators.",
              "[45] Historian W.",
              "Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times.",
              "[44] One of those times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their \"Parisian\" being out all night.",
              "After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon, Edison commented to Batchelor that \"this is a damned good man\".",
              "[41] One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp-based street lighting system.",
              "[46][47] Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in some cities.",
              "Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison made with an arc lighting company.",
              "[48] Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit.",
              "[44] What event precipitated his leaving is unclear.",
              "It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved.",
              "[46] Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned.",
              "[49][50] In his autobiography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design \"twenty-four different types of standard machines\" \"but it turned out to be a practical joke\".",
              "[51] Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping \"Tesla, you don't understand our American humor\".",
              "[52][53] The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay[54] and the company did not have that amount of cash (equal to $1,628,519 today) on hand.",
              "[55][56] Tesla's diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying \"Good by to the Edison Machine Works\".",
              "[47][57] Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system,[58] possibly the same one he had developed at Edison.",
              "[44] In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W.",
              "Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents.",
              "[58] Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company.",
              "[59] Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey.",
              "[60] Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.",
              "The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment.",
              "After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility.",
              "[61] They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless.",
              "[61] Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock.",
              "[61] He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day.",
              "Later in life Tesla recounted that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing \"My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery\".",
              "[61][62] In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S.",
              "Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck.",
              "[63] The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain.",
              "[64] Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea,[65] they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents.",
              "Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1\u20443 to Tesla, 1\u20443 to Peck and Brown, and 1\u20443 to fund development.",
              "[64] They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.",
              "In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission.",
              "The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882).",
              "[66][67][68] This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.",
              "[69][70] Along with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged to get the motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrently with the issue of the patent.",
              "[71] Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.",
              "[71][72] Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system\u2014something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing.",
              "Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.",
              "[73][74] In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.",
              "50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor.",
              "Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($65,100 in today's dollars[75]) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.",
              "[76] During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars.",
              "He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power.",
              "Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found that it would not work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed.",
              "They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.",
              "[77][78] Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies.",
              "[79][80] The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company, were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting each other.",
              "There was even a \"war of currents\" propaganda campaign going on, with Edison Electric claiming their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system and Thomson-Houston sometimes siding with Edison.",
              "[81][82] Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related polyphase system right away.",
              "[83] Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble.",
              "The near collapse of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in their loans to Westinghouse Electric.",
              "[84] The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts.",
              "The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract.",
              "[85][86] At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development.",
              "[83][84] Westinghouse was paying a $15,000-a-year guaranteed royalty[87] even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it was even rarer.",
              "[69][84] In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, if he did not meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties.",
              "[88] The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract.",
              "[88][89] Six years later Westinghouse purchased Tesla's patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent-sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison and Thomson-Houston).",
              "[90][91][92] The money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests.",
              "[93] In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years worked out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan.",
              "These included a lab at 175 Grand Street (1889\u20131892), the fourth floor of 33\u201335 South Fifth Avenue (1892\u20131895), and sixth and seventh floors of 46 & 48 East Houston Street (1895\u20131902).",
              "[94][95] Tesla and his hired staff conducted some of his most significant work in these workshops.",
              "In the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz's 1886\u20131888 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves.",
              "[96] Tesla found this new discovery \"refreshing\" and decided to explore it more fully.",
              "[citation needed] In repeating and then expanding on these experiments Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high-frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil.",
              "To fix this problem Tesla came up with his \"oscillating transformer\", with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil.",
              "[97] Later called the Tesla coil, it would be used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity.",
              "[98] He would use this resonant transformer circuit in his later wireless power work.",
              "[99][100] On 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States.",
              "[101][102] In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil.",
              "[103] After 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil.",
              "[104] He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage.",
              "[105] He spent most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings.",
              "[106] In 1893 at St.",
              "Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric Light Association, Tesla told onlookers that he was sure a system like his could eventually conduct \"intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires\" by conducting it through the Earth.",
              "[107][108] Tesla served as a vice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1892 to 1894, the forerunner of the modern-day IEEE (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers).",
              "[109] By the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F.",
              "Scott and then Benjamin G.",
              "Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor.",
              "Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system it would need compatible with older single-phase AC and DC systems by developing a rotary converter.",
              "[110] Westinghouse Electric now had a way to provide electricity to all potential customers and started branding their polyphase AC system as the \"Tesla Polyphase System\".",
              "They believed that Tesla's patents gave them patent priority over other polyphase AC systems.[111] Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in the \"Electricity Building\" devoted to electrical exhibits.",
              "Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of an alternating current system that was polyphase and could also supply the other AC and DC exhibits at the fair.",
              "[112][113][114] A special exhibit space was set up to display various forms and models of Tesla's induction motor.",
              "The rotating magnetic field that drove them was explained through a series of demonstrations including an Egg of Columbus that used the two-phase coil found in an induction motor to spin a copper egg making it stand on end.",
              "[115] Tesla visited the fair for a week during its six-month run to attend the International Electrical Congress and put on a series of demonstrations at the Westinghouse exhibit.",
              "[116][117] A specially darkened room had been set up where Tesla showed his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe;",
              "[118] these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light wireless gas-discharge lamps.",
              "[119] An observer noted: Within the room were suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil.",
              "These were about fifteen feet apart and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers.",
              "When the current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous.",
              "These were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about two years previous, \"where they produced so much wonder and astonishment\".",
              "[120] During his presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall, Tesla introduced his steam powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year, something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current.",
              "[121] Steam was forced into the oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature.",
              "The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field.",
              "This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent.",
              "It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.",
              "[122][123] In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls.",
