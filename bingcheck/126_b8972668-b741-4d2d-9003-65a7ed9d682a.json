    "response": "That's a very interesting question. Martial arts are various fighting sports or skills, mainly of East Asian origin, such as kung fu, judo, karate, and kend\u014d[^1^]. They can be divided into the armed and unarmed arts, and have different purposes such as combat, self-defense, spiritual development, or health[^1^].\n\nThe origins of martial arts are difficult to trace, but the earliest evidence of martial arts goes back millennia, to depictions of fights in ancient art and literature, and analysis of archaeological evidence of weaponry[^2^]. Some of the oldest examples are the Egyptian paintings showing some form of struggle dating back to 3400 BC[^2^], the wrestling techniques in a tomb of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt at Beni Hasan (c. 2000 BC)[^2^], and the fist fighting in the Minoan civilization dating to the 2nd millennium BCE[^2^].\n\nIn ancient China, the Yellow Emperor (2698 BC) is said to have introduced the martial arts as methods for hand-to-hand combat used by ancient Chinese soldiers[^3^]. He also wrote treatises on medicine, astrology and the martial arts[^2^]. The martial arts we recognize today had origins in the Shang and Zhou dynasties (17th century \u2013 256 BC)[^4^].\n\nMartial arts have evolved over time to become a global phenomenon, influenced by different cultures, philosophies, and historical events. Some of the factors that contributed to this evolution are:\n\n- The spread of Buddhism and Daoism, which introduced spiritual and meditative aspects to the martial arts[^1^].\n- The Mongol invasions of China, which forced many martial artists to flee to other regions or go underground[^3^].\n- The development of firearms, which reduced the importance of armed combat and led to more emphasis on unarmed techniques[^3^].\n- The contact with other cultures, such as Japan, Korea, India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and America, which resulted in cross-fertilization and adaptation of different styles and forms[^3^].\n- The modernization and globalization of the world, which increased the popularity and accessibility of martial arts through media, sports, education, and tourism[^3^].\n\nI hope this answer gives you a brief overview of the cultural and historical origins behind the practice of martial arts, and how it has evolved over time to become a global phenomenon.

              "[2] The original martial version of tahtib later evolved into an Egyptian folk dance with a wooden stick.",
              "[3][4] It is commonly described in English as a \"stick dance\", \"cane dance\",[5] \"stick-dancing game\", or as ritual mock combat accompanied by music.",
              "[6] Nowadays, the word tahtib encompasses both martial practice and performance art.",
              "It is mainly practiced today in Upper Egypt.",
              "Tahtib is regularly performed for tourists in Luxor[7] and Aswan.",
              "[8] The stick used in tahtib is about four feet in length and is called an asa, asaya, assaya, or nabboot.",
              "It is often flailed in large figure-eight patterns across the body with such speed that the displacement of air is loudly discernible.",
              "The oldest traces of tahtib were found on engravings from the archaeological site of Abusir, an extensive necropolis of the Old Kingdom period, located in the south-western suburbs of Cairo.",
              "On some of the reliefs of the Pyramid of Sahure (V dynasty, c.",
              "2500 BC);",
              "[9] the images and explanatory captions are particularly precise and accurate in their depiction of what seems to be military training using sticks.",
              "Tahtib, with archery and wrestling, was then among the three disciplines of warfare taught to soldiers.",

              "In addition to its role as military training, tahtib matches were also popular among peasants and farmers.",
              "The first evidence of the festive representation of tahtib can only be seen in the New Empire (1500 \u2013 1000 BC), as shown by the engravings on the walls of Luxor and Saqqa\u0302ra[12] Early Christian writings mention tahtib as a leisure activity and a popular art performed by men during weddings and celebrations.",
              "It is believed that tahtib developed as a game or performance art in this civilian context.",
              "As with its combative counterpart, the dance form of tahtib was originally performed by men, but female versions were later developed.",
              "In one form, the women dress as men and imitate the males.",
              "Another female variant is performed flirtatiously and with less aggression.",
              "The latter, called ra's el assaya (dance of the stick) is incorporated into cabaret or Raqs sharqi performances.",
              "The stick used for this dance is generally more lightweight and hooked at one end like a cane.",
              "It is often embellished with metallic-coloured foil or sequins.",
              "The costume is a simple baladi dress.",

              "[13] The right hand uses a heavier stick with a hooked head to beat out the dum (the deep sound from striking the center of the drum) which drive the heartbeat of the rhythm, while the left hand uses a light twig as a switch to produce rapid-fire staccato \"taks\" (the higher sound from striking the edge of the drum).",
              "Modern tahtib[14] is an attempt to re-explore the sources of tahtib as a fighting art, and to enrich them as a martial practice[15][16] by codifying the techniques and teaching them structurally.",
              "As in traditional tahtib, the main target is the opponent's head, as it is considered the most fragile and vulnerable part of the body.",
              "Consequently, techniques revolve around protecting one's own head while reaching the head of the opponent.",
              "Victory can be attained either by a single clean touch to the head, or three touches to the body.",
              "Unlike its traditional counterpart, modern tahtib allows both women[17] and men to practice in mixed groups.",

              "By Lee Clarke [Biography on bottom of feature] Taoism (or Daoism) is historically one of the main philosophical traditions and religious of China and it is based on the idea that the Dao (The Way) is the fundamental principle upon which order and harmony in the universe is based.",

              "This doesn\u2019t mean lazily not doing anything but instead means living in accordance and harmony with nature and the natural flow of things, not trying to impose ourselves on and thus disrupt, this natural state.",
              "[2] The Daoist tradition was already present in China when Buddhism first entered the country over the border from neighboring India around the 3rd Century BCE.",
              "The two religions came to heavily influence each other in China, and this Daoist influence on Buddhism \u2014 after the two started to interact with one another \u2014 helped shape history and philosophical belief in the region for centuries.",

              "Similarly, Daoist doctrine can feel familiar to Buddhists on doctrines of Emptiness (Sunyata) and Interconnectedness (Oneness, \u201cinterbe\u201d as Zen teacher Thich Nhat Hanh puts it.)",
              "The doctrine of Sunyata or \u2018emptiness\u2019 is often mistaken by Westerners to be a nihilistic concept \u2014 largely because the English word Emptiness is not the best translation of Shunyata.",

              "The Jin also introduced one of the first poison gas weapons in history, firing projectiles bound in wax and paper of 70 pounds of dried human waste, ground-up poisonous herbs, roots, and beetles packed in gunpowder.",
              "The projectiles were lit with a fuse and fired from a trebuchet, creating a deadly cloud of toxic fumes that killed or disabled anyone unfortunate enough to breathe in the poisonous dust.",

              "The Mongols launched attacks against the walls with ladders, but lost dozens of men to the incendiaries and the hot oil.",

              "The Mongols and their Chinese human shields dug trenches covered by cowhide up to the walls to undermine them, but the Jin dropped firebombs from chains onto the trenches that exploded with such force that they left only smoldering craters and no intact human remains.",
              "The siege dragged on for a year as starvation and disease began killing people on both sides of the walls, but the defenders, with more than a million people to feed, had the worst of it.",
              "Two Jin relief columns loaded down with food were intercepted by the Mongols, and some defenders in Beijing turned to cannibalism to survive.",
              "In June 1215, the Jin commander escaped to Kaifeng, where he was executed by the emperor for leaving his post.",

              "Despite the overwhelming victories, the Mongols were trapped in a long war of attrition in China.",
              "Rather than finish the conquest of the Jin, Genghis became sidetracked in 1217 in the destruction of Khwarezm (Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan), an Islamic holocaust in which more than a million people were massacred by the Mongols.",
              "During the campaign to conquer Khwarezm, the Mongols brought in thousands of Chinese engineers, siege engines, and crews to help reduce Islamic fortifications.",
              "In 1223, Genghis turned his attention back on the Jin.",
              "He sent a trusted general, Mukhulai, with 100,000 troops to attack Chang\u2019an, which was defended by 200,000 Jin troops.",
              "Mukhulai became ill and died.",
              "As soon as this happened, the Xi Xia troops abandoned the Mongol army, which in turn caused the siege to be abandoned.",
              "Genghis then hunted down and killed the Xi Xia troops who had deserted his army.",
              "Genghis himself died in 1227, probably from typhus, while planning yet another massive invasion of Jin.",

              "This sort of firearm and others were introduced and adopted by the Japanese sometime in the 15th century.",

              "I believe it was brought to Japan by the Portuguese), and the traditions that formed around the militaristic use of these weapons led to the later development of schools of Hojutsu (gunnery skills).",
              "Many of these schools had teachings on the use of the firearm in hand-to-hand combat based on common stances (kamae) in which the wielder might find himself (reloading, ready, marching, etc.)",
              "Many modern martial arts teach the use of the firearm as a weapon, both insisting or instructing in the proper discharge of the firearm, or its adaptation as a weapon.",
              "Systema Ryabko (commonly referred to only as Systema in the US) teaches a number of ways to adapt the pistol and the very common AK-XX (the 47 and 74 can be interchanged) weapons to hand-to-hand combat.",

              "This, I believe, is the real reason why Aikido or Muay Thai do not have gun-kata in them.",
              "As near as I have been able to tell, it is more due to the philosophy of most martial arts systems as firearms do not require the same skill and arguably grace that other weapons require.",

              "This tends to mesh well with the philosophy of most martial arts of not just being a way to defend yourself, but also a form of long term self improvement that firearms just don't offer.",
              "Some martial arts trace their lineage back to times that predate firearms. Other martial arts are more of sport arts and focus on point systems and forms. Others are for physical and mental fitness rather then actual combat.",
              "A martial art that would be used totally in real work scenarios where weapon use would be common or viable is pretty specific.",
              "But this by no means that there are no martial arts the focus on firearms. As started in other answers most law enforcement and military organisations teach weapon use, multiple firing positions, stances, grips, drills (kata's) and actions that are very much an art form.",
              "I would say that because of the requirements, legalities and logistics required to teach people how to use a gun, fire it and practice with it are outside the capabilities of most organizations other then government ones.",
              "Martial arts can be dangerous, but it's very seldom fatal, one tiny mistake with a firearm and someone can die, there is no margin for error.",
              "Most of the arts are very practical, and deal with things you will always have with you, such as your body, your sword (in some cultural roles, for some historical periods), etc.",
              "Martial arts meant for categories of people using weapons which include firearms naturally include firearms: systema, ninpo, etc.",
              "To some extent, it could be argued that the military is trained in a martial art regarding their weapon, as they become intimately acclimated to it.",
              "Since the arts are practical, it does not make sense to add a study of firearms when you, or the people likely to force you to use your skills, will likely not have a firearm.",
              "In today's world, the situation is a bit different - and if no one has managed to include firearms training in a traditional art, there may be many reasons: I know of at least one example (sorry, no source) of someone who has brought handgun manipulation into their bagua training.",

              "[5] The De'an Shoucheng Lu, an account of the siege of De'an in 1132 during the Jin\u2013Song Wars, records that Song forces used fire-lances against the Jurchen.",
              "[6] The proportion of saltpeter in the propellant was increased to maximize its power.",
              "[4] To better withstand that power, paper and bamboo fire-lance barrels were replaced with metal.",
              "[3] To leverage that power, shrapnel was replaced by projectiles whose size and shape filled the barrel more completely.",
              "[4] With this, the basic features of the gun emerged: a metal barrel, high-nitrate gunpowder, and a properly sized projectile.",

              "[19] However, it is unclear whether these were arquebuses or small cannons as late as 1444, but the fact that they were listed separately from cannons in mid-15th century inventories suggests that they were handheld firearms.[20] The musket first appeared in the Ottoman Empire by 1465.",

              "This firing mechanism was connected to both the serpentine and flash pan cover and designed so that whenever the trigger is pulled, the serpentine was lowered at the same time as flash pan cover opened, minimizing the priming powder's exposure to open air and thus reducing the risk of priming powder being blown away by strong wind or spoiled by rain.",
              "The combination of a trigger-operated flash pan cover and small copper rain cover mounted on a pendulum was considered a more sophisticated approach to the Japanese solution of covering the entire firing mechanism with a lacquered box, which could hamper aiming, shooting and reloading.",
              "The Chinese military book Wu Pei Chih (1621) describes Turkish muskets that used similar rack and pinion mechanisms, which were not known to have been used in European firearms at the time.",

              "[36] Across the 16th and 17th century, firearms played an important role in the Mughal military.",
              "Known as the tufang, Mughal emperor Akbar introduced many improvements in the matchlock.",
              "[38] However until the 18th century, firearms, because of their longer loading time, were inferior to longbows.",

              "Ryan, 2020), our ambition is to build a definition of health beyond a purely physiological or biomedical paradigm.",

              "As international texts such as that of Sa\u0301nchez Garci\u0301a and Spencer (2013) have shown, these ethnographic investigations pertain mainly to gender, culture, identity and violence through the apprenticeship into a particular martial arts subculture.",

              "These concepts are milestones in approaching embodied experience in MACS around the world (for a review, see Channon and Jennings, 2014).",
              "More exactly, embodied experience \u2500 or, embodiment \u2500 refers to the living, moving, active body with agency for self-reflection, improvement and healing (martial arts as forms of medicine and healing in themselves), but, for our purposes, not one involving external surgery for aesthetics (for a sharp contrast, see Orbach\u2019s (2008) account of how bodily ideals in global modernity have turned many people to psychotherapy and cosmetic surgery).",

              "In this view, body cultures are always pluralistic, offering multiple possibilities in different spaces and across time.",
              "They can be for performance, health and also cultural expression (and quite often a shifting mix of the three positions).",
              "For instance, over the centuries, fencing has shifted from a battlefield activity and one for duels to the death to a modern Olympic sport.",
              "Yet there has been resistance to the sportisation process and a renaissance of interest in historical fencing and lost styles known as the historical European martial arts (HEMA), which are being researched, re-enacted and revived through the creation of new materials, organisations and events (Jaquet et al.",
              ", 2020).",
              "The techniques and objects are recreated in modern times, which enables us to consider the potential benefits and risks associated with wielding a powerful weapon such as a longsword or a poleaxe.",
              "In addition, two very different inquiries on the pedagogies of two very diverse practices and milieu \u2015Kalarippayattu in South India and Juego de Garrote in Venezuela \u2015 have demonstrated that martial arts can also be adopted for healing purposes to improve practitioners\u2019 self-confidence and feeling of power, which all stems from the preparation, curation and training of the body (Zarrilli, 2000;",
              "Ryan, 2016).",
