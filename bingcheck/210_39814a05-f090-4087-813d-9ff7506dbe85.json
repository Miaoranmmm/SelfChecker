    "query": "What is the most effective way to promote and implement sustainable farming practices, and how can farmers transition from conventional methods to more environmentally-friendly approaches while maintaining profitability?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. Sustainable agriculture is farming in such a way to protect the environment, expand the Earth\u2019s natural resource base, and maintain and improve soil fertility[^1^]. It also seeks to increase profitable farm income, promote environmental stewardship, enhance quality of life for farm families and communities, and increase production for human food and fiber needs[^2^].\n\nThere are many different methods and practices of sustainable agriculture, such as organic, free-range, low-input, holistic, and biodynamic[^3^]. Some of the common techniques include crop rotation, agroforestry, cover crops, mixed cropping, and permaculture[^4^]. These methods aim to mimic natural ecological processes and reduce the use of external inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.\n\nThe transition from conventional to sustainable farming practices can be challenging but also rewarding for farmers. Some of the benefits of sustainable agriculture include improved soil health and fertility, reduced water use and pollution, enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services, increased resilience to climate change and pests, diversified income sources, and access to new markets[^7^]. However, some of the barriers include lack of knowledge and skills, high upfront costs and risks, limited access to credit and insurance, and weak infrastructure and institutions[^8^].\n\nTherefore, to promote and implement sustainable farming practices effectively, farmers need support from various stakeholders such as governments, NGOs, research institutions, extension services, private sector partners, and consumers. Some of the ways to provide this support include:\n\n- Providing education and training on sustainable farming techniques and business skills\n- Offering financial incentives such as subsidies, grants, loans, and insurance\n- Creating market linkages and value chains for sustainable products\n- Developing policies and regulations that encourage and reward sustainable practices\n- Investing in research and innovation to address knowledge gaps and challenges\n- Engaging farmers in participatory decision-making and co-learning processes\n- Building networks and alliances among farmers and other actors\n\nOne example of a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to help smallholder farmers become sustainable is the Better Life Farming (BLF) alliance. It is a partnership between Bayer, a global life science company; the World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corporation (IFC); Netafim, a global supplier of irrigation solutions; and more than 20 local partners at a country level. The alliance offers comprehensive and accessible services to smallholders such as education and training, access to credit and insurance, supplies of seeds, fertilizers, crop protection, irrigation, and farming equipment; as well as market linkages with downstream customers. The alliance also works with capacity-building partners such as Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), NGOs and local farmer organizations[^6^].\n\nI hope this answer has given you some insights into the topic of sustainable agriculture.

Indeed, cover crops (CCs) may regulate several ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, soil fertility, moderation of extreme meteorological events, pollination, and climate and water regulation;",
              "in addition, CCs are also used as forage crops and have considerable effects on plant and soil biodiversity.",
              "However, to achieve the desired effects on agro-ecosystems, cover cropping should be carefully adopted by considering the specie choice, period of cultivation, and termination method based on site, farm, or purpose-specific.",
              "The main objective of this manuscript is to analyze the effects of modern agriculture on soil and environmental health and how cover crops can support sustainable cropping systems and global food security.",
              "In addition, it focuses on how the incorporation of cover crops into conventional cropping systems can help in the diversification of crops and assist in mitigating the environmental effects of cropping systems. Finally, this review thoroughly investigates the potential effects of CCs on environmental sustainability, which can be an important source of information for sustainable crop production and food security.",

              "Key questions in this dimension include: Healthy terrestrial ecosystems are especially important for systems of agricultural production and management.",
              "The importance of biodiversity, including soil biodiversity, for global sustainability was formalized at the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (1).",
              "* Investing in the health of ecosystems and soil through sustainable agriculture can reduce and mitigate the damaging environmental impacts of conventional agriculture, in turn making both ecosystems and farming systems more productive and resilient.",
              "Conventional agricultural practices have contributed to long-term ecological imbalance, degrading land and soil, diminishing habitat and biodiversity, accelerating loss of species, and emitting chemical and nutrient pollution (2).",
              "Healthy and functioning ecosystems, meanwhile, help pollinate crops, manage pests and disease, filter water, and offer additional services that are critical for land-based agriculture.",

              "Conventional agricultural systems and practices have contributed to the widespread degradation of land, soil, and water, alongside degrading other ecosystem services and resources.",
              "Agriculture\u2019s current demands on the world\u2019s land and freshwater resources are unsustainably high.",
              "More than a third of the Earth\u2019s total land area is used for agriculture and grazing, leading to alarming rates of land conversion and loss of species habitat and causing the salination of 20% of global irrigated land by area (1).",
              "Agriculture is responsible for more than half of all nitrogen and phosphorous runoff into oceans, contributing to the \u201cdead zones\u201d\u2014areas where excess nitrogen pollution leads marine life to die\u2014that affect more than 200,000 km2 of ocean and threaten freshwater ecosystems (3).",
              "Grazing lands and grasslands, which cover between 20% and 40% of the Earth\u2019s area, have also faced significant threats, as agricultural conversion in East Africa and South America has led to severe loss of grassland (1).",
              "Deforestation, often done with the purpose of converting land to agricultural use, poses one of the gravest threats to biodiversity, because forests support three-quarters of the world\u2019s terrestrial biodiversity (4).",
              "Soil erosion and depletion are occurring rapidly across the globe, with an estimated 66% of the world\u2019s soils already experiencing degradation and more than 90% facing degradation by 2050 (1).",
              "Researchers estimate that human-induced rates of soil erosion will outpace rates of soil formation by more than an order of magnitude (5).",
              "If current rates of degradation continue, according to the UN, all of the world\u2019s topsoil could be gone within 60 years, making food production increasingly difficult (10).",
              "Dimensions of Impact: WHO Investors interested in deploying this strategy should consider whom they want to target, as almost every strategy has a host of potential beneficiaries.",
              "While some investors may target women of color living in a particular rural area, others may set targets more broadly, e.",
              "g., women.",
              "Investors interested in targeting particular populations should focus on strategies that have been shown to benefit those populations.",
              "Key questions in this dimension include: While investments aligned with this Strategic Goal could positively affect people and planet quite broadly, specific target stakeholders in this Strategic Goal can include the following.",
              "*Rural communities, marginalized communities, and women may specifically benefit from availability of healthier foods and better care of natural resources related to this Strategic Goal \u2013 for further detail, see the \u201cImproving Human Health through Agriculture,\u201d \u201cImproving Social Equity and Justice through Agriculture,\u201d and \u201cIncreasing Gender Equality in Agriculture\u201d Strategic Goals in the IRIS+ Sustainable Agriculture theme.",
              "The targets of these investments are worldwide in nearly every country that participates in the global agricultural economy, both Global North and Global South.",
              "According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, the regions with soils most suitable to support cropping with fewer inputs include parts of North America, Eastern Europe, and East Asia.",
              "The regions at highest risk of land degradation include parts of the Midwestern United States, Brazil, India, China, and Western Europe.",
              "Asia sees the highest use of nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizer, followed by Europe and North America, broadly corresponding with similar trends in excess nitrogen and phosphorous applied to cropland (1).",
              "Dimensions of Impact: CONTRIBUTION Investors considering investing in a company or portfolio aligned with this strategy should consider whether the effect they want to have compares to what is likely to happen anyway.",
              "Is the investment's contribution \u2018likely better\u2019 or \u2018likely worse\u2019 than what is likely to occur anyway across What, How much and Who?",
              "Key questions in this dimension include: Organizations can consider contribution at two levels\u2014enterprise and investor.",

              "Investors can contribute toward addressing the larger issues of the degradation of land, soil, and ecosystem health as follows.",
              "Dimensions of Impact: HOW MUCH Investors deploying capital into investments aligned with this strategy should think about how significant the investment's effect might be.",
              "What is likely to be the change's breadth, depth, and duration?",
              "Key questions in this dimension include: Billions of humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms will benefit from healthy and functioning ecosystems. Indeed, at the 2021 World Economic Forum in Davos, the United Nations Secretary-General presented the world\u2019s current loss of biodiversity as an existential threat to urgently address (13).",
              "As 75% of the world\u2019s poor live in rural areas, sustainable rural development remains the most effective means to reduce poverty, food insecurity, and ecological degradation (4).",
              "Nature will also benefit.",
              "Around one million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, more than ever before in human history, according to the United Nations (12).",
              "More than three-quarters of food crop types rely on animal pollination, and three-quarters of the world\u2019s terrestrial biodiversity rely on forest ecosystems\u2014meaning that animal extinction threats are also often threats to agricultural yields.",
              "Protecting habitats and reducing deforestation thus benefit both biodiversity and food security (4).",
              "The extent of change resulting from investments aligned with this Strategic Goal will depend on the size, scope, and attributes of the land area affected.",
              "Other influencing factors include any co-benefits from environmental rehabilitation and the investment\u2019s length and stability.",
              "However, evidence shows that sustainable farming practices can result in significantly better outcomes for ecosystem health compared to conventional agricultural practices.",
              "For example, the Rodale Farming Systems Trial at a trial farm in Pennsylvania in the eastern United States\u2014the longest-running side-by-side comparison of organic and conventional farming systems to date\u2014has shown that, over 22 years, carbon increased by 15\u201328% in soils managed with organic techniques compared to a 9% increase in conventionally managed soils (6).",
              "CGIAR researchers found evidence that the success of using a holistic ecosystem approach to securing land and water resources through sustainable land management mitigated rates of erosion and sediment deposits in the Upper Tana River Basin in Kenya (11).",
              "Dimensions of Impact: RISK Key questions in this dimension include: Impact risk factors for investments to improve ecosystem health include the following.",
              "These risks may lead to financial losses for both investor and investee.",
              "Loss of agricultural production due to external risks or loss of a project\u2019s environmental or sustainability certifications present salient and immediate risks for investors.",
              "Poor management of an investment can also tarnish an investor\u2019s reputation and credibility.",
              "External risks associated with environmental events or human-influenced environmental conditions may cause financial or physical damage to farms and agricultural businesses, leading to investor losses or delayed payback periods.",
              "Meanwhile, evidence risks associated with data collection and reporting may lead to inaccurate or misleading outcomes.",
              "Since 2009, RSF Social Finance has supported the growth of Guayaki, a yerba mate\u2013based beverage company that sources the herb for its tea from smallholder, organic farmers in South America.",
              "Guayaki exclusively sources shade-grown yerba mate at a premium, which has encouraged farmers to reforest their land with native hardwoods to resemble the plant\u2019s natural growing environment.",
              "Starting with a USD 500,000 investment, in 2011 RSF Social Finance offered a USD 1.",
              "9 million working capital line of credit to fill a gap in cash flow between inventory purchases and the sale of goods.",
              "RSF Social Finance subsequently increased this amount year on year to support the growing social enterprise, including a USD 10 million financial package to build a centralized processing and drying facility in Brazil (14).",
              "As of 2019, Guyaki stewards 174,000 acres of Atlantic Rainforest, provides USD 141 million in ecosystem services, monitors more than 400 species of flora and fauna in cultivated forests, has conserved 925 billion liters of water in the soil on 383,500 acres of agroforestry, and has contributed to the economic sovereignty of 1,190 Indigenous and smallholder family members producing yerba mate (15).",
              "Quantified Ventures and ReHarvest Partners manage the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund, which provides financial incentives to farmers to implement conservation agriculture practices that improve water and soil quality.",
              "The Fund uses an outcome-based model that verifies results independently with a third-party partner, the outcomes verification firm Sustainable Environmental Consultants.",
              "Targeting the Midwest United States, the fund operates across tens of thousands of cropland acreage in Iowa, Illinois, and Ohio.",
              "Their annual reporting of environmental outcomes includes 170,000 pounds of nitrogen and 14,250 pounds of phosphorous reduced in 2019 (9).",

              "The \u201cRidge to Valley\u201d program installed sediment traps and ponds high in the watershed near the \u201cridge\u201d and progressively rolled out measures to the \u201cvalley\u201d bottom.",
              "In addition to infrastructure improvements, the project also funded tree planting and efficient irrigation systems, such as drip irrigation.",
              "This work to develop the watershed has helped slow the flow of water, reduce soil erosion, and increase groundwater levels.",
              "The IWMP nearly doubled groundwater availability to 14 meters from 8 meters, increased water storage capacity, and increased overall irrigation access for farmers, who have reported increased agricultural productivity and improved quality of life.",
              "After the watershed improvements, households\u2019 average per capita income increased by 235% over five years, and farmers who were previously able to irrigate just 10\u201320% of their land reported being able to irrigate all of their fields (16).",

              "Three kinds of incentives (market and non-market, regulations and cross-compliance, Box 1), as well as their compulsory or voluntary nature, are assessed to determine whether the type of the incentive affects farmers\u2019 willingness to adopt.",

              "6).",
              "One of the general strengths of market-based incentives is that they offer flexible adoption to promote specific behaviour changes.",
              "Examples of this include altering market prices, setting a cap or altering quantities of a particular good, improving the way a market works, or creating a market where none previously existed (for example, water trading)20.",
              "However, one of the weaknesses of market-based incentives and their flexibility is that they can lead to negative social, environmental and economic changes that were unplanned or not in line with the intended strategic direction10.",
              "For example, subsidies may increase the adoption of intercropping and residue mulching, but these practices may crowd out adoption of zero tillage21.",
              "However, a lack of flexibility has been linked to low adoption levels as farmers\u2019 previous experiences of using a particular agricultural practice may significantly influence the types of policy instrument they will apply5.",
              "For example, promoting the use of specific crops for the incorporation of nutrients into the soil is more likely to be adopted by farmers who already practice crop rotation21,22,23.",
              "This is particularly pertinent for non-market incentives, for which it is important to understand the interaction between a particular practice and the policy instruments designed to achieve its uptake.",
              "Some studies show that instruments perceived as inflexible or too complex, such as legal regulations, were the least preferred by farmers5.",
              "Indeed, for regulatory measures, such as forest laws or watershed management programmes, the adoption of practices depends on the effectiveness of law enforcement, supervision and monitoring.",
              "For this reason, the adoption of regulatory measures is often linked to accompanying measures such as information sharing, capacity building, technical assistance, training support for the local population and farmer-to-farmer communication networks that build trust and enhance understanding of the potential benefits of conservation practices24.",
              "Agricultural extension services, both public and private, have been shown to have a positive impact on adoption rates5,7,12,15,23,25,26,27,28.",
              "Connecting these programmes with national extension systems can result in a significant change in agricultural sustainability.",
              "To increase their effectiveness, regulatory measures are often linked to economic incentives including forest trade quotas, certification, access to rural credits or benefits in insurance markets.",
              "For example, voluntary community-based programmes are often coupled with short-term financial support to incentivize participation25,29.",
              "To improve efficiency in the adoption of the promoted practices, flexible payments may be preferred as participation costs and expected benefits differ depending on individual farmers and geographical location16.",
              "Cross-compliance incentives help overcome the barriers that make the adoption of sustainable practices unattractive, such as large up-front adoption costs, lack of capital, restricted access to financial markets and the need to provide for the household\u2019s short-term economic needs.",
              "They are based on the hypothesis that incentives should at least compensate for the income loss or additional costs of adopting sustainable practices;",
              "and that there should be clear monitoring processes that ensure compliance with the conditionality (the adoption of the sustainable practice).",
              "The main cross-compliance incentives are PES or agri-environment payments.",
              "These are incentives offered to farmers, or landowners, in exchange for managing their land to provide some type of ecological service, including water quality, forestry, soil erosion and air pollution.",
              "In the case of resource conservation in the Ecuadorian Andes, it was shown that when conservation technologies were offered in conjunction with measures that enhance the short-term profitability of agriculture (such as new crops, biological barriers and improved agricultural production), the adoption of conservation practices increased significantly8.",
              "Similar results were found in the Nepal Knowledge Based Integrated Sustainable Agriculture and Nutrition (KISAN) project30.",
              "These two examples reflect the broader finding that in most of the reported PES case studies, socioeconomic and environmental outcomes have been positive8,15,30, especially if the PES is accompanied by technical assistance7,12.",
              "The decision by farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices in response to incentive programmes is not a binary process.",
              "Adoption is a continuum that depends on many factors: the conditions of the programme, the incentives offered, the environmental preferences, personal perspectives, experience and education of farmers4.",
              "Farmers\u2019 decisions are shaped by personal opinions, such as preferences over conservation measures, beliefs about the programme and degrees of risk aversion21,31.",
              "Factors such as income levels, asset ownership, age, and access to other economic opportunities also correlate with the decision to adopt, as they affect the capacity of the target population to reap benefits from the programme5,6,7,12,29,32,33,34.",
              "The decision to adopt is also affected by the biophysical characteristics of the land plot, and the institutional and policy context.",
              "Even agricultural market trends affect producers\u2019 decisions to adopt agricultural practices3,6.",
              "The variety of factors that contribute to the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices necessitates the consideration of context in policy design and the use of differentiated policy instruments16.",
              "Direct economic benefits, increased productivity or profitability seem to be the essential condition for the adoption of sustainable practices in the short term7.",
              "Regardless of the incentive type, adoption rates are higher when programmes offer short-term economic benefits than those solely aimed at providing a positive ecological outcome.",
              "For example, restrictive land-use-change programmes, such as those induced by climate change, which modify the incentives for engaging in agricultural production, agroforestry and other land uses have higher adoption rates when they are connected with an improvement in income13,15.",
              "Nevertheless, and independent of the incentive type, in the long term it seems that one of the strongest motivations for farmers to adopt and maintain sustainable practices is the perceived positive outcomes of these practices for their farm or the environment8,9,10,11.",
              "For example, the greatest motivating factor for participation in a forest conservation scheme in Kenya was the \u2018will to conserve\u2019, influenced by the local communities\u2019 concern for the degradation of their environment and their perceived dependency on natural resources11.",
              "The will to participate was based on the perceived benefits of conservation, especially changes in water availability, which were reinforced by the potential benefits of new income-generating activities.",
              "This suggests that incentives can lead to the adoption of sustainable practices and have positive effects on ecological services, even without direct payments.",
              "If participants perceive future benefits of sustainable practices, the likelihood of adoption increases15,29.",
              "The likelihood of a farmer adopting the associated sustainable agricultural practice depends on whether the incentive is compulsory or voluntary5.",
              "Voluntary incentive programmes, such as market and non-market-based incentives or certification schemes (for example, carbon footprints, water footprints, organic farming), have a high degree of uncertainty as they depend on the decision of farmers to adopt sustainable practices.",
              "In general, if the economic incentives or payment levels do not offset the costs of adoption (cover opportunity costs of changing production techniques or for the most productive land uses), farmers will rarely switch to the desired practices.",
              "However, if payment levels compensate, or overcompensate, for income losses and additional costs, then the willingness of farmers to adopt is normally high.",
              "In contrast, the uptake of sustainable agricultural practices due to compulsory incentives is fairly certain.",
              "Regulatory measures, such as legal regulations, reduce uncertainty by imposing sanctions for non-compliance.",
              "The adoption of regulatory measures depends on the effectiveness of law enforcement, supervision and monitoring;",
              "however, if institutions are able to enforce the sanctions, the uncertainty surrounding adoption is low or non-existent28.",
              "The degree of uncertainty in the adoption of sustainable practices is closely linked to contradictions between the preferences of farmers and society.",
              "Farmers may prefer the short-term financial support and flexibility offered by voluntary incentive programmes, which, being voluntary, tend to create more uncertainty in the achievement of the programme\u2019s environmental goals.",
              "This can conflict with society\u2019s preference for longer-term instruments, such as legal regulations, which tend to reduce uncertainty in the achievement of outcomes.",
              "Throughout all stages in the incentive\u2013adoption\u2013outcome chain, wider contextual factors play an important role.",
              "Ignorance of the practices promoted and the opportunity costs from foregone activities due to limitations on land use and restrictions on the use of some management practices may deter participation by some farmers16,29,35.",
              "Complexity, inflexibility and complicated procedures are also salient obstacles for participation5,15,16.",

              "Within this, there are a multitude of factors that determine the perceived and actual costs and benefits, both direct and indirect, of adopting sustainable practices.",
              "The attributes of the programme determine the likelihood of adoption, which is influenced by the perception of an improvement in net benefit and access to alternative markets.",
              "In some cases, positive outcomes\u2014such as increases in yields\u2014may not be enough to compensate for the higher input and capital requirements of the proposed agricultural interventions36.",
              "Therefore, economic incentives are necessary and need to be large enough to compensate for the opportunity cost of change, taking into consideration that the effects on outcomes take time to realize.",

              "In the case of productivity, there may actually be negative consequences in the short run.",
              "Therefore, the link between adoption and outcome requires consideration of the time horizon.",

              "Indeed, several papers in this scoping review point out the potential for conflict associated with equity and efficiency13,29, a subset of which suggested that the environmental efficiency of these approaches should justify their adoption in certain instances.",
              "In general, the alignment of equity and efficiency will occur only if the geographical location of the programme overlaps with the location of poor farmers.",
              "An alternative approach is to target incentive programmes at the lands most vulnerable to land-use change or farmers more reluctant to adopt sustainable practices to promote additionality.",
              "Additionality measures the net result from an intervention and is defined as the product of environmental service provision (for example, hydrological services, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and landscape beauty services) and deforestation probability, resulting from an PES22.",
              "The question therefore is if and when incentive programmes are necessary to encourage adoption.",
              "Farmers who are more likely to adopt incentive programmes are often located in regions in which deforestation risks are lower, have stronger preferences for conservation programmes, the opportunity costs from adopting sustainable practices are lower, or the net benefits of adoption are high regardless of the economic incentives.",
              "Hence, the incentives might not be the real driver for adopting sustainable practices, and adopters might participate in the programme regardless of the incentives.",
              "Incentive programmes should therefore target vulnerable areas to ensure additionality of the programme and the most effective use of resources.",
              "Furthermore, the measure of outcomes should account for the trade-offs among different types of incentives\u2014or how different incentive types could complement one another to achieve the desired outcomes.",

              "These are based on the most solid evidence found on the effectiveness of incentives to motivate the adoption of sustainable practices that, in turn, led to better indicators of productivity, profitability and environmental sustainability of farms under different production systems and conditional factors.",
              "Incentives must be high enough to motivate a change in production practices.",
              "This is because productivity and profitability gains can be insufficient to compensate for the total cost of the initial capital requirements and any unexpected costs of the proposed agricultural interventions.",
              "The likelihood of farmers adopting sustainable agricultural practices will vary depending on their experience, education, access to information and level of risk-aversion.",
              "Policymakers must be familiar with the farmers, and tailor the incentive programmes for them by incorporating the range of personal, political, institutional and biophysical factors into the design of the programme.",
              "Instruments should be simple to understand and communicate given that farmers dislike instruments that are too complex (such as some legal regulations) and are therefore less likely to adopt them.",
              "Besides, complexity makes instruments harder to communicate and more expensive to adopt or enforce.",
              "Single interventions are less likely to succeed, hence the need to use a combination of policy instruments.",
              "For example, the provision of technical assistance and extension services contributes to the understanding of farmers and helps them adopt proposed practices.",
              "Given that people have a tendency to follow the behaviour of others, farmers\u2019 preferences should be taken into account when designing incentives, acknowledging that they vary depending on the target population.",
              "The time horizon depends on the agricultural practice, the production system and the biological cycle.",
              "This means the opportunity cost of time has to be considered and financial tools have to be put in place so that cash flow problems do not jeopardize the intervention.",
              "Incentives that make the adoption of sustainable practices attractive depend heavily on an enabling economic and financial environment.",
              "Beyond incentives, it is necessary to improve the general conditions that influence agricultural systems. There are many factors that influence the capacity and willingness of farmers to invest in land, water and forest conservation and to pursue sustainable practices such as agricultural institutions, policies and regulations, social protection, infrastructure and markets, prices, off-farm employment opportunities and structural poverty.",
              "Incentive programmes need to be well targeted, effective and efficient while taking into account spatial differences, differences in economic activities and types and the number of economic, social and environmental outcomes pursued, as well as budget limitations.",
              "The design of such programmes, which are also flexible, simple to implement and cost effective, is not an easy task and requires a collective effort and good data.",

              "This is a condition for the estimation of environmental services such as biodiversity, carbon services (that require information on the amount of stored carbon before and after an adopted practice) or hydrological services (that require information on site-specific soil characteristics, vegetation cover, slope, distribution and intensity of precipitation).",
              "Similarly, the quality and availability of data are frequently inadequate for more precise measures of the cost of participation in incentive programmes.",
              "Beyond the specific incentives examined in this scoping review, it is still necessary to improve the general conditions influencing agricultural systems and practices for sustainable outcomes of the whole sector (Box 3).",
              "Agricultural institutions, policies and regulations, social protection, infrastructure and markets, relative prices, off-farm employment opportunities, structural poverty and the scarcity of asset endowments all influence the capacity and willingness of farmers to invest in land, water and forest conservation and to pursue sustainable practices.",

              "To this end, this scoping review examines the evidence of nearly 18,000 papers on whether incentive-based programmes lead to the adoption of sustainable practices and their effect on environmental, economic and productivity outcomes.",

              "Among other things, this involves rotating crops and embracing diversity, planting cover crops, no-till systems (or reduced till), integrated pest management, integration between livestock and crops, agroforestry practices and precision farming.",
              "The general aim of sustainable agricultural policies is that they ensure environmental sustainability while enhancing, or at least maintaining, farm productivity.",
              "At present, competing uses for land and water resources contribute to the degradation of natural resource capital, a situation that may exacerbate present-day and intergenerational consequences for farmers, other users and the wider population.",

              "Therefore, their adoption may have significant benefits for the environment.",
              "Moreover, the adoption of sustainable practices is likely to help achieve more resilient and productive food systems and enable sustainable production, which would serve to reduce poverty and advance food security2,3.",
              "Sustainable agriculture therefore has the potential to directly contribute to several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030, including those relating to poverty (SDG 1), hunger (SDG 2), decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), reducing inequalities (SDG 9), responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), climate action (SDG 13), life below water (SDG 14) and life on land (SDG 15).",
              "The adoption of these sustainable practices usually requires concrete incentives, significant effort from farmers and the support of governments and public\u2013private partnerships at national and local levels.",
              "However, the decision to adopt sustainable agricultural practices in response to incentive programmes is not a binary process.",
              "Adoption depends on many factors: the conditions of the programme and the incentives offered, as well as the farmers\u2019 environmental preferences, economics and cultural characteristics4,5.",

              "This scoping review is thus motivated by the need to systematically evaluate the evidence base 6 the effects of incentives offered to farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices.",
              "To this end, this scoping review examines nearly 18,000 papers on the various incentives that are offered to farmers by governments, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, development banks and other market actors such as consumers and enterprises.",
              "Three kinds of incentives (market and non-market, regulations and cross-compliance, Box 1), as well as their compulsory or voluntary nature, are assessed to determine whether the type of the incentive affects farmers\u2019 willingness to adopt.",
              "This scoping review also examines the relationship between farmer\u2019s adoption of sustainable practices and three types of outcomes: environmental, productivity and economic.",
              "Finally, the scoping review draws conclusions on the effectiveness of incentives and the adoption of sustainable farming practices to achieve the desired outcomes.",
              "These incentive\u2013adoption\u2013outcome pillars, and the links between them, offer a consistent logic by which to evaluate best practices in sustainable agricultural policy.",
              "This scoping review also considers the broader demographic, social, environmental and economic factors that may drive the observed linkages between incentive, adoption and outcome.",
              "This scoping review finds that regardless of the incentive type, linking programmes to economic benefits (productivity or profitability) is essential for farmers to adopt sustainable agriculture practices in the short term6,7.",
              "In the long term, one of the strongest motivations for farmers to adopt and maintain sustainable practices is perceived positive outcomes of adoption for their farm or the environment8,9,10,11.",
              "Beyond this, there are important analysis gaps in the existing literature, particularly regarding the interrelationships between the selected incentives, the adoption of best agricultural practices and outcomes.",
              "Some suggestions on the next lines of research are included in the analysis.",
              "Incentives are instruments used by the public and private sectors to encourage farmers to protect or enhance ecosystem services beneficial to them and others (for example, water quality, soil care, forestry), while simultaneously improving the productivity (yields, labour per hectare and so on) and the competitiveness (such as cost per hectare, profitability, farm incomes) of the agricultural sector.",
              "These were classified into three categories.",
              "Market-based incentives encourage behavioural change by providing economic incentives through market signals.",
              "Examples of these include prices of input and output, subsidy, compensation, income transfer and other incentives in cash or in kind to agricultural producers.",
              "Non-market incentives are a broad basket.",
              "The parties of the Paris Agreement expressed that a non-market-based mechanism can be anything, provided it is not market-based51.",
              "This includes technical support, technology transfer and fiscal measures, such as putting a price on carbon or applying taxes to improve environmental sustainability.",
              "Regulatory measures are general rules or specific actions imposed by government agencies or private entities to enhance environmental and economic outcomes through improved practices.",

              "Cross-compliance incentives link direct payments to farmers\u2019 compliance with basic standards concerning the environment.",

              "In this case, they are mostly voluntary.",
              "Examples of these include government subsidies that are conditional on farmers adhering to certain environmental practices.",
              "The purpose of this scoping review is to understand how incentives motivate the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices and, ultimately, how and whether they result in measurable outcomes.",
              "This scoping review looked at the overall landscape of evidence of these instruments and their effectiveness in achieving the key outcomes.",
              "As in any scoping review, article screening against the inclusion and exclusion criteria took place in three phases: title screening, abstract screening and full-text screening (Box 2).",
              "This resulted in 577 articles that were evaluated for relevance in terms of connecting either incentives to adoption, adoption to measurable outcomes or both sets of links.",
              "A machine learning-based approach helped to identify and cluster common terms and topics covered by the three incentive types (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "Programmes fell into three broad categories related to ecosystem and environmental interventions, socioeconomic interventions and technological solutions.",
              "Articles typically showcased multiple interventions, with 36% of the total programmes falling under the technical category, and 32% each falling under the ecosystem and socioeconomic categories.",
              "All programmes that appeared in more than 20 of the 577 articles are included.",
              "Note that the machine learning approach used to tag the articles by topic distinguished terms as used in the articles.",
              "To better understand the links between incentive, adoption and outcome, a stratified random sample of 99 citations were selected from the 577 articles for additional review and data extraction.",
              "Of these, six articles were excluded as they were published in a language not spoken by any of the authors of this research or because full-text versions could not be located.",
              "The subset of 93 articles facilitated more in-depth review of the incentive types.",
              "Each article contained a link between either incentives and adoption or adoption and outcomes, or both.",
              "For each article, the incentive types were identified, farmers\u2019 adoption behaviours as described in the articles were recorded and the corresponding outcomes were noted as a function of the incentives.",
              "We found that market and non-market incentives tend to be the most prevalent mechanism (Fig.",
              "2), whereas all three incentive categories are used more or less uniformly to achieve environmental outcomes.",
              "Furthermore, profitability-related outcomes tend to require balanced incentive structures, whereas productivity-related outcomes tend to be more market and non-market-oriented (Fig.",
              "2).",
              "The links are from the subset of 93 articles, colour-coded by outcome.",
              "Given the importance of understanding when and how incentives drive farmers\u2019 adoption behaviours and how the adoption of specific practices leads to the desired outcomes, additional analysis was needed.",
              "We further limited the subset of papers to only those that had a complete set of links between the incentive\u2013adoption\u2013outcome pillars (44 papers) (Supplementary Annex 1).",
              "The results of this exercise illustrate how many of the papers with the full logic actually addressed multiple incentive categories and outcomes (Fig.",
              "3).",
              "This is an important finding, as it bolsters the earlier observation that multipronged, integrated development interventions, both in terms of incentive structure and expected outcomes, are relatively commonplace.",
              "It is also important to note that although environmental and profitability outcomes are more or less equally supported by all three incentives, profitability outcomes are more supported by market or non-market incentives.",
              "The 44 full-text reviews are included (read from left to right).",
              "See Supplementary Annex 1 for the associated list of papers.",
              "There is a clear general association between market and non-market incentives and environmental outcomes (Fig.",
              "3).",
              "Nearly half of the interventions seen in the full-text review are considering market or non-market incentives and, simultaneously, just over 40% of the outcomes had an explicit environmental focus (Fig.",
              "4).",
              "In general terms, this illustrates that, given appropriate design, market/non-market incentives can be successfully paired with environmental outcomes.",
              "Similarly important, it is clear that regulatory-based incentives are either less adequately documented or generally less prevalent in the development community\u2019s menu of incentive-based approaches (left side of Fig.",
              "4).",
              "Combined with the previous figures linking incentives to multiple outcome types (Figs.",
              "2 and 3), there is support for the idea that development interventions tend to be moving away from simple productivity-enhancing approaches towards a more holistic style of engagement (Fig.",

              "Furthermore, evidence for incentive\u2013outcome relationships is unequally distributed, in terms of the quality and quantity of available evidence, across both the incentive and outcome types (Fig.",

              "This evidence analysis suggests that there is a robust evidence base for environmental outcomes associated with cross-compliance incentives.",

              "2 and 3).",
              "Given the general emphasis on cross-compliance and market/non-market approaches, perhaps more attention is needed to examine the scope and efficacy of regulatory approaches.",
              "The available evidence allows us to make some standardized conclusions about the effectiveness of incentives for the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, and the associated productivity and economic outcomes.",
              "However, there is little or no evidence on environmental outcomes, as most of the evidence on this respect is qualitative.",
              "Most papers only made an approximation of changes towards improvements in agricultural practices and environmental outcomes through qualitative assessment of farmer\u2019s perceptions.",

              "The results are only measurable through the improvements in the productivity and profitability of producers9.",
              "For measuring potential environmental outcomes, some papers compare adoption rates of farmers receiving incentives versus non-receiving farmers8,9,12,14 or relate socioeconomic characteristics of participants versus non-participants8,15.",
              "Most papers simply state the participation rates in terms of the percentage of potential beneficiaries and explain them using influencing factors.",
              "Some papers model the adoption according to different incentive levels (such as different tax or levels of payments for environmental services (PES))10,16,17,18,19.",
              "In those articles, no complete evidence was found connecting incentives with adoption and outcomes.",
              "Stronger identification strategies are also needed to uncover the causal effect of the chain of incentives, adoption and outcomes.",
              "We found no randomized controlled trial studies in the selected papers, which constitutes an important gap in the literature as these kinds of experiments are key to more accurately testing the effectiveness of policy interventions, technologies and practices, taking into account socioeconomic, geographical and environmental influential factors.",
              "This scoping review reveals important research gaps: methods to detect causal pathways and to quantify the connections.",
              "However, despite weaknesses and limitations in the evidence base, the evidence provided by previous programmes on what has worked and what needs to be improved is important to consider when designing future incentive programmes.",
              "Looking at the articles reviewed in this scoping review, some interesting aspects for each of the three incentive categories can be highlighted (Fig.",
              "6).",
              "One of the general strengths of market-based incentives is that they offer flexible adoption to promote specific behaviour changes.",
              "Examples of this include altering market prices, setting a cap or altering quantities of a particular good, improving the way a market works, or creating a market where none previously existed (for example, water trading)20.",
              "However, one of the weaknesses of market-based incentives and their flexibility is that they can lead to negative social, environmental and economic changes that were unplanned or not in line with the intended strategic direction10.",
              "For example, subsidies may increase the adoption of intercropping and residue mulching, but these practices may crowd out adoption of zero tillage21.",
              "However, a lack of flexibility has been linked to low adoption levels as farmers\u2019 previous experiences of using a particular agricultural practice may significantly influence the types of policy instrument they will apply5.",
              "For example, promoting the use of specific crops for the incorporation of nutrients into the soil is more likely to be adopted by farmers who already practice crop rotation21,22,23.",
              "This is particularly pertinent for non-market incentives, for which it is important to understand the interaction between a particular practice and the policy instruments designed to achieve its uptake.",
              "Some studies show that instruments perceived as inflexible or too complex, such as legal regulations, were the least preferred by farmers5.",
              "Indeed, for regulatory measures, such as forest laws or watershed management programmes, the adoption of practices depends on the effectiveness of law enforcement, supervision and monitoring.",
              "For this reason, the adoption of regulatory measures is often linked to accompanying measures such as information sharing, capacity building, technical assistance, training support for the local population and farmer-to-farmer communication networks that build trust and enhance understanding of the potential benefits of conservation practices24.",
              "Agricultural extension services, both public and private, have been shown to have a positive impact on adoption rates5,7,12,15,23,25,26,27,28.",
              "Connecting these programmes with national extension systems can result in a significant change in agricultural sustainability.",
              "To increase their effectiveness, regulatory measures are often linked to economic incentives including forest trade quotas, certification, access to rural credits or benefits in insurance markets.",
              "For example, voluntary community-based programmes are often coupled with short-term financial support to incentivize participation25,29.",
              "To improve efficiency in the adoption of the promoted practices, flexible payments may be preferred as participation costs and expected benefits differ depending on individual farmers and geographical location16.",
              "Cross-compliance incentives help overcome the barriers that make the adoption of sustainable practices unattractive, such as large up-front adoption costs, lack of capital, restricted access to financial markets and the need to provide for the household\u2019s short-term economic needs.",
              "They are based on the hypothesis that incentives should at least compensate for the income loss or additional costs of adopting sustainable practices;",
              "and that there should be clear monitoring processes that ensure compliance with the conditionality (the adoption of the sustainable practice).",
              "The main cross-compliance incentives are PES or agri-environment payments.",
              "These are incentives offered to farmers, or landowners, in exchange for managing their land to provide some type of ecological service, including water quality, forestry, soil erosion and air pollution.",
              "In the case of resource conservation in the Ecuadorian Andes, it was shown that when conservation technologies were offered in conjunction with measures that enhance the short-term profitability of agriculture (such as new crops, biological barriers and improved agricultural production), the adoption of conservation practices increased significantly8.",
              "Similar results were found in the Nepal Knowledge Based Integrated Sustainable Agriculture and Nutrition (KISAN) project30.",
              "These two examples reflect the broader finding that in most of the reported PES case studies, socioeconomic and environmental outcomes have been positive8,15,30, especially if the PES is accompanied by technical assistance7,12.",
              "The decision by farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices in response to incentive programmes is not a binary process.",
              "Adoption is a continuum that depends on many factors: the conditions of the programme, the incentives offered, the environmental preferences, personal perspectives, experience and education of farmers4.",
              "Farmers\u2019 decisions are shaped by personal opinions, such as preferences over conservation measures, beliefs about the programme and degrees of risk aversion21,31.",
              "Factors such as income levels, asset ownership, age, and access to other economic opportunities also correlate with the decision to adopt, as they affect the capacity of the target population to reap benefits from the programme5,6,7,12,29,32,33,34.",
              "The decision to adopt is also affected by the biophysical characteristics of the land plot, and the institutional and policy context.",

              "Regardless of the incentive type, adoption rates are higher when programmes offer short-term economic benefits than those solely aimed at providing a positive ecological outcome.",
              "For example, restrictive land-use-change programmes, such as those induced by climate change, which modify the incentives for engaging in agricultural production, agroforestry and other land uses have higher adoption rates when they are connected with an improvement in income13,15.",
              "Nevertheless, and independent of the incentive type, in the long term it seems that one of the strongest motivations for farmers to adopt and maintain sustainable practices is the perceived positive outcomes of these practices for their farm or the environment8,9,10,11.",
              "For example, the greatest motivating factor for participation in a forest conservation scheme in Kenya was the \u2018will to conserve\u2019, influenced by the local communities\u2019 concern for the degradation of their environment and their perceived dependency on natural resources11.",
              "The will to participate was based on the perceived benefits of conservation, especially changes in water availability, which were reinforced by the potential benefits of new income-generating activities.",
              "This suggests that incentives can lead to the adoption of sustainable practices and have positive effects on ecological services, even without direct payments.",
              "If participants perceive future benefits of sustainable practices, the likelihood of adoption increases15,29.",
              "The likelihood of a farmer adopting the associated sustainable agricultural practice depends on whether the incentive is compulsory or voluntary5.",
              "Voluntary incentive programmes, such as market and non-market-based incentives or certification schemes (for example, carbon footprints, water footprints, organic farming), have a high degree of uncertainty as they depend on the decision of farmers to adopt sustainable practices.",
              "In general, if the economic incentives or payment levels do not offset the costs of adoption (cover opportunity costs of changing production techniques or for the most productive land uses), farmers will rarely switch to the desired practices.",
              "However, if payment levels compensate, or overcompensate, for income losses and additional costs, then the willingness of farmers to adopt is normally high.",

              "In the case of productivity, there may actually be negative consequences in the short run.",
              "Therefore, the link between adoption and outcome requires consideration of the time horizon.",

              "The availability of technical support or other complementary practices is particularly pertinent to regulatory incentives, for which a key criticism is their complexity.",

              "In designing sustainable agricultural policy, it may be necessary to prioritize and make trade-offs between different environmental objectives.",
              "For example, quantity-based market-based incentives (MBIs) such as water trading may reallocate water to \u2018high-value\u2019 users, such as mining, manufacturing and electricity production from \u2018low-value\u2019 users, such as agricultural producers25.",
              "As some high-value users produce high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, achieving the goals for water use may come at a cost for the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",
              "In such cases, an additional measure, such as a regulatory mechanism, may be put in place to minimize the potential trade-off17.",
              "The design of sustainable agricultural policies, and their incentives, therefore requires a broad assessment and consideration of the potential outcomes, and their consequences.",
              "In some cases, trade-offs in socioeconomic and environmental outcomes may be required, as effectively attaining environmental outcomes may deepen economic inequality.",
              "The evidence shows that targeting wealthier landowners can produce greater impacts on environmental outcomes29.",
              "Wealthier landowners may be able to have a higher impact on environmental outcomes than poorer farmers who face much higher opportunity costs from adopting sustainable practices, chief among them subsistence production.",
              "If programmes are targeted at regions with higher wealth and environmental degradation to maximize the achievement of environmental goals, it is likely that a larger percentage of wealthier owners will enrol in the programme and the poorest ones will be excluded.",
              "If financial incentives are provided, the income of the wealthier landowners will further increase, enhancing income disparities.",
              "Consequently, it may not always be possible to simultaneously achieve different environmental and equity development goals with the same policy tool.",
              "Indeed, several papers in this scoping review point out the potential for conflict associated with equity and efficiency13,29, a subset of which suggested that the environmental efficiency of these approaches should justify their adoption in certain instances.",
              "In general, the alignment of equity and efficiency will occur only if the geographical location of the programme overlaps with the location of poor farmers.",
              "An alternative approach is to target incentive programmes at the lands most vulnerable to land-use change or farmers more reluctant to adopt sustainable practices to promote additionality.",
              "Additionality measures the net result from an intervention and is defined as the product of environmental service provision (for example, hydrological services, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and landscape beauty services) and deforestation probability, resulting from an PES22.",
              "The question therefore is if and when incentive programmes are necessary to encourage adoption.",
              "Farmers who are more likely to adopt incentive programmes are often located in regions in which deforestation risks are lower, have stronger preferences for conservation programmes, the opportunity costs from adopting sustainable practices are lower, or the net benefits of adoption are high regardless of the economic incentives.",
              "Hence, the incentives might not be the real driver for adopting sustainable practices, and adopters might participate in the programme regardless of the incentives.",
              "Incentive programmes should therefore target vulnerable areas to ensure additionality of the programme and the most effective use of resources.",
              "Furthermore, the measure of outcomes should account for the trade-offs among different types of incentives\u2014or how different incentive types could complement one another to achieve the desired outcomes.",
              "Indeed, multipronged programmes that incorporate social, economic and productivity components are more likely to succeed in developing countries.",

              "These are based on the most solid evidence found on the effectiveness of incentives to motivate the adoption of sustainable practices that, in turn, led to better indicators of productivity, profitability and environmental sustainability of farms under different production systems and conditional factors.",
              "Incentives must be high enough to motivate a change in production practices.",
              "This is because productivity and profitability gains can be insufficient to compensate for the total cost of the initial capital requirements and any unexpected costs of the proposed agricultural interventions.",
              "The likelihood of farmers adopting sustainable agricultural practices will vary depending on their experience, education, access to information and level of risk-aversion.",
              "Policymakers must be familiar with the farmers, and tailor the incentive programmes for them by incorporating the range of personal, political, institutional and biophysical factors into the design of the programme.",
              "Instruments should be simple to understand and communicate given that farmers dislike instruments that are too complex (such as some legal regulations) and are therefore less likely to adopt them.",
              "Besides, complexity makes instruments harder to communicate and more expensive to adopt or enforce.",
              "Single interventions are less likely to succeed, hence the need to use a combination of policy instruments.",
              "For example, the provision of technical assistance and extension services contributes to the understanding of farmers and helps them adopt proposed practices.",
              "Given that people have a tendency to follow the behaviour of others, farmers\u2019 preferences should be taken into account when designing incentives, acknowledging that they vary depending on the target population.",
              "The time horizon depends on the agricultural practice, the production system and the biological cycle.",
              "This means the opportunity cost of time has to be considered and financial tools have to be put in place so that cash flow problems do not jeopardize the intervention.",
              "Incentives that make the adoption of sustainable practices attractive depend heavily on an enabling economic and financial environment.",
              "Beyond incentives, it is necessary to improve the general conditions that influence agricultural systems. There are many factors that influence the capacity and willingness of farmers to invest in land, water and forest conservation and to pursue sustainable practices such as agricultural institutions, policies and regulations, social protection, infrastructure and markets, prices, off-farm employment opportunities and structural poverty.",
              "Incentive programmes need to be well targeted, effective and efficient while taking into account spatial differences, differences in economic activities and types and the number of economic, social and environmental outcomes pursued, as well as budget limitations.",
              "The design of such programmes, which are also flexible, simple to implement and cost effective, is not an easy task and requires a collective effort and good data.",
              "A challenge for the future is to reduce the cost and allocate more resources to the collection of detailed data.",
              "This is a condition for the estimation of environmental services such as biodiversity, carbon services (that require information on the amount of stored carbon before and after an adopted practice) or hydrological services (that require information on site-specific soil characteristics, vegetation cover, slope, distribution and intensity of precipitation).",
              "Similarly, the quality and availability of data are frequently inadequate for more precise measures of the cost of participation in incentive programmes.",
              "Beyond the specific incentives examined in this scoping review, it is still necessary to improve the general conditions influencing agricultural systems and practices for sustainable outcomes of the whole sector (Box 3).",
              "Agricultural institutions, policies and regulations, social protection, infrastructure and markets, relative prices, off-farm employment opportunities, structural poverty and the scarcity of asset endowments all influence the capacity and willingness of farmers to invest in land, water and forest conservation and to pursue sustainable practices.",
