    "query": "How has the portrayal of mental health issues in popular media evolved over the past decade, and what impact has this had on public perception and awareness of mental health?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. The portrayal of mental health issues in popular media has evolved over the past decade, but not always in a positive or accurate way. According to some sources[^1^] [^3^], media portrayals of those with mental illness often skew toward either stigmatization or trivialization, which can spread negative stereotypes and harm public perception and awareness of mental health. For example, some media outlets may depict people with mental illness as violent, dangerous, hopeless, or incompetent[^1^] [^5^], or as comic relief, quirky characters, or plot devices[^3^]. These portrayals can reinforce stigma, discrimination, and misunderstanding of mental health issues.\n\nHowever, there are also some examples of media portrayals that accurately and sensitively depict mental health issues and promote awareness and empathy among the public. For example, some TV shows and movies have featured characters who struggle with mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, PTSD, or schizophrenia, and show their challenges, coping strategies, and recovery journeys[^3^]. Some social media platforms have also been used to share personal stories, educational resources, and positive messages about mental health[^6^] [^9^]. These portrayals can help normalize and destigmatize mental health issues and encourage help-seeking and support among the public.\n\nThe impact of media on mental health awareness is complex and multifaceted. Media can be a powerful tool for informing, educating, and inspiring the public about mental health issues, but it can also be a source of misinformation, sensationalism, and harm. Therefore, it is important for media consumers to be critical and mindful of the messages they receive from different sources, and for media producers to follow ethical and evidence-based guidelines when reporting or portraying mental health issues[^1^] [^7^].",

              "The media teaches us about people with whom we do not routinely interact.",
              "This constant flow of data gives us incessant social cues about the nature of other groups of people\u2014including which groups of people should be praised or scorned.",
              "Media portrayals of those with mental illness often skew toward either stigmatization or trivialization.",
              "Consequently, all forms of media\u2014including television, film, magazines, newspapers, and social media\u2014have been criticized for disseminating negative stereotypes and inaccurate descriptions of those with mental illness.",
              "Stigma involves negative beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors directed toward people based on some distinguishing characteristics.",
              "In the case of mental health stigma, it involves the presence of mental health symptoms or a mental health diagnosis.",
              "In other cases, stigma can also involve health conditions, disabilities, gender, race, sexuality, culture, religion, and sexuality.",

              "\u201d A person considered an \"other\" is denied full social acceptance.",
              "The impact of mental health stigma is serious.",
              "Evidence suggests that it is linked to worse mental health outcomes because it reduces the likelihood that a person will seek help, receive adequate care, and adhere to their treatment plan.",
              "Stigmatization of mental illness in media is abundant.",
              "For example, certain mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia are seen as being so disruptive that people with those conditions must be isolated from society.",
              "The stigmatization of mental illness is so entwined with the media that researchers have used newspaper articles as a proxy metric for stigma in society.",
              "Media accounts tend to focus on the individual with mental illness rather than framing mental illness as a societal issue.",
              "Consequently, media consumers are more likely to blame an individual for the illness.",
              "People with mental illness can also suffer from overgeneralization in media portrayals.",
              "Every person with a specific mental health condition is expected to display the same characteristics or symptoms. For instance, common depictions are that all people with depression are suicidal, and all people with schizophrenia hallucinate.",
              "In reality, 60% and 80% of people with schizophrenia experience auditory hallucinations.",
              "An even smaller number of people experience visual hallucinations.",
              "It's also not uncommon for media portrayals to discount that many people with mental illness don\u2019t need to disclose their condition to everyone around them.",
              "Instead, mental illness often goes unrecognized (whether by intention or not).",
              "The portrayals in the media tend to present situations where everyone in a character's life knows about their mental illness.",
              "Perhaps most concerning, the media often portrays mental illness as untreatable or unrecoverable.",
              "The media can also trivialize mental illness, either by promoting mental illness as not being severe or being less severe than it really is.",
              "For instance, many people with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa feel that their condition is made out to be less severe than it really is.",
              "This is in part because people with the condition portrayed in the media often minimize its seriousness and hide the severe consequences of the disease.",
              "The truth is, the death rate for people with anorexia is high.",
              "In reality, anorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any mental health condition.",

              "Mental illness can also be oversimplified by the media.",
              "For instance, a person with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is often depicted as being overly concerned with cleanliness and perfectionism.",
              "However, the obsessive thoughts that drive their compulsions are overlooked or absent.",
              "The symptoms of mental illness are sometimes portrayed as being beneficial.",
              "For example, in the popular television series Monk, the protagonist is a detective with OCD.",
              "The fact that he pays close attention to detail helps him solve crimes and advance his career.",
              "People who do not have disabilities can use media channels to mock people who do have disabilities, such as by appropriating mental-illness terminology.",
              "For instance, the hashtag OCD (#OCD) is commonly used on Twitter to describe one's attention to cleanliness or organization.",
              "Probably the most disparaging stigmatizations of mental illness in media lie in the film portrayals of antagonists with mental illness.",
              "In particular, when characters with schizophrenia are presented as \u201chomicidal maniacs\u201d in \u201cslasher\u201d or \u201cpsycho killer\u201d movies.",

              "Clement 2012).",
              "A systematic review of school\u2010based interventions to reduce mental health\u2010related stigma noted a dearth of RCT evidence, poor methods, considerable clinical heterogeneity, and inconsistent or null results (Schachter 2008).",

              "These effects may be achieved largely by bringing especially but not exclusively the youngest children into direct, structured contact with an infant, and likely only the oldest children and youth into direct contact with individuals experiencing mental health difficulties.",
              "Similarly, a narrative review of educational interventions for young people concluded that direct contact with people with mental health problems seems to be key in reducing stigmatisation, while the components of education and video\u2010based contact conditions are still arguable (Yamaguchi 2011).",
              "A systematic review of target group\u2010oriented interventions to reduce mental health\u2010related stigma did not report any findings on the efficacy of mass media interventions, although some of the studies included in the review did have mass media elements (Holzinger 2008).",
              "These reviews report that discrimination outcomes are rarely measured (Yamaguchi 2011;",
              "Corrigan 2012).",
              "Evaluations of national anti\u2010stigma programmes which have mass media components have sometimes examined reports of discrimination experienced by people with mental ill health, and have found reductions in discrimination (Wyllie 2011;",
              "Henderson 2012).",
              "These studies did not use the types of study design eligible for inclusion in this review, but their findings suggest that anti\u2010stigma programmes may have the potential to reduce discrimination.",
              "We found very little information about costs.",

The problematic nature of biomedical messages apparent in our review has also been demonstrated in two recent systematic reviews on public attributions for mental illness and levels of stigmatisation (Angermeyer 2011;",
              "Schomerus 2012), and in a consensus development study (Clement 2010).",
              "The latter study recommended the use of \u2018see the person\u2019 messages, and our finding about the benefits of interventions echoes this.",
              "A systematic review of simulated hallucination interventions to reduce stigma (Ando 2011) was in accordance with this review's finding that such interventions can be problematic with regard to stigma, especially when not combined with pre\u2010 and post\u2010simulation activities.",
              "However, the review's qualitative findings from studies which had included a pre\u2010intervention DVD developed by a researcher with personal experience of hearing voices, and a post\u2010simulation debriefing discussion, suggest that when delivered in this way, simulated hallucinations may have a number of beneficial effects.",
              "When we compare our review findings with systematic review evidence about the effectiveness of mass media interventions in other fields, we find that studies on promoting HIV testing (Vidanapathirana 2005) and increasing health service utilisation (Grilli 2002) provided more consistent evidence for the effectiveness of mass media interventions than did the studies in our review.",
              "Our preliminary findings about the benefits of multi\u2010component interventions echo Brinn and colleagues' finding that the more effective interventions tended to be more intensive (Brinn 2010).",
              "Our review is also in agreement with one on mass media and HIV testing (Vidanapathirana 2005) in highlighting the need for more research on different types of media, cost effectiveness and on the characteristics of messages.",
              "This review provides evidence that mass media interventions may reduce prejudice in the immediate, short and medium term.",
              "Overall, the extent to which they do this may be considered small\u2010to\u2010medium, roughly equivalent to reducing the level of prejudice from that associated with symptoms of schizophrenia to the level associated with symptoms of major depression, and mainly rated as \u2018quite important\u2019 by consumers.",
              "Some types of intervention had larger beneficial effects.",
              "Consequently there is justification for continuing to use mass media as one strategy for countering the stigma associated with mental ill health.",
              "Also, as mass media interventions have the potential to reach large numbers of people, even small benefits may have important effects at the population level.",
              "Mass media interventions were able to increase knowledge and were well received in the small number of studies which assessed these outcomes.",
              "This review has implications for the types of mass media intervention that are likely to be most beneficial.",
              "On the basis of our subgroup finding the use of first\u2010person narratives may be promising.",
              "Social inclusion/human rights messages may be effective in reducing prejudice but this result is based on only one study.",
              "We found that the portrayal of acute symptoms or bio\u2010medical messages may contribute to increasing prejudice.",
              "Therefore anti\u2010stigma interventions should avoid including such messages or should use them with caution.",
              "As overall the findings from the five trials with discrimination outcomes were mixed: with effects showing a reduction, increase or evidence of no effect of mass media on discrimination, it is not possible to draw implications for practice about whether, or how, mass media interventions reduce discriminatory behaviour.",
              "These implications must be considered as somewhat uncertain due to limitations in the quality of the available evidence (see Quality of the evidence).",
              "As discussed in Overall completeness and applicability of evidence, the evidence reviewed here cannot necessarily be generalised to all contexts, populations or mass media interventions.",
              "Furthermore, in making decisions about the use of mass media to reduce mental health\u2010related stigma, policy makers will need to consider: the resources and technologies available in the setting in question;",

              "and the values and preferences of relevant stakeholders.",
              "The key research question of whether mass media interventions reduce discrimination remains unresolved by this review, due to the absence of evidence of effect, and limitations in quality of the evidence.",
              "The low quality of the evidence meant that the findings for prejudice were uncertain.",
              "We were not able to assess cost\u2010effectiveness, reach, recall and awareness, and adverse events due to scarcity of evidence.",

              "Little is known about the other forms of indirect social contact such as written autobiography and pictorial representation.",
              "Further research is also needed on celebrity (Corker 2011), and on fictional narratives.",
              "Future studies should build in outcome assessment beyond immediately post\u2010intervention and preferably to six months follow\u2010up or longer.",
              "More studies should include discrimination as an outcome, and more validation of such behaviour measures is needed alongside the development of more direct discrimination outcomes.",
              "Given the multitude of prejudice outcomes and their conceptual differences, it would be helpful for future research to develop a toolkit of validated measures that assess key stigma domains.",
              "Future synthesis might usefully include a number of prejudice outcomes such as social distance, blame, empathy, coercion beliefs, and prognosis beliefs.",
              "From a broader perspective, research could also usefully address the potential impact of public anti\u2010stigma campaigns on the anticipated discrimination or internalised stigma of people with mental health problems (Evans\u2010Lacko 2012b).",

              "Calling a violent offender \u201ccrazy\u201d spreads a dangerous stereotype and belies the complex relationship between criminality and mental illness.",
              "The media teaches us about people with whom we do not routinely interact.",
              "This constant flow of data gives us incessant social cues about the nature of other groups of people\u2014including which groups of people should be praised or scorned.",
              "Media portrayals of those with mental illness often skew toward either stigmatization or trivialization.",
              "Consequently, all forms of media\u2014including television, film, magazines, newspapers, and social media\u2014have been criticized for disseminating negative stereotypes and inaccurate descriptions of those with mental illness.",
              "Stigma involves negative beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors directed toward people based on some distinguishing characteristics.",
              "In the case of mental health stigma, it involves the presence of mental health symptoms or a mental health diagnosis.",
              "In other cases, stigma can also involve health conditions, disabilities, gender, race, sexuality, culture, religion, and sexuality.",
              "Stigma happens when some person is viewed as an \u201cother.",
              "\u201d A person considered an \"other\" is denied full social acceptance.",
              "The impact of mental health stigma is serious.",
              "Evidence suggests that it is linked to worse mental health outcomes because it reduces the likelihood that a person will seek help, receive adequate care, and adhere to their treatment plan.",
              "Stigmatization of mental illness in media is abundant.",
              "For example, certain mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia are seen as being so disruptive that people with those conditions must be isolated from society.",
              "The stigmatization of mental illness is so entwined with the media that researchers have used newspaper articles as a proxy metric for stigma in society.",
              "Media accounts tend to focus on the individual with mental illness rather than framing mental illness as a societal issue.",
              "Consequently, media consumers are more likely to blame an individual for the illness.",
              "People with mental illness can also suffer from overgeneralization in media portrayals.",
              "Every person with a specific mental health condition is expected to display the same characteristics or symptoms. For instance, common depictions are that all people with depression are suicidal, and all people with schizophrenia hallucinate.",
              "In reality, 60% and 80% of people with schizophrenia experience auditory hallucinations.",
              "An even smaller number of people experience visual hallucinations.",
              "It's also not uncommon for media portrayals to discount that many people with mental illness don\u2019t need to disclose their condition to everyone around them.",
              "Instead, mental illness often goes unrecognized (whether by intention or not).",
              "The portrayals in the media tend to present situations where everyone in a character's life knows about their mental illness.",
              "Perhaps most concerning, the media often portrays mental illness as untreatable or unrecoverable.",
              "The media can also trivialize mental illness, either by promoting mental illness as not being severe or being less severe than it really is.",
              "For instance, many people with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa feel that their condition is made out to be less severe than it really is.",
              "This is in part because people with the condition portrayed in the media often minimize its seriousness and hide the severe consequences of the disease.",
              "The truth is, the death rate for people with anorexia is high.",
              "In reality, anorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any mental health condition.",
              "Research suggests the risk of dying is 10 times higher for people who have anorexia nervosa.",
              "Mental illness can also be oversimplified by the media.",
              "For instance, a person with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is often depicted as being overly concerned with cleanliness and perfectionism.",
              "However, the obsessive thoughts that drive their compulsions are overlooked or absent.",
              "The symptoms of mental illness are sometimes portrayed as being beneficial.",
              "For example, in the popular television series Monk, the protagonist is a detective with OCD.",
              "The fact that he pays close attention to detail helps him solve crimes and advance his career.",
              "People who do not have disabilities can use media channels to mock people who do have disabilities, such as by appropriating mental-illness terminology.",
              "For instance, the hashtag OCD (#OCD) is commonly used on Twitter to describe one's attention to cleanliness or organization.",
              "Probably the most disparaging stigmatizations of mental illness in media lie in the film portrayals of antagonists with mental illness.",
              "In particular, when characters with schizophrenia are presented as \u201chomicidal maniacs\u201d in \u201cslasher\u201d or \u201cpsycho killer\u201d movies.",
              "Inaccurate portrayals of mental illness in the media disseminate misinformation about the symptoms, causes, and treatment of schizophrenia and other forms of severe mental illness.",
              "Unfortunately, popular movies and tv shows can exert potent influences on attitude formation.",
              "In one study, researchers analyzed 41 movies that had been released between 1990 and 2010 for depictions of schizophrenia.",
              "Based on the findings of the analysis, researchers drew several conclusions.",
              "Research has also found that 75% of depictions of mental illness in popular video games are negative or stereotyped.",
              "These portrayals are not only incorrect but damaging\u2014and for several reasons.",
              "The portrayals of schizophrenia often focus on symptoms such as visual hallucinations, bizarre delusions, and disorganized speech, and present them as commonplace.",
              "In reality, symptoms like decreased motivation, poverty of speech, and flat affect are more common.",
              "Several movies have spread the false stereotype that people with schizophrenia are prone to violence and unpredictable behavior.",
              "Some films even presented people with schizophrenia as being \u201cpossessed.",
              "\u201d These violent stereotypes influence viewers and engender harsh negative attitudes toward people with mental illness.",
              "While suicide is a significant concern for people with schizophrenia, the research on media portrayals of schizophrenia found that this risk is often exaggerated in film and tv representations.",
              "In one study, 24% of the characters with schizophrenia committed suicide.",
              "In reality, estimates suggest that between 4% and 13% of people with schizophrenia die by suicide, and approximately 18% to 55% attempt suicide at some point in their lifetime.",
              "Demographics is another aspect of mental illness that is often misrepresented by media portrayals of mental illness.",
              "For example, characters with schizophrenia are frequently depicted as being white males, but schizophrenia disproportionately affects African Americans.",
              "It also affects men and women almost equally.",
              "In a few movies, schizophrenia was depicted as being secondary to traumatic life events or curable by love\u2014both of which are misrepresentations of the condition's causes and treatment.",
              "This episode of The Verywell Mind Podcast points out the bad mental health advice you may find on social media.",
              "Click below to listen now.",
              "Follow Now: Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / Amazon Music Not all the information presented about schizophrenia was found to be incorrect, misleading, or stigmatizing.",
              "\ufeff\ufeff For example, in more than half of the movies that researchers analyzed, the use of psychiatric medications was depicted or alluded to.",
              "Nearly half the characters with schizophrenia were depicted as being poor, which aligns with epidemiological data suggesting that schizophrenia is diagnosed less frequently in people of higher socioeconomic standing.",
              "Even when some movies get it right, the negative media portrayals\u2014especially those that are violent\u2014of people with schizophrenia and other severe forms of mental illness still contribute to stigmatization, stereotyping, discrimination, and social rejection.",
              "The impact of mental health stigmatization by the media can contribute to a number of different effects.",
              "We need a better understanding of how these messages are disseminated by the media before we can rectify them.",
              "There is limited research looking at how media promotes mental-illness stereotypes, stigmatization, and trivialization.",
              "Nevertheless, certain suggestions have been made on how to improve the depiction of people with mental illness in the media, such as: As individuals who consume copious amounts of mass media and engage with social media, the best thing we can do is stop using words like \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cderanged\u201d in a derogatory or flippant fashion.",
              "We also need to remember that it's best to avoid making a psychiatric diagnosis outside of a clinical setting.",
              "Only a specialist can make a diagnosis of OCD, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other mental health conditions.",
              "When we give someone the label of being mentally ill without clinical evidence, we hurt people who live with mental illness on a daily basis.",

              "A 2017 study published in \u201cPsychological Science in the Public Interest\u201d found that 40% of the 60 million people living with mental illness go without treatment.",
              "The study identified two perception-related barriers to care: stigma surrounding mental health and people\u2019s inability to recognize their symptoms. The results of this study beg the question: How can we best eradicate stigma and help people identify when they are experiencing symptoms of mental health conditions?",
              "Perhaps we should turn to Gen Z when looking for answers, as young people are beginning to chip away at these barriers \u2014 largely with their openness on social media.",
              "While social media can be a minefield of triggering content \u2014 whether it\u2019s encouraging unhealthy comparisons or exposing users to destructive behaviors \u2014 online platforms like Instagram and TikTok also provide spaces to share personal experience with mental illness, find community support and work through trauma in creative ways.",
              "Ultimately, the access to a wide array of personal stories and mental health journeys encourages an open dialogue and allows for more nuanced portrayals of mental health conditions than what we consume in sensationalized films and TV shows.",
              "Thus, social media\u2019s role in changing the dialogue could be considered a critical step in addressing barriers to treatment.",
              "When perusing your Instagram feed or the TikTok \u201cFor You Page,\u201d you\u2019re likely to discover mental health content, thanks to the sheer volume of related posts.",
              "The #MentalHealth hashtag has been used in millions of TikTok videos, racking up 11 billion views, and it has generated nearly 30 million public Instagram posts.",
              "This flood of mental health-related posts undeniably normalizes the discussion of mental illness.",
              "Young celebrities, influencers and private individuals alike have opened up about their mental health conditions, sharing videos and posts addressing their experiences, panic attacks, depressive episodes, recovery, etc.",
              "In May 2021, former \u201cBachelorette\u201d lead and current \u201cBachelor\u201d host Kaitlyn Bristowe shared a selfie with her 2 million followers in which she spoke candidly about her mental health journey.",

              "Social media, while certainly not an immediate solution to this problem, does serve as a direct line from individuals to audiences.",

              "By Margot Harris As the 1 in 5 adults living with mental illness know all too well, accessing resources and receiving adequate care can be a challenging process.",
              "A 2017 study published in \u201cPsychological Science in the Public Interest\u201d found that 40% of the 60 million people living with mental illness go without treatment.",
              "The study identified two perception-related barriers to care: stigma surrounding mental health and people\u2019s inability to recognize their symptoms. The results of this study beg the question: How can we best eradicate stigma and help people identify when they are experiencing symptoms of mental health conditions?",
              "Perhaps we should turn to Gen Z when looking for answers, as young people are beginning to chip away at these barriers \u2014 largely with their openness on social media.",
              "While social media can be a minefield of triggering content \u2014 whether it\u2019s encouraging unhealthy comparisons or exposing users to destructive behaviors \u2014 online platforms like Instagram and TikTok also provide spaces to share personal experience with mental illness, find community support and work through trauma in creative ways.",
              "Ultimately, the access to a wide array of personal stories and mental health journeys encourages an open dialogue and allows for more nuanced portrayals of mental health conditions than what we consume in sensationalized films and TV shows.",
              "Thus, social media\u2019s role in changing the dialogue could be considered a critical step in addressing barriers to treatment.",
              "When perusing your Instagram feed or the TikTok \u201cFor You Page,\u201d you\u2019re likely to discover mental health content, thanks to the sheer volume of related posts.",
              "The #MentalHealth hashtag has been used in millions of TikTok videos, racking up 11 billion views, and it has generated nearly 30 million public Instagram posts.",
              "This flood of mental health-related posts undeniably normalizes the discussion of mental illness.",
              "Young celebrities, influencers and private individuals alike have opened up about their mental health conditions, sharing videos and posts addressing their experiences, panic attacks, depressive episodes, recovery, etc.",
              "In May 2021, former \u201cBachelorette\u201d lead and current \u201cBachelor\u201d host Kaitlyn Bristowe shared a selfie with her 2 million followers in which she spoke candidly about her mental health journey.",
              "\u201cI have led a pretty blessed life, and I still suffer from depression and anxiety,\u201d she captioned the photo.",
              "\u201cI still need to work on my shadows, stop believing the lies I tell myself, overcoming my traumas (big or small), and learning to love myself.",
              "Therapy has helped me for the last eight years more than I can put into words.",
              "\u201d The ABC star and influencer\u2019s post received nearly 85,000 likes and hundreds of comments from followers who shared the difference that therapy made in their lives.",
              "\u201cThank you for this reminder,\u201d one commenter wrote.",
              "\u201cGetting help is normal!",
              "\u201d Beyond creating an open dialogue, social media platforms also encourage a fresh approach to coping with and explaining mental illness \u2014 specifically, using humor.",
              "In one viral TikTok video, a creator jokes about placing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a common anti-depressant medication, in a colorful gumball dispenser.",
              "In another video, set to dramatic background music, a creator \u201ckeeps score\u201d of her daily match against OCD.",
              "She wins a point when she allows items on her desk to remain out of place.",
              "OCD scores a point when she reverts to obsessive thinking.",
              "Both videos have received hundreds of comments from viewers who joked that they felt \u201cpersonally attacked\u201d by the accuracy of the clips.",
              "Naturally, there are drawbacks to approaching mental illness with only humor and short captions.",
              "Mental health conditions are more complex than a two-sentence description and can result in serious complications if not treated appropriately.",
              "However, tongue-in-cheek posts can make a mental health diagnosis seem less foreign or daunting.",
              "Perhaps beginning a medication regimen feels less intimidating knowing that another TikTok user has had a positive experience taking the same SSRI.",
              "Or maybe a day of \u201closing\u201d to OCD doesn\u2019t feel so isolating knowing someone else is facing a similar battle and finding ways to poke fun at the occasional setbacks.",
              "As the robust comment sections on these posts suggest, social media platforms offer a place for healing and finding community \u2014 and, in the process, reducing stigma.",
              "As individuals with mental illness frequently point out, Hollywood rarely offers an accurate depiction of their conditions.",
              "Reductive tropes in horror movies or brief, tragic character arcs on medical shows offer a limited understanding of what mental illness looks like day to day.",
              "It\u2019s no surprise, then, that a research study identified a failure to recognize symptoms as a barrier to treatment.",
              "If audiences understand dissociative identity disorder (DID) to be an affliction causing homicidal tendencies (as suggested in the 2016 thriller \u201cSplit\u201d) or view borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a character flaw of chronically unstable and selfish women (as suggested in Grey\u2019s Anatomy) they\u2019re unlikely to identify their own behaviors as symptoms of mental illness.",
              "Social media, while certainly not an immediate solution to this problem, does serve as a direct line from individuals to audiences.",
              "Simply put, users are free to share the real, mundane, Hollywood-unfriendly version of mental health conditions \u2014 symptoms that audiences may be more likely to recognize in themselves.",
              "Rather than seeing homicidal rage marketed by Hollywood, audiences are exposed to content creators experiencing fatigue, dissociation, obsessive thoughts or aversion to certain tasks and behaviors.",
              "They\u2019re witnessing the day-to-day reality of BPD or OCD.",
              "They\u2019re given implicit reminders that people living with mental illness are just people.",
              "While social media is a complex tool that can exacerbate anxiety or promote unhealthy habits, it also contributes significantly to the ongoing dialogue surrounding mental health.",
              "An estimated 4 billion people use some form of social media \u2014 and most of these users will see mental health-related content at some point while scrolling through their feeds.",
              "Much of the available content takes the form of personal stories, which both destigmatize mental health conditions and offer a fresh perspective of what mental illness really looks like.",
              "As the next generation continues to share this perspective, we have reason to be optimistic that stigma-related barriers to care won\u2019t last forever.",

              "Indeed, mental disorders are among the causes for the rise in violence among children and youth.",
              "[7] The media do not make it clear to the public, however, that only a minority of those afflicted with Mental Disorder commit severe crimes and that the actual occurrence of violence by persons with mental illness is less than by so-called normal people.",
              "[8,9] Very common in television dramas or films are depictions of persons afflicted with Mental Disorder as violent and unpredictable, as victims, or as incapable of holding down a job.",
              "[10,11] What is prominent in television programs is not only the connection of violence with people afflicted with mental disorders but also the tendency to place responsibility for scandals and tragedies associated with them on the policy that supports deinstitutionalization and community-based services.",
              "[12] Another type of mass media distortion of mental disorder is evident in the sexist stance applied to them.",
              "Men were overrepresented as having serious mental illness such as psychoses, personality disorders, and childhood problems. In contrast, women were over-represented with problems and models of sexual dysfunction, neuroses, and so on.",

              "With the scripts, child fantasizes behaving in that way to solve problems. Exposure to media violence (through excessive violent video games or violent TV programs) has been positively related to subsequent aggressive behavior, ideas, arousal, and anger.",
              "Excessive exposure to violence through media adversely affected psychosocial adjustment and school performance of children.",

              "These concerns are contrasted by growing interest in the potential for new technologies including social media to expand the reach of services to underrepresented minority groups (Schueller, Hunter, Figueroa, & Aguilera, 2019).",
              "Therefore, greater attention is needed to understanding the perspectives of ethnic and racial minorities to inform effective and safe use of social media for mental health promotion efforts.",
              "Research has found that individuals living with mental illness have expressed interest in accessing mental health services through social media platforms. A survey of social media users with mental illness found that most respondents were interested in accessing programs for mental health on social media targeting symptom management, health promotion, and support for communicating with health care providers and interacting with the health system (Naslund et al.",
              ", 2017).",
              "Importantly, individuals with serious mental illness have also emphasized that any mental health intervention on social media would need to be moderated by someone with adequate training and credentials, would need to have ground rules and ways to promote safety and minimize risks, and importantly, would need to be free and easy to access.",
              "An important strength with this commentary is that it combines a range of studies broadly covering the topic of social media and mental health.",
              "We have provided a summary of recent evidence in a rapidly advancing field with the goal of presenting unique ways that social media could offer benefits for individuals with mental illness, while also acknowledging the potentially serious risks and the need for further investigation.",
              "There are also several limitations with this commentary that warrant consideration.",
              "Importantly, as we aimed to address this broad objective, we did not conduct a systematic review of the literature.",
              "Therefore, the studies reported here are not exhaustive, and there may be additional relevant studies that were not included.",
              "Additionally, we only summarized published studies, and as a result, any reports from the private sector or websites from different organizations using social media or other apps containing social media-like features would have been omitted.",
              "Though it is difficult to rigorously summarize work from the private sector, sometimes referred to as \u201cgray literature\u201d, because many of these projects are unpublished and are likely selective in their reporting of findings given the target audience may be shareholders or consumers.",
              "Another notable limitation is that we did not assess risk of bias in the studies summarized in this commentary.",
              "We found many studies that highlighted risks associated with social media use for individuals living with mental illness;",
              "however, few studies of programs or interventions reported negative findings, suggesting the possibility that negative findings may go unpublished.",

              "Most of the studies that we described were from the United States, as well as from other higher income settings such as Australia or the United Kingdom.",
              "Despite the global reach of social media platforms, there is a dearth of research on the impact of these platforms on the mental health of individuals in diverse settings, as well as the ways in which social media could support mental health services in lower income countries where there is virtually no access to mental health providers.",
              "Future research is necessary to explore the opportunities and risks for social media to support mental health promotion in low-income and middle-income countries, especially as these countries face a disproportionate share of the global burden of mental disorders, yet account for the majority of social media users worldwide (Naslund et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "As we consider future research directions, the near ubiquitous social media use also yields new opportunities to study the onset and manifestation of mental health symptoms and illness severity earlier than traditional clinical assessments.",
              "There is an emerging field of research referred to as \u2018digital phenotyping\u2019 aimed at capturing how individuals interact with their digital devices, including social media platforms, in order to study patterns of illness and identify optimal time points for intervention (Jain, Powers, Hawkins, & Brownstein, 2015;",
              "Onnela & Rauch, 2016).",
              "Given that most people access social media via mobile devices, digital phenotyping and social media are closely related (Torous et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "To date, the emergence of machine learning, a powerful computational method involving statistical and mathematical algorithms (Shatte, Hutchinson, & Teague, 2019), has made it possible to study large quantities of data captured from popular social media platforms such as Twitter or Instagram to illuminate various features of mental health (Manikonda & De Choudhury, 2017;",
              "Reece et al.",
              ", 2017).",
              "Specifically, conversations on Twitter have been analyzed to characterize the onset of depression (De Choudhury, Gamon, Counts, & Horvitz, 2013) as well as detecting users\u2019 mood and affective states (De Choudhury, Gamon, & Counts, 2012), while photos posted to Instagram can yield insights for predicting depression (Reece & Danforth, 2017).",
              "The intersection of social media and digital phenotyping will likely add new levels of context to social media use in the near future.",
              "Several studies have also demonstrated that when compared to a control group, Twitter users with a self-disclosed diagnosis of schizophrenia show unique online communication patterns (Michael L Birnbaum, Ernala, Rizvi, De Choudhury, & Kane, 2017), including more frequent discussion of tobacco use (Hswen et al.",
              ", 2017), symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hswen, Naslund, Brownstein, & Hawkins, 2018b), and suicide (Hswen, Naslund, Brownstein, & Hawkins, 2018a).",
              "Another study found that online disclosures about mental illness appeared beneficial as reflected by fewer posts about symptoms following self-disclosure (Ernala, Rizvi, Birnbaum, Kane, & De Choudhury, 2017).",
              "Each of these examples offers early insights into the potential to leverage widely available online data for better understanding the onset and course of mental illness.",
              "It is possible that social media data could be used to supplement additional digital data, such as continuous monitoring using smartphone apps or smart watches, to generate a more comprehensive \u2018digital phenotype\u2019 to predict relapse and identify high-risk health behaviors among individuals living with mental illness (Torous et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "With research increasingly showing the valuable insights that social media data can yield about mental health states, greater attention to the ethical concerns with using individual data in this way is necessary (Chancellor, Birnbaum, Caine, Silenzio, & De Choudhury, 2019).",
              "For instance, data is typically captured from social media platforms without the consent or awareness of users (Bidargaddi et al.",
              ", 2017), which is especially crucial when the data relates to a socially stigmatizing health condition such as mental illness (Guntuku, Yaden, Kern, Ungar, & Eichstaedt, 2017).",
              "Precautions are needed to ensure that data is not made identifiable in ways that were not originally intended by the user who posted the content, as this could place an individual at risk of harm or divulge sensitive health information (Webb et al.",
              ", 2017;",
              "Williams, Burnap, & Sloan, 2017).",
              "Promising approaches for minimizing these risks include supporting the participation of individuals with expertise in privacy, clinicians, as well as the target individuals with mental illness throughout the collection of data, development of predictive algorithms, and interpretation of findings (Chancellor et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "In recognizing that many individuals living with mental illness use social media to search for information about their mental health, it is possible that they may also want to ask their clinicians about what they find online to check if the information is reliable and trustworthy.",
              "Alternatively, many individuals may feel embarrassed or reluctant to talk to their clinicians about using social media to find mental health information out of concerns of being judged or dismissed.",
              "Therefore, mental health clinicians may be ideally positioned to talk with their patients about using social media, and offer recommendations to promote safe use of these sites, while also respecting their patients\u2019 autonomy and personal motivations for using these popular platforms. Given the gap in clinical knowledge about the impact of social media on mental health, clinicians should be aware of the many potential risks so that they can inform their patients, while remaining open to the possibility that their patients may also experience benefits through use of these platforms. As awareness of these risks grows, it may be possible that new protections will be put in place by industry or through new policies that will make the social media environment safer.",
              "It is hard to estimate a number needed to treat or harm today given the nascent state of research, which means the patient and clinician need to weigh the choice on a personal level.",
              "Thus offering education and information is an important first step in that process.",
              "As patients increasingly show interest in accessing mental health information or services through social media, it will be necessary for health systems to recognize social media as a potential avenue for reaching or offering support to patients.",
              "This aligns with growing emphasis on the need for greater integration of digital psychiatry, including apps, smartphones, or wearable devices, into patient care and clinical services through institution-wide initiatives and training clinical providers (Hilty, Chan, Torous, Luo, & Boland, 2019).",
              "Within a learning healthcare environment where research and care are tightly intertwined and feedback between both is rapid, the integration of digital technologies into services may create new opportunities for advancing use of social media for mental health.",
              "As highlighted in this commentary, social media has become an important part of the lives of many individuals living with mental disorders.",
              "Many of these individuals use social media to share their lived experiences with mental illness, to seek support from others, and to search for information about treatment recommendations, accessing mental health services, and coping with symptoms (Bucci et al.",

              "As the field of digital mental health advances, the wide reach, ease of access, and popularity of social media platforms could be used to allow individuals in need of mental health services or facing challenges of mental illness to access evidence-based treatment and support.",
              "To achieve this end and to explore whether social media platforms can advance efforts to close the gap in available mental health services in the United States and globally, it will be essential for researchers to work closely with clinicians and with those affected by mental illness to ensure that possible benefits of using social media are carefully weighed against anticipated risks.",

              "Inaccurate representations of mental illness create barriers to reducing stigma, forcing mental health advocates to work overtime to undo these damaging stereotypes.",
              "We need the entertainment industry to start accepting responsibility for the role they have in the mental health movement.",
              "There have been very few representations of schizophrenia in Hollywood that were not violent.",
              "In the comedy, \u201cMe, Myself and Irene,\u201d Jim Carrey\u2019s character is supposed to represent a man with schizophrenia, but it is actually a representation of dissociative identity disorder (DID).",
              "Not only does it contribute to the common misconception that schizophrenia means having multiple personalities, it portrays one of those personalities as violent, promoting one of the most common stigmas associated with schizophrenia.",
              "When an illness that has very little understanding by the general public becomes represented on the big screen, that representation becomes many people's understanding of it.",
              "Former NAMI Executive Director Laurie Flynn once said of Jim Carrey's character in \u201cMe, Myself and Irene,\u201d \u201cThis character's violent, unpredictable behavior will be unfairly associated with having schizophrenia.",

              "According to an article in Mental Health Today, \u201cAfter some friends and family of those with DID watched the film, there have been stories and desperate pleas from a person diagnosed being isolated from friends, thrown out of home by family, losing their job at work, and even having their children reported to social services with nothing more than the previously nice neighbors watching this so-called \u2018just a film.",

              "In fact, psychosis has been so heavily misunderstood that \u201cpsychotic\u201d remains an extremely common on-screen insult, used to mean that someone is \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201cdangerous.",
