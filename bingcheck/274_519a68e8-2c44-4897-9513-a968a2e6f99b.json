    "query": "What is the historical and cultural significance behind the traditional art of Thai puppetry, and how has it evolved over time to become a revered form of performance art in Thai culture?",
    "response": "The traditional art of Thai puppetry, known as **hun lakhon lek**, is an ancient art form similar to Japanese bunraku puppetry[^1^]. Each puppet, usually just under a meter long (3.2 feet), is controlled by three people with a rope and pulley system, which help make the puppet look as if it is gracefully dancing on stage[^1^]. The puppets are usually made of wood, cloth, and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, and are dressed in elaborate costumes and accessories[^4^].\n\nThe art of hun lakhon lek originated in the royal court of Thailand (formerly Siam) in the 17th century, influenced by Chinese rod puppetry[^3^]. The puppets were used to perform stories from the Ramakien (Thai version of the Ramayana) or other epics and legends[^3^]. The performances were accompanied by a piphat orchestra and a narrator who recited the dialogue and narration[^3^]. The puppeteers were hidden behind a painted backdrop or a curtain, and only their hands and feet were visible[^3^].\n\nThe art of hun lakhon lek declined in popularity after the fall of Ayutthaya kingdom in 1767, and was almost extinct by the 20th century[^1^]. However, some puppeteers continued to preserve and revive the art form, such as Master Nivet Waevsamana, who founded the Joe Louis Puppet Theatre in 1985[^2^]. He introduced innovations such as bringing the puppeteers on stage with the puppets, using modern lighting and sound effects, and creating new stories and characters based on contemporary issues[^2^]. He also trained a new generation of puppeteers and performers who have won international recognition and awards for their skills and creativity[^2^].\n\nToday, hun lakhon lek is considered a revered form of performance art in Thai culture, as it showcases the rich heritage, craftsmanship, and aesthetics of Thailand. It also reflects the values and morals of Thai society, such as respect for elders, loyalty to friends, compassion for others, and courage in facing challenges. Hun lakhon lek is not only a form of entertainment, but also a way of preserving and promoting Thai identity and culture in the modern world[^5^].",

              "This inconsistency was due to the fact that the amount of work and money charged depended, case by case, on the members of the troupe, with Master Sakhon making decisions on for whom they would perform and on how much money they would request for the performance.",
              "The amount of money received would be divided between the puppeteers and musicians, and a separate amount kept as capital for further shows (Navikamoon, 2004, p.",

              "Each puppet, usually just under a meter long (3.",
              "2 feet), is controlled by three people with a rope and pulley system, which help make the puppet look as if it is gracefully dancing on stage.",
              "The shows are usually accompanied by both music and a narrator who normally tells a story derived from the Ramakien, the Thai version of the Hindu Ramayana.",
              "The puppeteers are masters at making these objects come alive during a performance, and anyone who views a show will soon forget there is someone behind the colourful and lively puppet as it seemingly takes on a life of its own.",

              "The country lost interest in the art around World War II, but in 1995, the art form made a huge comeback with the construction of Nattayasala Hun Lakhon Lek (Joe Louis Thai Puppet Theatre), the first Thai puppetry theatre in Bangkok.",

              "In this period, the performances the theatre offered became more modern, as their clientele are primarily tourists, and the style of the shows was adjusted so that it was more appropriate for this audience.",
              "The puppets changed in their structure, mechanism, and even attire, so as to appear more attractive (Posayakrit, 1986, p.",

              "During the period The Sakhon Nattasilp Hun Lakhon Lek Larn Kru Krae Troupe, the income was variable.",
              "This inconsistency was due to the fact that the amount of work and money charged depended, case by case, on the members of the troupe, with Master Sakhon making decisions on for whom they would perform and on how much money they would request for the performance.",
              "The amount of money received would be divided between the puppeteers and musicians, and a separate amount kept as capital for further shows (Navikamoon, 2004, p.",
              "52).",
              "The income at the Joe Louis Theatre on Bangkok-Nonthaburi 12 Lane however, differed owing to their having a permanent theatre where the shows could be held regularly.",
              "In this way, a fee for tickets could be collected.",
              "The income at the rental home theatre in Nonthaburi, before the fire was derived from the flat rate they charged per show per number of viewers: US$55-85 per 20 to 30 viewers.",
              "However, the income the troupe received at the Joe Louis Theatre came from various sources.",
              "With a permanent theatre, the troupe was able to have a marketing plan to attract audiences, both Thai and international, and educational institutions, for example, schools and universities (Jirajarupat, 2008, p.",
              "105).",
              "The total income can be broken down as follows: As the troupe moved into the Traditional Thai Puppet Theatre (Joe Louis) at Suan Lum Night Bazaar, they experienced a number of changes (Navikamoon, 2004, p.",
              "60).",
              "The most visible was the larger organisation they had now become, necessitating a more business-like management style.",
              "The income they received was now also more consistent.",
              "There are other businesses related to the shows, which also have contributed to their survival (Pannengpetch, 1992, p.",
              "135).",
              "Selling Khon masks and headdresses at major shopping areas is a business, which has been carried out since the beginning of The Sakhon Nattasilp Hun Lakhon Lek Larn Kru Krae Troupe.",

              "It was a temporary theatre consisting only of a puppetry stage.",

              "The style of the performances became more distinct with the appearance of puppets relatively similar to those used in the first period, and with Ramayana as their main stories.",
              "Dancers, however, were employed in this period to accompany the puppetry performance.",

              "In this period, the performances the theatre offered became more modern, as their clientele are primarily tourists, and the style of the shows was adjusted so that it was more appropriate for this audience.",
              "The puppets changed in their structure, mechanism, and even attire, so as to appear more attractive (Posayakrit, 1986, p.",

              "100) as follows: The most important factor in the continued existence of the Traditional Thai Puppet Theatre (Joe Louis) is the determination to keep Thai theatrical puppetry active.",
              "A symbol of this determination by the Yangkhiawsod family was the founding of the organisation for theatrical puppetry performances when they were The Sakhon Nattasilp Hun Lakhon Lek Larn Kru Krae Troupe.",

              "During the period The Sakhon Nattasilp Hun Lakhon Lek Larn Kru Krae Troupe, the income was variable.",
              "This inconsistency was due to the fact that the amount of work and money charged depended, case by case, on the members of the troupe, with Master Sakhon making decisions on for whom they would perform and on how much money they would request for the performance.",
              "The amount of money received would be divided between the puppeteers and musicians, and a separate amount kept as capital for further shows (Navikamoon, 2004, p.",

              "The income at the Joe Louis Theatre on Bangkok-Nonthaburi 12 Lane however, differed owing to their having a permanent theatre where the shows could be held regularly.",

              "The total income can be broken down as follows: As the troupe moved into the Traditional Thai Puppet Theatre (Joe Louis) at Suan Lum Night Bazaar, they experienced a number of changes (Navikamoon, 2004, p.",
              "60).",
              "The most visible was the larger organisation they had now become, necessitating a more business-like management style.",
              "The income they received was now also more consistent.",
              "There are other businesses related to the shows, which also have contributed to their survival (Pannengpetch, 1992, p.",
