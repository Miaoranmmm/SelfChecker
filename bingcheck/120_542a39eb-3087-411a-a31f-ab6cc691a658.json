    "response": "That's a great question! Astronomy is a fascinating field that has made many amazing discoveries in the past decade. Some of the most notable ones are:\n\n- The discovery of the first potentially habitable exoplanet, Kepler-22b, in 2010[^1^]. This planet orbits a star similar to our sun and has a surface temperature that could allow liquid water to exist.\n- The discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system in 2015[^1^], which consists of seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a red dwarf star. Three of these planets are in the habitable zone and could have oceans on their surfaces.\n- The first observation of gravitational waves in 2015[^1^], which confirmed Einstein's prediction of ripples in spacetime caused by massive collisions of black holes or neutron stars. This opened a new window into the universe and its extreme phenomena.\n- The first detection of an interstellar object, 'Oumuamua, in 2017[^1^], which was a mysterious cigar-shaped visitor from another star system. It was followed by another one, 2I/Borisov, in 2019[^1^], which was confirmed to be a comet.\n- The first image of a black hole's event horizon in 2019[^2^], which was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope, a network of eight radio telescopes around the world. The image showed the shadow of a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy called M87.\n\nThese are just some examples of the incredible discoveries that have been made in astronomy in the past decade. There are many more that I could mention, such as the exploration of Pluto by New Horizons, the end of Cassini's mission at Saturn, the discovery of thousands of exoplanets by Kepler and TESS, and the launch of several new space telescopes and missions. Astronomy is truly an exciting and dynamic field that constantly reveals new wonders and mysteries about our universe.\ud83c\udf20",

              "[3][4][5] Previously, gravitational waves had been inferred only indirectly, via their effect on the timing of pulsars in binary star systems. The waveform, detected by both LIGO observatories,[6] matched the predictions of general relativity[7][8][9] for a gravitational wave emanating from the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes of around 36 and 29 solar masses and the subsequent \"ringdown\" of the single resulting black hole.",

              "This first direct observation was reported around the world as a remarkable accomplishment for many reasons.",
              "Efforts to directly prove the existence of such waves had been ongoing for over fifty years, and the waves are so minuscule that Albert Einstein himself doubted that they could ever be detected.",
              "[12][13] The waves given off by the cataclysmic merger of GW150914 reached Earth as a ripple in spacetime that changed the length of a 4 km LIGO arm by a thousandth of the width of a proton,[11] proportionally equivalent to changing the distance to the nearest star outside the Solar System by one hair's width.",

              "It was also heralded as inaugurating a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy, which will enable observations of violent astrophysical events that were not previously possible and potentially allow the direct observation of the very earliest history of the universe.",

              "[22] Eight more observations were made in 2017, including GW170817, the first observed merger of binary neutron stars, which was also observed in electromagnetic radiation.",
              "Albert Einstein originally predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916,[24][25] on the basis of his theory of general relativity.",
              "[26] General relativity interprets gravity as a consequence of distortions in space-time, caused by mass.",
              "Therefore, Einstein also predicted that events in the cosmos would cause \"ripples\" in space-time \u2013 distortions of space-time itself \u2013 which would spread outward, although they would be so minuscule that they would be nearly impossible to detect by any technology foreseen at that time.",
              "[13] It was also predicted that objects moving in an orbit would lose energy for this reason (a consequence of the law of conservation of energy), as some energy would be given off as gravitational waves, although this would be insignificantly small in all but the most extreme cases.",
              "[27] One case where gravitational waves would be strongest is during the final moments of the merger of two compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes.",
              "Over a span of millions of years, binary neutron stars, and binary black holes lose energy, largely through gravitational waves, and as a result, they spiral in towards each other.",
              "At the very end of this process, the two objects will reach extreme velocities, and in the final fraction of a second of their merger a substantial amount of their mass would theoretically be converted into gravitational energy, and travel outward as gravitational waves,[28] allowing a greater than usual chance for detection.",
              "However, since little was known about the number of compact binaries in the universe and reaching that final stage can be very slow, there was little certainty as to how often such events might happen.",
              "[29] Gravitational waves can be detected indirectly \u2013 by observing celestial phenomena caused by gravitational waves \u2013 or more directly by means of instruments such as the Earth-based LIGO or the planned space-based LISA instrument.",
              "[30] Evidence of gravitational waves was first deduced in 1974 through the motion of the double neutron star system PSR B1913+16, in which one of the stars is a pulsar that emits electro-magnetic pulses at radio frequencies at precise, regular intervals as it rotates.",
              "Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor, who discovered the stars, also showed that over time, the frequency of pulses shortened, and that the stars were gradually spiralling towards each other with an energy loss that agreed closely with the predicted energy that would be radiated by gravitational waves.",
              "[31][32] For this work, Hulse and Taylor were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1993.",
              "[33] Further observations of this pulsar and others in multiple systems (such as the double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039) also agree with General Relativity to high precision.",
              "[34][35] Direct observation of gravitational waves was not possible for the many decades after they were predicted due to the minuscule effect that would need to be detected and separated from the background of vibrations present everywhere on Earth.",
              "A technique called interferometry was suggested in the 1960s and eventually technology developed sufficiently for this technique to become feasible.",
              "In the present approach used by LIGO, a laser beam is split and the two halves are recombined after travelling different paths.",
              "Changes to the length of the paths or the time taken for the two split beams, caused by the effect of passing gravitational waves, to reach the point where they recombine are revealed as \"beats\".",
              "Such a technique is extremely sensitive to tiny changes in the distance or time taken to traverse the two paths.",
              "In theory, an interferometer with arms about 4 km long would be capable of revealing the change of space-time \u2013 a tiny fraction of the size of a single proton \u2013 as a gravitational wave of sufficient strength passed through Earth from elsewhere.",
              "This effect would be perceptible only to other interferometers of a similar size, such as the Virgo, GEO 600 and planned KAGRA and INDIGO detectors.",
              "In practice at least two interferometers would be needed because any gravitational wave would be detected at both of these but other kinds of disturbance would generally not be present at both.",

              "General relativity predicts that this silhouette would be roughly circular, but other theories of gravity predict slightly different shapes.",
