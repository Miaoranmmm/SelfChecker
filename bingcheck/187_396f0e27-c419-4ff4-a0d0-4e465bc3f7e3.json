              "Quantum tunnelling - Wikipedia",
              "In physics, quantum tunnelling, barrier penetration, or simply tunnelling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which an object such as an electron or atom passes through a potential energy barrier that, according to classical mechanics, the object does not have sufficient energy to enter or surmount.",
              "Tunneling is a consequence of the wave nature of matter, where the quantum wave function describes the state of a particle or other physical system, and wave equations such as the Schro\u0308dinger equation describe their behavior.",
              "The probability of transmission of a wave packet through a barrier decreases exponentially with the barrier height, the barrier width, and the tunneling particle's mass, so tunneling is seen most prominently in low-mass particles such as electrons or protons tunneling through microscopically narrow barriers.",
              "Tunneling is readily detectable with barriers of thickness about 1\u20133 nm or smaller for electrons, and about 0.",
              "1 nm or smaller for heavier particles such as protons or hydrogen atoms.[1] Some sources describe the mere penetration of a wave function into the barrier, without transmission on the other side, as a tunneling effect, such as in tunneling into the walls of a finite potential well.",
              "[2][3] Tunneling plays an essential role in physical phenomena such as nuclear fusion[4] and alpha radioactive decay of atomic nuclei.",
              "Tunneling applications include the tunnel diode,[5] quantum computing, flash memory, and the scanning tunneling microscope.",
              "Tunneling limits the minimum size of devices used in microelectronics because electrons tunnel readily through insulating layers and transistors that are thinner than about 1 nm.",
              "[6][7] The effect was predicted in the early 20th century.",
              "Its acceptance as a general physical phenomenon came mid-century.",
              "[8] Quantum tunnelling falls under the domain of quantum mechanics: the study of what happens at the quantum scale.",
              "Tunnelling cannot be directly perceived.",
              "Much of its understanding is shaped by the microscopic world, which classical mechanics cannot explain.",
              "To understand the phenomenon, particles attempting to travel across a potential barrier can be compared to a ball trying to roll over a hill.",
              "Quantum mechanics and classical mechanics differ in their treatment of this scenario.",
              "Classical mechanics predicts that particles that do not have enough energy to classically surmount a barrier cannot reach the other side.",
              "Thus, a ball without sufficient energy to surmount the hill would roll back down.",
              "In quantum mechanics, a particle can, with a small probability, tunnel to the other side, thus crossing the barrier.",
              "This tunnelling leaves the barrier unaffected (i.",
              "e. no hole is created in the barrier).",
              "The reason for this difference comes from treating matter as having properties of waves and particles.",
              "One interpretation of this duality involves the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which defines a limit on how precisely the position and the momentum of a particle can be simultaneously known.",
              "[9] This implies that no solutions have a probability of exactly zero (or one), though it may approach infinity.",
              "If, for example, the calculation for its position was taken as a probability of 1, its speed would have to be infinity (an impossibility).",
              "Hence, the probability of a given particle's existence on the opposite side of an intervening barrier is non-zero, and such particles will appear on the 'other' (a semantically difficult word in this instance) side in proportion to this probability.",
              "The wave function of a physical system of particles specifies everything that can be known about the system.",
              "[10] Therefore, problems in quantum mechanics analyze the system's wave function.",
              "Using mathematical formulations, such as the Schro\u0308dinger equation, the time evolution of a known wave function can be deduced.",
              "The square of the absolute value of this wave function is directly related to the probability distribution of the particle positions, which describes the probability that the particles would be measured at those positions.",
              "As shown in the animation, a wave packet impinges on the barrier, most of it is reflected and some is transmitted through the barrier.",
              "The wave packet becomes more de-localized: it is now on both sides of the barrier and lower in maximum amplitude, but equal in integrated square-magnitude, meaning that the probability the particle is somewhere remains unity.",
              "The wider the barrier and the higher the barrier energy, the lower the probability of tunneling.",
              "Some models of a tunneling barrier, such as the rectangular barriers shown, can be analysed and solved algebraically.",
              "[11]: 96 Most problems do not have an algebraic solution, so numerical solutions are used.",
              "\"Semiclassical methods\" offer approximate solutions that are easier to compute, such as the WKB approximation.",
              "The Schro\u0308dinger equation was published in 1926.",
              "The first person to apply the Schro\u0308dinger equation to a problem which involved tunneling between two classically allowed regions through a potential barrier was Friedrich Hund in a series of articles published in 1927.",
              "He studied the solutions of a double-well potential and discussed molecular spectra.",
              "[12] Leonid Mandelstam and Mikhail Leontovich discovered tunneling independently and published their results in 1928.",
              "[13] In 1927, Lothar Nordheim, assisted by Ralph Fowler, published a paper which discussed thermionic emission and reflection of electrons from metals.",
              "He assumed a surface potential barrier which confines the electrons within the metal and showed that the electrons have a finite probability of tunneling through or reflecting from the surface barrier when their energies are close to the barrier energy.",
              "Classically, the electron would either transmit or reflect with 100% certainty, depending on its energy.",
              "In 1928 J.",
              "Robert Oppenheimer published two papers on field emission, i.",
              "e. the emission of electrons induced by strong electric fields.",
              "Nordheim and Fowler simplified Oppenheimer's derivation and found values for the emitted currents and work functions which agreed with experiments.",
              "[12] A great success of the tunnelling theory was the mathematical explanation for alpha decay, which was developed in 1928 by George Gamow and independently by Ronald Gurney and Edward Condon.",
              "[14][15][16][17] The latter researchers simultaneously solved the Schro\u0308dinger equation for a model nuclear potential and derived a relationship between the half-life of the particle and the energy of emission that depended directly on the mathematical probability of tunneling.",
              "All three researchers were familiar with the works on field emission,[12] and Gamow was aware of Mandelstam and Leontovich's findings.",
              "[18] In the early days of quantum theory, the term tunnel effect was not used, and the effect was instead referred to as penetration of, or leaking through, a barrier.",
              "The german term wellenmechanische Tunneleffect was used in 1931 by Walter Schottky.",
              "The English term tunnel effect entered the language in 1932 when it was used by Yakov Frenkel in his textbook.",
              "[12] In 1957 Leo Esaki demonstrated tunneling of electrons over a few nanometer wide barrier in a semiconductor structure and developed a diode based on tunnel effect.",
              "[19] In 1960, following Esaki's work, Ivar Giaever showed experimentally that tunnelling also took place in superconductors.",
              "The tunnelling spectrum gave direct evidence of the superconducting energy gap.",
              "In 1962, Brian Josephson predicted the tunneling of superconducting Cooper pairs.",
              "Esaki, Giaever and Josephson shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics for their works on quantum tunneling in solids.",
              "[20][8] In 1981, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer developed a new type of microscope, called scanning tunneling microscope, which is based on tunnelling and is used for imaging surfaces at the atomic level.",
              "Binnig and Rohrer were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 for their discovery.",
              "[21] Tunnelling is the cause of some important macroscopic physical phenomena.",
              "Tunnelling is a source of current leakage in very-large-scale integration (VLSI) electronics and results in a substantial power drain and heating effects that plague such devices.",
              "It is considered the lower limit on how microelectronic device elements can be made.",
              "[22] Tunnelling is a fundamental technique used to program the floating gates of flash memory.",
              "Cold emission of electrons is relevant to semiconductors and superconductor physics.",
              "It is similar to thermionic emission, where electrons randomly jump from the surface of a metal to follow a voltage bias because they statistically end up with more energy than the barrier, through random collisions with other particles.",
              "When the electric field is very large, the barrier becomes thin enough for electrons to tunnel out of the atomic state, leading to a current that varies approximately exponentially with the electric field.",
              "[23] These materials are important for flash memory, vacuum tubes, as well as some electron microscopes.",
              "A simple barrier can be created by separating two conductors with a very thin insulator.",
              "These are tunnel junctions, the study of which requires understanding quantum tunnelling.",
              "[24] Josephson junctions take advantage of quantum tunnelling and superconductivity to create the Josephson effect.",
              "This has applications in precision measurements of voltages and magnetic fields,[23] as well as the multijunction solar cell.",
              "Diodes are electrical semiconductor devices that allow electric current flow in one direction more than the other.",
              "The device depends on a depletion layer between N-type and P-type semiconductors to serve its purpose.",
              "When these are heavily doped the depletion layer can be thin enough for tunnelling.",
              "When a small forward bias is applied, the current due to tunnelling is significant.",
              "This has a maximum at the point where the voltage bias is such that the energy level of the p and n conduction bands are the same.",
              "As the voltage bias is increased, the two conduction bands no longer line up and the diode acts typically.",
              "[25] Because the tunnelling current drops off rapidly, tunnel diodes can be created that have a range of voltages for which current decreases as voltage increases.",
              "This peculiar property is used in some applications, such as high speed devices where the characteristic tunnelling probability changes as rapidly as the bias voltage.",
              "[25] The resonant tunnelling diode makes use of quantum tunnelling in a very different manner to achieve a similar result.",
              "This diode has a resonant voltage for which a current favors a particular voltage, achieved by placing two thin layers with a high energy conductance band near each other.",
              "This creates a quantum potential well that has a discrete lowest energy level.",
              "When this energy level is higher than that of the electrons, no tunnelling occurs and the diode is in reverse bias.",
              "Once the two voltage energies align, the electrons flow like an open wire.",
              "As the voltage further increases, tunnelling becomes improbable and the diode acts like a normal diode again before a second energy level becomes noticeable.",
              "[26] A European research project demonstrated field effect transistors in which the gate (channel) is controlled via quantum tunnelling rather than by thermal injection, reducing gate voltage from \u22481 volt to 0.",
              "2 volts and reducing power consumption by up to 100\u00d7.",
              "If these transistors can be scaled up into VLSI chips, they would improve the performance per power of integrated circuits.",
              "[27][28] While the Drude-Lorentz model of electrical conductivity makes excellent predictions about the nature of electrons conducting in metals, it can be furthered by using quantum tunnelling to explain the nature of the electron's collisions.",
              "[23] When a free electron wave packet encounters a long array of uniformly spaced barriers, the reflected part of the wave packet interferes uniformly with the transmitted one between all barriers so that 100% transmission becomes possible.",
              "The theory predicts that if positively charged nuclei form a perfectly rectangular array, electrons will tunnel through the metal as free electrons, leading to extremely high conductance, and that impurities in the metal will disrupt it.",
              "[23] The scanning tunnelling microscope (STM), invented by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, may allow imaging of individual atoms on the surface of a material.",
              "[23] It operates by taking advantage of the relationship between quantum tunnelling with distance.",
              "When the tip of the STM's needle is brought close to a conduction surface that has a voltage bias, measuring the current of electrons that are tunnelling between the needle and the surface reveals the distance between the needle and the surface.",
              "By using piezoelectric rods that change in size when voltage is applied, the height of the tip can be adjusted to keep the tunnelling current constant.",
              "The time-varying voltages that are applied to these rods can be recorded and used to image the surface of the conductor.",
              "[23] STMs are accurate to 0.",
              "001 nm, or about 1% of atomic diameter.",
              "[26] Quantum tunnelling is an essential phenomenon for nuclear fusion.",
              "The temperature in stellar cores is generally insufficient to allow atomic nuclei to overcome the Coulomb barrier and achieve thermonuclear fusion.",
              "Quantum tunnelling increases the probability of penetrating this barrier.",
              "Though this probability is still low, the extremely large number of nuclei in the core of a star is sufficient to sustain a steady fusion reaction.",
              "[29] Radioactive decay is the process of emission of particles and energy from the unstable nucleus of an atom to form a stable product.",
              "This is done via the tunnelling of a particle out of the nucleus (an electron tunneling into the nucleus is electron capture).",
              "This was the first application of quantum tunnelling.",
              "Radioactive decay is a relevant issue for astrobiology as this consequence of quantum tunnelling creates a constant energy source over a large time interval for environments outside the circumstellar habitable zone where insolation would not be possible (subsurface oceans) or effective.",
              "[29] Quantum tunnelling may be one of the mechanisms of hypothetical proton decay.",
              "[30][31] In chemical kinetics, the substitution of a light isotope of an element with a heavier one typically results in a slower reaction rate.",

              "Tunneling is a consequence of the wave nature of matter, where the quantum wave function describes the state of a particle or other physical system, and wave equations such as the Schro\u0308dinger equation describe their behavior.",
              "The probability of transmission of a wave packet through a barrier decreases exponentially with the barrier height, the barrier width, and the tunneling particle's mass, so tunneling is seen most prominently in low-mass particles such as electrons or protons tunneling through microscopically narrow barriers.",

              "1 nm or smaller for heavier particles such as protons or hydrogen atoms.[1] Some sources describe the mere penetration of a wave function into the barrier, without transmission on the other side, as a tunneling effect, such as in tunneling into the walls of a finite potential well.",

              "Tunneling limits the minimum size of devices used in microelectronics because electrons tunnel readily through insulating layers and transistors that are thinner than about 1 nm.",
              "[6][7] The effect was predicted in the early 20th century.",
              "Its acceptance as a general physical phenomenon came mid-century.",

              "Much of its understanding is shaped by the microscopic world, which classical mechanics cannot explain.",
              "To understand the phenomenon, particles attempting to travel across a potential barrier can be compared to a ball trying to roll over a hill.",

              "If, for example, the calculation for its position was taken as a probability of 1, its speed would have to be infinity (an impossibility).",
              "Hence, the probability of a given particle's existence on the opposite side of an intervening barrier is non-zero, and such particles will appear on the 'other' (a semantically difficult word in this instance) side in proportion to this probability.",

              "In the situation represented in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{4}\\), where the external electric field is uniform and has magnitude \\(E_g\\), if an electron happens to be outside the conductor at a distance x away from its surface, its potential energy would have to be \\(U(x) = -eE_gx\\) (here, x denotes distance to the surface).",
              "Taking the origin at the surface, so that \\(x = 0\\) is the location of the surface, we can represent the potential energy of conduction electrons in a metal as the potential energy barrier shown in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{5}\\).",
