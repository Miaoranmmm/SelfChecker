    "query": "What are the key principles and best practices for creating an effective and engaging online learning experience, and how can educators adapt their teaching strategies to optimize this medium for student success?",
    "response": "That's a great question. Creating an effective and engaging online learning experience can be challenging, but there are some key principles and best practices that can help educators adapt their teaching strategies to optimize this medium for student success. Here are some of them:\n\n- **Explicitly teach expectations and engagement**. Video and distance learning is a totally different medium of teaching and learning. Both you and your students may need time and support to learn how to use the technology, access the materials, and interact effectively in this space. Co-create and share clear expectations for how to engage in this learning environment, and give opportunities for practice and feedback[^1^].\n- **Allow for asynchronous learning**. Some of your students may not be able to watch a livestream, whether it\u2019s due to timing, internet access, or the ability to focus on a lesson via a videoconference. And some students have trouble processing information when it\u2019s presented only in auditory form. If you\u2019re delivering live instruction via video, record it for students to review or access later. You can also provide transcripts, captions, or other alternative formats for your audio content[^1^].\n- **Assign note-takers**. It\u2019s harder for many students to \u201cwatch\u201d instruction via video livestream than in a live classroom. It can be challenging to focus, feel connected, process information, and identify key ideas. Older students (middle-schoolers and high-schoolers) can work together to help each other. Consider assigning students to take notes for the class using collaborative tools like Google Docs or Miro[^1^].\n- **Make materials accessible**. Ensure that your online materials are compatible with assistive technologies, such as screen readers, magnifiers, or speech-to-text software. Use clear fonts, colors, and layouts that are easy to read and navigate. Provide multiple ways for students to access and demonstrate their learning, such as text, audio, video, images, quizzes, etc[^1^].\n- **Embrace your students as teachers**. One of the benefits of online learning is that it can foster more student autonomy and collaboration. Encourage your students to share their expertise, interests, and experiences with each other. For example, you can ask them to create videos, podcasts, blogs, or presentations on topics related to the course content and give feedback to their peers[^1^].\n- **Actively build a supportive community**. Online learning can feel isolating and impersonal for both students and teachers. It\u2019s important to create a sense of belonging and connection among your online learners. You can do this by using icebreakers, polls, surveys, games, or other activities that help students get to know each other and you. You can also use chat sites, discussion forums, breakout rooms, or other tools that facilitate student-to-student communication[^2^].\n- **Focus on your pedagogy, not the medium**. The basis of teaching is the same for every modality: strong emphases on content, pedagogy, and assessment. Careful planning on these three factors remains central to successful teaching - both residential and online. The forms of teaching interaction may change: even as the online instruction often precludes certain forms of in-person contact, it creates opportunities for new ways to interact[^2^]. Well-planned,\nintentional uses of online technologies can encourage and facilitate even more \u201clean forward\u201d behaviors and more interaction with and among students[^2^].\n- **Make your learning stick**. To get the most out of online learning, make sure you develop new knowledge and skills in a way that you can retain, apply repeatedly, and adapt to new contexts. Make your learning stick by taking advantage of the established learning science principles of practice,\napplication, and reflection[^5^]. For example, you can use spaced repetition,\ninterleaving,\nelaboration,\nretrieval practice,\nand metacognition\nto enhance your online learning experience[^5^].\n\nI hope this helps you understand some of the key principles and best practices for creating an effective and engaging online learning experience.",

              "Challenges in the learning process are however, particularly difficult to detect and respond to in educational environments where growing class sizes and the increased use of digital technologies mean that teachers are unable to provide nuanced and personalized feedback and support to help students overcome their difficulties.",
              "Individual differences, the specifics of the learning activity, and the difficulty of giving individual feedback in large classes and digital environments all add to the challenge of responding to student difficulties and confusion.",

              "We conclude with a theoretical model of the zones of optimal and sub-optimal confusion as a way of conceptualizing the parameters of productive and non-productive difficulties experienced by students while they learn.",
              "As class sizes in education are increasing and technology is impacting on education at all levels, these trends create significant challenges for teachers as they attempt to support individual students.",
              "Technology undoubtedly provides substantial advantages for students, enabling them to access information from around the planet easily and at any time.",
              "The advantages and disadvantages of the increased use of technology have come to light over time as students increasingly engage with new innovations.",
              "In this review, we will address an issue that has become progressively evident in digital learning environments but is relevant to all educational settings, particularly as class sizes grow.",
              "We will explore the difficulties in attempting to understand and account for the struggles students experience while learning a particular emphasis on what happens when students experience difficulties and become confused.",
              "Running into problems while learning is often accompanied by an emotional response.",
              "Emotion, more broadly, plays a vital role in the integration of new knowledge with prior knowledge.",

              ", 1987), and applied educational studies (e.",
              "g., Pekrun, 2005).",
              "A clear example of how emotion can impact on the learning process is where it creates an obstacle to learning, reflected in, for example, the vast body of work that has examined the detrimental effect of anxiety on the learning of mathematics (Hembree, 1990).",
              "Similarly, confusion has been associated with blockages or impasses in the learning process (Kennedy and Lodge, 2016).",
              "Despite its importance, understanding, identifying and responding to difficulties and the resulting emotions in learning can be problematic, particularly in larger classes and in digital environments.",
              "Without the affordances of synchronous face-to-face human interaction in digital environments, emotions like confusion are difficult to detect.",
              "It is therefore challenging to respond to students with support or feedback to help their progress when they are stuck and become confused.",
              "Humans are uniquely tuned to respond to the emotional reactions of other humans (Damasio, 1994).",
              "Intuitively we know what it is like to feel confused as a result of a difficulty in the learning process, yet confusion is not regarded as one of the \u201cbasic\u201d emotions: like, for example, happiness, sadness, and anger (Ekman, 2008).",
              "And while student confusion is relatively easy for an experienced teacher to detect in face-to-face settings (Lepper and Woolverton, 2002), it is a complex emotion that is difficult to explain scientifically (Silvia, 2010;",
              "Pekrun and Stephens, 2011).",
              "But we know that confusion is both commonly felt by students, is able to be diagnosed by teachers, and able to be resolved productively with teacher support (see for example, Lehman et al.",
              ", 2008).",
              "Thus, at the most fundamental level, confusion is both widely experienced and relatively easily detected by teachers, despite the uncertainty about the exact relationship between difficulties and emotional responses in learning.",
              "Thus, student emotions, such as confusion, are relatively straightforward for experienced teachers to detect, understand and respond to in face-to-face settings with relatively small class sizes (see Woolfolk and Brooks, 1983;",
              "Woolf et al.",
              ", 2009;",
              "Mainhard et al.",
              ", 2018).",
              "The same is not true in digital environments or large classes.",
              "Emotions are less obvious to teachers when there are many students or when they interact with students via electronic methods (Wosnitza and Volet, 2005).",
              "This means that alternate practices are needed to respond to students when they experience difficulties in these emerging environments.",
              "The increased difficulty in detecting and responding to student emotions is one of several key reasons why a deeper understanding of difficulties and associated emotional responses is needed as new technologies and increasing class sizes impact education.",
              "Digital learning environments, especially online or distance learning environments, are often explicitly designed so that students will have flexibility and autonomy in their studies.",
              "Students, when studying online or at a distance, are often able to access course material and resources in their own time (and place) and are often not constrained by centralized timetables.",
              "As a result, there is often a greater onus on students in these environments to be more autonomous and self-directed in their learning (Huang, 2002).",
              "Thus, increased learning flexibility often leads to students having fewer opportunities for engaging with teaching staff and receiving feedback in real time (Mansour and Mupinga, 2007).",
              "While activities can be made available in the form of webinars and other synchronous formats, there remains a substantial responsibility on students to be autonomous and make good decisions about their own progress without requiring the real-time intervention of teaching staff.",
              "Digital learning environments that largely provide self-directed students with autonomy and flexibility can potentially be created to detect and respond to student difficulties, but this potential has not yet been realized (Arguel et al.",
              ", 2017).",
              "A key challenge for educational technology researchers and educators is to create digital environments that are better able to provide support for and potentially respond to difficulties and the resulting emotions such as confusion, without the requirement of having a teacher on-call to support students.",
              "For this to occur, sophisticated digital learning environments need to be created that can support students in their autonomous, personalized and self-directed learning and provide feedback that in some way, emulates what a teacher does in more traditional, face-to-face settings.",
              "In order for a digital learning environment to be responsive to difficulties\u2014or indeed to other emotions that impact on learning\u2014it is necessary for the system to detect the emotions that students experience during their learning (Arguel et al.",
              ", 2017).",
              "These emotional responses are the key indicator teachers use in face-to-face settings to determine when students are having problems. Given the difficulty of identifying emotions in digital learning environments in ways that humans can in face-to-face environments, this is a particularly vexing issue and one that has led to the growth of the burgeoning field of affective computing (Picard, 2000).",
              "A second requirement is that digital learning environments need to be reactive to emotional responses such as confusion once these responses have been detected.",
              "For example, it would be useful if confused learners were given system-generated, programmed support to help them resolve their difficulties within the environment itself.",
              "Without a teacher present and without any automated support, it is possible that a student may succumb to their confusion, get frustrated and, as a result, disengage entirely (D'Mello and Graesser, 2014).",
              "While it is difficult enough to determine when students become confused in these environments, it is even more complex to know when and how to intervene to prevent the confusion from becoming boredom or frustration.",
              "Finally, it would be a distinct advantage if any response or feedback that a digital learning environment provided a confused student could be tailored and personalized to the individual student and their learning pathway, progress and process (Lodge, 2018).",
              "Teachers are able to quickly adapt to an individual student's emotional responses in a classroom in smaller classes.",
              "This enables teachers to intervene with individualized, customized assistance and feedback for students, which can help them manage both their emotions and their approach to the particular learning activity they are finding confusing.",
              "Effective intervention represents a significant challenge for designers of digital learning environments as teachers are adept at responding to student emotions in nuanced and personalized ways that are not easily programmed into a digital system.",
              "Taken together, it is apparent that the increased use of digital learning environments has created a need for better understanding and intervening when students experience difficulties and become confused.",
              "This situation is, however, not helped by ongoing conjecture in the literature as to whether difficulties in the learning process resulting in confusion are detrimental or beneficial for learning (Arguel et al.",
              ", 2017).",
              "For example, Dweck (1986) argues that confusion is consistently detrimental to learning and is mediated by prior achievement, IQ scores, and confidence.",
              "She suggests that students who have poor prior achievement and confidence are at risk of attributing the experience of reaching a learning impasse and their resulting emotional response to their lack of aptitude.",
              "That is, students who become confused while completing a learning activity may interpret their confusion as a sign that they are incapable of learning the material.",
              "This argument aligns with a body of literature showing that persistent confusion can lead to frustration and boredom, which as a result has a negative impact on learning (D'Mello and Graesser, 2014).",
              "More recently, however, research has suggested that difficulties resulting in confusion can benefit student learning.",
              "This is perhaps best exemplified in the research on what have been labeled \u201cdesirable difficulties\u201d (Bjork and Bjork, 2011), specific features of the learning situation that introduce beneficial difficulties that reliably enhance learning.",
              "Along similar lines, D'Mello et al.",
              "(2014) found that inducing difficulties and confusion in an intelligent tutoring system appeared to enhance learning.",
              "Moreover, some research has indicated that difficulties may be particularly beneficial for conceptual learning, where students sometimes need to overcome misconceptions before developing a more sophisticated understanding of the topic area (Kennedy and Lodge, 2016).",
              "For example, Chen et al.",
              "(2013) developed a predict-observe-explain activity about commonly misconceived notions in electronics.",
              "Conflicting information was presented to students in the form of scenarios and the resulting confusion, when resolved, appeared to enhance student learning, particularly in relation to correcting the misconceptions.",
              "What is apparent from this research is that there seems to be a complex mix of factors that lead to students experiencing difficulties and uncertainty about what kinds of outcomes occur as a result.",
              "The factors vary between students and the kinds of difficulties faced will differ across knowledge domains and task types.",
              "From these few studies it is evident that experiencing difficulties and confusion might be beneficial for different students under different circumstances and that the role of confusion in productive learning is important to understand across different learning environments, knowledge domains, and types of learning activities.",
              "Dweck's (1986) work indicates that confusion may be interpreted, managed and adapted to in different ways by students depending on their levels of confidence and past achievements.",
              "On the other hand, the work of D'Mello et al.",
              "(2014) and Chen et al.",
              "(2013) suggests that confusion can help students' learning, particularly when conceptual learning or conceptual change is the aim of the activity.",
              "In this integrative review, we examine the literature on difficulties in learning.",
              "We focus here on the ways in which it might be possible to detect confusion experienced as a result of difficulties and intervene when students are counterproductively confused.",
              "Our aim is to explore the ways in which the difficulties students experience in learning could be harnessed for the purpose of enhancing their education.",
              "If digital learning environments are to reach their potential, they must be designed in a way to enable sophisticated support and feedback to confused students, in ways that are similar to those a teacher can provide in small group face-to-face settings.",
              "While confusion is common in educational practice and learning research, generally speaking, it has been poorly defined and understood in the educational literature (Silvia, 2010).",
              "Confusion is often associated with reaching a cognitive impasse or \u201cbeing stuck\u201d while trying to learn something new (Woolf et al.",
              ", 2009), and it is also commonly regarded as a negative emotional experience or something to be avoided while learning (\u201cMiss, help me, I am confused!",
              "\u201d;",
              "see also Kort et al.",
              ", 2001).",
              "Both of these aspects of confusion\u2014being stuck and a feeling to be avoided\u2014have perhaps led to the everyday notion that confusion is detrimental to learning.",
              "While there is certainly research that suggests when confusion persists to the point of frustration, it commonly leads to negative outcomes and has a detrimental impact on understanding (Dweck, 1986;",
              "D'Mello and Graesser, 2011), as mentioned above, there are times when it may be beneficial to experience a cognitive impasse and the feeling of confusion when learning.",
              "When it comes to defining what confusion actually is, there has been some ambiguity as to the extent to which it is a cognitive or emotional phenomenon (D'Mello and Graesser, 2014).",
              "This uncertainty stems from debates about whether or not emotions such as confusion require some element of interpretation in order for the subjective experience of the emotion to take form.",
              "These views are derived from an attributional perspective on emotion (Schachter and Singer, 1962).",
              "The process, according to this perspective, is that confusion is the result of an individual's attribution of an affective response to a preceding subjective experience.",
              "In other words, the student reaches an impasse that causes them some difficulty.",
              "As a result of the impasse, the student has some sort of emotional response to the situation they find themselves in.",
              "That emotional response is then interpreted by the individual\u2014they attribute meaning to it\u2014which may be confusion (or anxiety, or excitement).",
              "In this way, the individual experiences or \u201cattributes\u201d the emotion of confusion to the impasse.",
              "This interpretation is particularly important given that confusion in learning needs to be about some educational material attempting to be understood by a student (Silvia, 2010).",
              "However, the attributional process also suggests that there are substantial differences between individuals in terms of the attributions they make.",
              "Two students can experience the exact same educational conditions and interpret them in vastly different ways, leading one to be confused while the other experiences no such response.",
              "The interaction between subjective experience and content knowledge has led to confusion being defined as an \u201cepistemic emotion\u201d (Pekrun and Stephens, 2011).",
              "In other words, confusion can be defined as an affective response that occurs in relation to how people come to know or understand something.",
              "When defined as an epistemic emotion, confusion is considered to have both cognitive and affective components.",
              "While it is reasonably clear that confusion has both cognitive and affective components, what is less obvious is whether difficulties in learning that result in confusion are productive or unproductive in learning.",
              "The literature in this area is somewhat equivocal.",

              "Two virtual agents were used in the intelligent tutoring system to present information about the topic.",
              "In the confusion condition, the information from the two agents was contradictory and thus confusing for students.",

              "Regarding the students\u2019 self-reported learning gains, synchronicity of the online setting seems to be of minor importance: While unsurprisingly, a majority of students reported improving their digital skills \u2013 as did more than 80% of the teachers \u2013 there was no difference between synchronous and asynchronous settings.",
              "Likewise, students self-reported learning gains did not significantly differ with regard to content-related skills and vocational skills.",
              "However, students who experienced mostly asynchronous teaching report greater gains in autonomous learning and smaller gains in social skills, both results being immediately plausible since asynchronous settings are characterized by high degrees of autonomy and fewer possibilities for social exchange.",

              "With more time for thorough course planning, teachers have the possibility to incorporate intelligent opportunities for both teacher-student and student\u2013student interactions and collaboration into their online courses (Alqurashi, 2019).",
              "In this sense, results should be used to optimize both types of learning arrangements and allow for their purposeful use.",

              "The differences between synchronous and asynchronous settings stress the importance of the support of relatedness (see also Chiu, 2021), to make up for the disadvantages that go along with asynchronous settings.",
              "Similar to the results by Hsu et al.",
              "(2019), we also found that needs fulfillment were positively correlated with all of the facets of self-reported competence gain.",
              "Together with the results from our second research question, this indicates that the satisfaction of basic psychological needs enhances students\u2019 learning experience comprising higher satisfaction, less procrastination, and greater learning gains.",

              "Aside from synchronicity, we also found a positive correlation between autonomy support and the PEOU of technology.",
              "It could be argued that through this, also the interaction with online learning content could be eased, resulting in the experience of more autonomy support.",
              "With these results, this study contributes to the existing evidence for the application of SDT in online learning and it provides a good starting point for theoretical and practical implications.",
              "Even though SDT-related results in this study may suggest that synchronous settings outperform asynchronous settings, there are many good reasons why higher education should not completely abandon asynchronous teaching and learning.",
              "In the correlative results, we found strong associations between the perceived usefulness of given online tools and a positive learning experience, implying that teachers in general should allow their students to experience the usefulness of the chosen tools.",
              "Several limitations of the current study should be noted.",
              "As many other studies on experiences with remote learning due to the pandemic, the results rely on data that are derived from a single German university;",
              "therefore, the results can only be generalized to a limited extent.",
              "However, the university is large and includes a wide variety of disciplines and study programs. Universities in Germany are equipped similarly when it comes to basic infrastructure and the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic created a comparable interruption of regular teaching and learning for everyone.",
              "Therefore, we assume that results should be transferrable, at least for the German context.",
              "The relatively low response rate might also have resulted in a self-selection bias of students and teachers with regard to possible systematic differences to the non-responding groups.",
              "The representativeness for the faculties still is encouraging as well as the variance in variables\u2019 scores.",
              "Also, the SDT describes the needs as universal across individuals (Deci and Ryan, 2000).",
              "From this point of view, the aggregation of data across courses and disciplines as well as grouping teachers and students according to the synchronicity of online learning can compensate the absence of matching between student and teacher samples on the course level.",
              "Another challenge is the quality of data, in regard to known problems of self-report measures, which are susceptible to memory distortions and do not equal actual performance (Schellings and van Hout-Wolters, 2011).",
              "And while, as mentioned by Pekrun (2020), self-reports can deliver data of high validity in investigating motivational, cognitive, or emotional aspects of learning but they should be enhanced by other data sources.",
              "Albeit the validity of the data was partially increased be integrating responses from teacher survey and student survey \u2013 allowing to some extent the cross verification of the findings from teacher and student perspectives, it would still be desirable in the sense of data triangulation for future research to integrate other sources of data related to online learning.",
              "These could include, for example, the frequency and real-time use of LMS, chats, or videoconferencing as well as the number of downloads of recorded lectures or podcasts.",
              "Another possibility of data triangulation could be a better integration of qualitative data in addition to quantitative data enabling stronger validation of results.",
              "As a further limitation, it should be mentioned that in student evaluations of teaching, high intercorrelations are well-known, indicating a central factor that influences a student\u2019s evaluation of the lecturer (Shevlin et al.",
              ", 2000).",
              "Still, self-reports provide an opportunity for insight into cognitive, motivational, and behavioral processes on a broad level that can help to detect systematic correlations.",
              "Another limitation is the instruments used for this study: Scales had to be shortened in order to be included in the comprehensive student and teacher survey.",
              "Some information had to be collected through single-item measures.",
              "However, the internal consistencies of scales applied were good or very good and therefore ensure a certain psychometric quality.",
              "A general challenge of one-shot studies is that they only have a correlational scope and do not allow causal relationships to be established even if the theoretical assumptions suggest them.",
              "And while we were able to harness data from both the student and teacher surveys, we are unable to link both data sources so we do not know whether potential differential effects are covered.",
              "All of these limitations connote future research strategies, where, for example, fewer courses are researched in more depth.",
              "Overall, our findings contribute to theory because they further indicate that the synchronous and asynchronous settings are no uniform environments but offer a variety of different options for teaching and learning.",
              "Also, our results offer evidence for an association between these settings and prerequisites for student engagement and indicators for satisfaction and learning behavior and perceived learning outcomes.",
              "Our research focused on teaching and learning during the 2020 lockdown, but even if the post-COVID classroom will differ from the ad hoc circumstances experienced during the first lockdown, the experience has produced a vast amount of insights into opportunities, potentials and risks of digitally organized learning (Aristovnik et al.",
              ", 2020).",
              "These highly valuable first-hand experiences with online teaching and learning under real life conditions need to be integrated with existing findings from systematic research on online learning to help to refine future higher education online teaching and learning.",
              "However, it should be kept in mind that cultural differences might affect learning experience when interpreting findings that stem from specific national contexts (Chiu, 2021).",
              "We have found SDT to serve as a valuable model in interpreting results, and we would encourage further research to add to empirical evidence of SDT in higher education and specifically in online learning.",
              "The universal necessity to engage with online learning for the majority of teachers and students was challenging, but further strengthened the topic not only for those with a specific interest in digital media.",
              "Besides the boost in digital skills for students and teachers (and most likely for universities as institutions as well), it has become even more obvious that teaching in higher education should support active learner-centered learning, especially for online settings.",
              "The purposeful and intentional use of technologies to allow for adaptive and fair learning opportunities in higher education is of ongoing and even growing importance.",
              "It is upon teachers to successfully implement online tools into their teaching and to develop teaching and learning arrangements with tools that serve a transparent purpose and also do not neglect student interactions with teachers, as well as with fellow students and with content.",
              "With asynchronous teaching formats in particular, we conclude that teachers need to put extra effort into providing sufficient opportunities for students to interact not only with the learning content but also with the teacher and their fellow students.",
              "Online settings of teaching and learning hold potential, not only for self-pacing studying, but also for flipped learning arrangements, adaptivity for individual needs, cooperative tasks like wikis or blogs and for automated assessments.",
              "All of this should be accompanied by continuous support, not only for technical issues but also for quality teaching and learning in online environments.",
              "Therefore, teachers need to be empowered to make the most of digital advances (OECD, 2020) while having enough room to autonomously make their own decisions and relate to others in this process (Moorhouse and Kohnke, 2021).",

              "When the COVID-19 pandemic forced me to move my courses online, I recorded my synchronous online class sessions so students could review them later.",
              "However, student feedback and reflection on my course goals revealed collaborative note-taking as an alternative way to provide a record of each class session.",
              "My first indication that recording class sessions might be problematic came halfway through the semester.",
              "One of my students, a first-generation student, I\u2019ll call Erica, approached me to discuss her performance in the course.",
              "I was surprised to hear that Erica felt she was underperforming in class because she was consistently turning in excellent work.",
              "However, Erica thought that the class discussion revealed that other students had a deeper understanding of the material than she had.",
              "I had noticed that she did not regularly speak up during class discussions and suggested that receiving feedback on her thoughts would improve her confidence.",
              "She agreed, but confessed that participating in class was difficult for her because the class was being recorded.",
              "She did not like the idea that if she were to say something \u201cstupid,\u201d everyone in the class would watch it on the recording.",
              "I had a similar conversation with another student in the course, a Black student who I\u2019ll call James.",
              "In a previous face-to-face course, James was highly engaged and a regular contributor in class discussions.",
              "However, in the online environment, he rarely spoke up during class.",
              "I reached out to James to talk about his experience in the course.",
              "Like Erica, he shared similar feelings of inadequacy.",
              "He recognized that he wasn\u2019t speaking up in class as often as usual but admitted that being recorded made him worry about having a \u201cdumb mistake\u201d get recorded.",
              "Erica and James\u2019 comments reminded me of Uri Treisman\u2019s case study on Black math students that Claude Steele writes about in Whistling Vivaldi.",
              "According to Steele, Treisman observed that Black students, unlike their white and Asian peers, were intensely private about their work.",
              "They tended to study alone and did not talk about coursework outside of the course.",
              "This lack of feedback from other students often led students to feeling inadequate and made them rethink their fit in the university environment.",
              "Other researchers have reported these same feelings of isolation in first generation students of all races (Terenzini, Springer, Yaeger, Pascarella, and Amaury, 1996).",
              "Online learning environments can naturally increase students\u2019 feelings of aloneness and isolation (Palloff & Pratt, 1999).",
              "What Erica and James told me was that, for them, being recorded increased their feelings of isolation and inadequacy.",
              "Erica and James revealed the potential harm recording class sessions could have.",
              "Importantly, this potential harm was not outweighed by any benefit: Students indicated that they rarely, if ever, watched the recorded sessions.",
              "I searched for alternatives to providing a recorded session and instead, implemented collaborative note-taking (Harbin, 2020), which I am now using for the second semester.",
              "In collaborative note-taking, students work together to provide a set of notes to share with the entire class.",
              "For each class session, I assign two students the task of taking notes.",
              "During class, note takers record their notes in a Google doc that I create ahead of time.",
              "After class, they are given an additional 24 hours to clean up the notes before the document is posted to our LMS.",
              "I assign note-taking pairs based on students\u2019 assessments of their own ability to take notes during class.",
              "The rest of the students in the course are expected to continue taking their own notes during class and are allowed to make suggestions for additions to the notes.",
              "In addition to providing a written record of the class session, collaborative note-taking better supports my goal of creating a learning community.",
              "Collaborative note-taking signals that students should take an active role in their peers\u2019 successes as well as their own.",
              "Additionally, because I monitor the document during class, collaborative note-taking provides me with a mechanism for checking in on students\u2019 understanding, something that I\u2019ve found challenging in the online-learning environment.",
              "Finally, collaborative note-taking better supports my goal of creating an inclusive learning environment.",
              "Adopting this practice requires that I spend more time talking about note-taking strategies than I typically do.",
              "This supports students who come in with less developed note-taking skills than other students.",
              "Initially, I was worried that students might be overwhelmed by the task, however, they reported that being a note taker was not disruptive.",
              "They enjoyed the task and took ownership over the activity.",
              "Each of my classes developed their own ways to ensure the process was useful and manageable.",
              "For example, one class chose to use different font colors for the things that I said and things that other students said.",
              "To make following along more manageable, they decided that one of the note takers would be responsible for tracking me, while the other would record student comments.",
              "A few students could not take notes during class for various reasons (e.",
              "g., some devices make toggling between a document and Zoom difficult).",
              "However, the class decided that those students could act as the \u201ceditor\u201d and be responsible for cleaning up the notes after class ended.",
              "Collaborative note-taking might not work for all course types and some material does benefit from repeated viewings.",
              "For example, when I present skill-based material, such as APA formatting or computing statistics, I record those sessions.",
              "As a final note, all of the students appreciated having a set of class notes and reported referring to the class notes often.",
              "A few students admitted to being especially appreciative because they rarely asked their peers for a copy of their notes if they missed class.",
              "Importantly, because the notes were posted after class and did not record participants\u2019 names, students were not discouraged to participate in class.",

              "By Sheryl Burgstahler With their rush to move instruction online in response to the world-wide pandemic of 2020, some instructors and course designers have inadvertently left some students out of many learning activities because they have not employed well-established inclusive practices.",
              "These students include those who have disabilities that impact their abilities to see, hear, move, learn, and engage.",
              "The instructional materials below provide a path forward in improving existing offerings and designing new ones that ensure that all students can benefit from online educational opportunities.",

              "I share tips for the inclusive design of online learning that have evolved from my efforts to teach courses that are accessible to all of my students, as well as from the experiences of colleagues who have done the same.",
              "This tutorial covers these topics and more: I also include links to resources for further learning that include technical details and issues relevant to making your online course inclusive of all of your students who may be enrolled now or in the future.",
              "So what do I mean by an \u201cinclusive\u201d online course?",
              "I mean a course designed so that anyone who meets requirements, with or without accommodations, will Simple, right?",
              "Absolutely.",
              "However, it is easier to set a goal of inclusiveness than to really make it happen.",
              "And, for me, creating a completely inclusive course without the need for some accommodation has always been a goal that I have never quite reached.",
              "Luckily, inclusive design can be implemented incrementally if you adopt a habit of continuous course improvement.",
              "One motivator for accessible design of online learning is that educational institutions have been presented with legal challenges from the US Department of Education Office of Civil Rights, the Department of Justice, and the court system with respect to the inaccessible design of IT they use, including IT used to deliver online learning.",
              "Schools presented with formal civil rights complaints represent a diverse group of institutions, as represented by this small sample: University of Cincinnati, Youngstown State University, University of Colorado-Boulder, University of Montana-Missoula, UC Berkeley, South Carolina Technical College System , Louisiana Tech University, MIT, Maricopa Community College District, Florida State University, CSU Fullerton, California Community Colleges, Ohio State University: University of Kentucky, and Harvard University.",
              "This is a club to which I hope we, at the University of Washington, will never belong.",
              "The resolutions with the US federal government to the civil rights complaints about inaccessible IT that campuses have received point to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and its 2008 Amendments as their legal basis.",
              "If you would like to receive guidance regarding issues that postsecondary institutions should address in order to minimize the likelihood of a civil rights complaint about accessible IT, consult EDUCAUSE's IT Accessibility Risk Statements and Evidence.",
              "In the context of resolutions to civil rights complaints in the US, \u201caccessible\u201d IT means \"a person with a disability is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services as a person without a disability in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use.",
              "The person with a disability must be able to obtain the information as fully, equally, and independently as a person without a disability.\"",
              "Traditional efforts to assist students with disabilities on campuses nationwide embrace a \u201cmedical model\u201d of disability, where focus is on the \u201cdeficit\u201d of the individual and how the person can be rehabilitated or how accommodations can be made so that they can fit into an established environment.",
              "An accommodation adjusts a product or environment to provide access to a specific person with a disability.",
              "These are examples of accommodations: I always anticipate that students interacting in my online course will have diverse characteristics.",
              "My course may include students who fall into the following demographics: While there are many assistive technologies (ATs) and other accommodations that allow students with disabilities to access IT and teaching practices used in your course, the good news is you do not need to have a depth of knowledge about AT in order to design accessible content pages, document, and videos for your course.",
              "Instead, you can be guided by AT limitations to determine how to design mainstream technologies so that individuals with disabilities using AT can access them.",
              "Some basic limitations are summarized in the following table.",
              "[OPTIONAL] If you would like to learn more about ATs students with disabilities in your course might be using, I suggest you start by viewing these videos: Accommodations will likely always be necessary in specific circumstances\u2014e.",
              "g., extra time on tests, sign language interpreters, live captioning for synchronous events.",
              "However, I recommend that more attention be paid to the design of the product or environment itself.",
              "To make this point, consider the following \"Coffeepot for Masochists\" from the Catalog of Unfindable Objects by Jacques Carelman in Donald Norman's The Psychology of Everyday Things, 1988.",
              "Not many people could efficiently and safely poor coffee from this pot, which has the spout and the handle on the same side.",
              "I doubt that many of us would think that trying to simply modify this product so that it is more usable would be a worthwhile use of time.",
              "Instead, I think most of us would agree that the product itself should be re-designed so that it can be used by everyone who needs to use it.",
              "Similarly, when it comes to students with disabilities in online learning settings, simply providing accommodations when individuals with disabilities experience access challenges may lead to inefficiencies.",
              "The \u201csocial model\u201d of disability and other integrated approaches within the field of disability studies consider variations in abilities\u2014like those with respect to gender, race, and ethnicity\u2014a natural part of the human experience.",
              "This view suggests that more attention should be devoted to designing products and environments\u2014including courses, technology, and student services\u2014that are welcoming and accessible to everyone who might register in a course.",
              "A goal in my courses is to make them accessible to students with a broadest range of characteristics.",
              "This may not technically include everyone, but that is what I am shooting for.",
              "\"Everyone\" includes students with disabilities, but also students with various learning preferences, students whose first language is not in the language in which the instruction is delivered (English language learners in the case of this course), students using a variety of devices and web browsers, and those with slow Internet connections.",
              "I know I will not fully achieve this goal, but as new versions of this course are created, I will get closer and closer to the mark, in part by listening to input from my students.",
              "Applying proactive design practices can reduce the need for accommodations for specific students after an online learning product or activity is created.",
              "There are many practices that employ proactive design: accessible design, inclusive design, usable design, user-centered design, ability-based design, design for user empowerment, design for all, barrier free design, and universal design (UD).",
              "Although all offer contributions to the field, UD was selected as the proactive design framework on which to elaborate in this course because it has led to the most comprehensive and established principles and practices that can guide the design of inclusive cyberlearning technology and pedagogy.",
              "The basic framework is underpinned by the seven principles of UD, the three principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), and the four principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), all described in the paragraphs that follow.",
              "UD requires that a broad spectrum of abilities and other characteristics of potential users be considered when developing products and environments, rather than simply designing for the average user and relying on accommodations alone when a product or environment is not reasonably accessible to an individual.",
              "UD is defined by the Center for Universal Design (n.",
              "d.)",
              "as \u201cthe design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.",
              "\u201d Principles for the UD of any product or environment include the following: These principles, originally applied to the design of architecture and commercial products, have also been broadly applied to the design of IT hardware and software, later to instruction, and even later to student services (Burgstahler, 2015).",
              "A universally-designed space or product, including an online learning environment, is accessible to, usable by, and inclusive of everyone, including people with disabilities.",

              "Applying the combination of UD, UDL, and WCAG principles is particularly suitable for addressing both technological and pedagogical aspects of online learning in order to ensure that students are offered multiple, accessible ways to gain knowledge, demonstrate understanding, and interact.",
              "However, rather than attempting to memorize principles that underpin the inclusive design of online learning, I simply remind myself to follow these concepts: Although the need is minimized with this approach, reasonable accommodations will in some cases still be necessary to ensure full access and engagement to a particular student when the universally designed offering does not already do so.",
              "For example, a student with a learning disability engaging in a universally-designed online course may require extra time on an examination as determined by disability support personnel.",
              "Similarly, a student who is deaf may require a realtime captioner when engaging with the class using a video communication system.",

              "To clarify for students, instructors write a list of the marked keywords after problems are solved or concepts are discussed.",
              "Lastly in a more challenging game, instructors show a formula or say a definition of a keyword.",

              "\u201d This method requires students to have a strong previous understanding of the material because there is less explicit keyword guidance from the instructor.",
              "All students enrolled in the course (38 students) were invited to participate in the game activity during the class session;",
              "35 completed the game activity during the class and responded to the post-survey questions (92% of the total class enrollment).",
              "The results indicate that students responded positively to the game and were motivated to play it.",
              "In this study, to foster authentic student motivation, participation was voluntary, and we did not offer any reward to evaluate if students have intrinsic motives for participating in the game.",
              "While the use of rewards in educational systems is controversial,15 it can increase motivation for active participation by offering an incentive in a normally apathetic virtual classroom.",
              "For instance, if students fill their entire Bingo card and all keywords are reviewed, the instructor can offer a bonus question or bonus points on an upcoming assignment.",
              "Class engagement can fall into three categories: emotional, behavioral, and cognitive.",
              "6 Our goals in playing the Bingo game were to increase engagement in the virtual classroom, within the biofluid mechanics\u2019 course.",
              "Engagement is evaluated as interest in the game activity24 and by collecting the student feedback in an anonymous survey.",
              "22 We distributed the survey after playing Bingo to determine if students felt more engaged and attentive in the class while participating in the game.",

              "Also, 72% of students felt that the game instructions were easy to follow and did not distract from course material.",
              "Moreover, behavioral engagement encompasses energetic actions such as active class participation in discussion, asking questions, and socialization among students, all of which are crucial to academic achievement.",
              "6 If students did have a question about reviewing the course material, they felt comfortable enough to unmute and ask or type their questions in the chat feature on zoom.",
              "In addition to this contribution, 68% of students said they were more likely to ask questions and participate when a game is played during remote class.",
              "Finally, measures of cognitive engagement involve demonstration of comprehension of material, such as when students successfully understand and follow instructions or correctly answer a question.",
              "6 Although we have not measured the cognitive aspect directly in our survey due to logistical and ethical concerns, 94% of students either agreed or strongly agreed that the game simulated their thinking and helped them to focus on the concept.",
              "Because of these agreeable survey results in different categories of engagement, we can conclude that gamification in remote environments increased engagement.",
              "Based on our experience, an academic game can be used to improve memory of terms and facts, review of relevant course concepts, or preparation for in-lecture discussion.",
              "This method can be incorporated when the instructor plans to break the routine of teaching and making teaching fun.",
              "It is also an opportunity for the instructor to evaluate their pedagogy and teaching strategy while they are designing the game.",
              "Gamification in the remote environment seems more complicated than an in-person environment.",
              "The main difference for both instructors and students alike is that remote learning environments lack emotional and social aspects.",
              "Students often absorb energy from the social aspect of school, and their reactions likewise respond more energetically to learning.",
              "One vital challenge we encountered was finding materials for the game that can be easily distributed virtually.",
              "Through our exploration of this issue, we realized that the materials and opportunities for games in a virtual format are not as available as those for in-person education.",
              "For example, it is very easy for an instructor to design his or her own Bingo cards in a text editing software and physically distribute them to the class.",
              "However, making the Bingo cards virtually interactive, where students can mark the cards on their devices, proved to be much more difficult.",
              "Sometimes monetary payment is required to complete this task or obtain enough Bingo cards for the entire class, which may not be feasible for some instructors.",
              "The next challenge we experienced was choosing whether to have a reward system, and if so, deciding what reward should be offered.",
              "Our goal was to motivate students to learn and be more engaged in a virtual format, but we had to avoid students only being motivated and engaged when playing the game and having the reward.",
              "We had to carefully design the mechanics of the game with an incentive to inspire students while not discouraging learning when the incentive and game are removed.",
              "This decision also ties into our desire to ensure that the course material was still credible and grasped seriously by students during gamification.",
              "Analysis of the benefits of the incentive was not completed and would be a suitable option for further investigation of remote gamification in pedagogy.",
              "The reward must be designed to promote intrinsic motivation (see Ref.",
              "15 for some ideas) and completion of mastery-oriented goals.",
              "28 This positive correlation boosts engagement and social interactions15,23 which can depreciate through purely online learning.",
              "By rewarding students for reviewing crucial material, they feel a sense of accomplishment and mastery.",
              "This increases student motivation to partake in the game and will consequently aid in their collective engagement.",
              "In the future, success of the game approach will be measured using course marks, lecturer evaluations, lecture attendance, and student\u2019s feedback.",
              "Student feedback will be obtained using reflection assignments, course surveys, and individual meetings with students.",

              "3 to cover key aspects of the remote game involving engagement and understanding of the material.",
              "We would like to mention that in this study we only asked four questions to increase the participation in the survey as students are unlikely to respond to long surveys, however, our assessment would be strengthened by incorporating established engagement scales and measures.",
              "12,14 The engagement-disengagement scale in Ref.",
              "14 includes 39 agree/disagree statements which multiple questions are considered to evaluate each aspects of student\u2019s motivation and engagement styles, such as emotional, cognitive, and behavioral.",

              "12 includes 59 statements focused on student engagement in higher education and the connection to their learning.",
              "We will take these established measurement tools into consideration to design questionnaire items in our future surveys, to ensure that gamification meets course outcomes and enhances student engagement.",
              "However, further analysis tools must be balanced against the costs, both monetary and time, required to successfully implement the game activity.",
              "The extent of student participation and effectiveness of motivators and rewards can also be gauged by direct observation and student feedback.",
              "This information helps to re-tune game components for future implementations.",
              "This paper does not propose that games can be used for everything;",

              "9 for details on controversy).",
              "For example, game can make the concepts seem less serious to students and the implementation must be carefully selected to target intrinsic motivation.",
              "Moreover, integration with the curriculum is a key challenge.",
              "It might be difficult at times for the instructor to match the game with instructional goals and a poor fit will hamper learning.",
              "30 Games tend to be time consuming and often require a great amount of time to create and implement.",
              "Academic games can also require special materials or facilities to which faculty may not have access.",
              "Finally, motivation is both a driver and challenge for the use of games and learning.",
              "While some students share an interest in games, not everybody plays games or would find a game within their course a wholesome element.",
              "Moreover, relying on games for course assessment and student performance without an understanding of course objectives can be detrimental to intrinsic motivation.",

              "The question is: how do you build a sense of community in your online courses?",
              "One approach involves cultivating more interaction\u2014between you and your students and among the students themselves.",
              "Here are five practical tips for increasing the human connection in your online classrooms. When online courses are completely asynchronous, there is often limited interaction between you and your students and class members with each other.",

              "That lag in response time kills the momentum of a back-and-forth discussion and can sometimes lead to misunderstandings.",
              "Integrating opportunities for real-time interaction into your online course can help change that and develop a sense of community in a course.",
              "Consider how impromptu conversations outside the traditional classroom forge relationships, clarify ideas, and spark new insights.",
              "You can facilitate these interactions by setting up opportunities for class members to meet online synchronously both formally and informally.",
              "Using webconferencing applications, you can create a variety of synchronous interaction opportunities, such as office hours, small group discussions, whole class discussions, and study groups.",
              "Discussion boards have long been the communication staple for online courses, but there are ways you can make this experience more interactive for much wider and deeper participation.",
              "In a traditional classroom, it\u2019s common for only a small percentage of students to participate in discussion.",
              "In an online environment, you can structure your discussions so that everyone contributes, plus they\u2019ll have more time to consider what they want to say before responding.",
              "Class size helps determine how you organize discussions.",
              "In a larger class of, say, 100 students, you can set up smaller discussion groups of 20 or so people so that students can get to know their fellow classmates.",
              "You can also create even smaller groups (5-7 people) for more intimate interaction, and rotate these groups to expand interactions.",
              "This approach also works with smaller class sizes.",
              "One technique that fosters richer dialogue is creating discussion prompts that are open ended, such as requiring students to provide examples or asking them to interpret a concept from a variety of perspectives.",
              "You could also set up student-facilitated discussion opportunities where students craft the discussion prompt and guide the ensuing dialogue.",
              "Non-task interactions are those exchanges that are not part of the direct learning, but help create a supportive learning community.",
              "You can facilitate these types of interactions by leveraging the social networking capabilities that are available in many learning management systems, such as chat and webconferencing.",

              "By gaining an understanding of these basic processes, we are able to develop teaching and learning strategies that maximize knowledge retention and transfer.",
              "After decades of research, cognitive psychologists have identified six strategies with considerable experimental evidence to support their use [9].",
              "These six strategies include spaced practice, interleaving, elaboration, concrete examples, dual coding, and retrieval practice.",
              "Below I describe each of these strategies but also caution the reader to consider how any particular strategy is utilized in a learning activity.",
              "The key to effective learning is understanding the underlying mechanism\u2014understanding how the learner is mentally engaged in the learning process.",
              "The first of the six strategies is spaced practice.",
              "Spaced practice is a strategy in which study sessions are separated in time instead of being massed into a single session [1].",
              "For example, long-term retention will be improved if a student studied for one hour every night of the week instead of seven hours the night before an exam.",
              "Interleaving often involves some amount of natural spacing, but adds an additional benefit from changing the order in which items are studied or reviewed [8].",
              "In this way, students are more likely to recognize the similarities and differences between items or materials.",
              "Elaboration, or more specifically elaborative interrogation, involves asking \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d questions about materials [7].",
              "This works particularly well when students can connect the elaborated information to their prior knowledge and therefore doesn\u2019t work as well for novices [10].",
              "A strategy that does work well with novices is the use of concrete examples, in which students are given a variety of examples using concrete information that is easier to understand and visualize than the abstract counterparts [2].",
              "Dual coding is a strategy in which verbal and visual information are combined to enhance encoding [6].",
              "That is, pictures, graphic organizers, diagrams, etc.",
              "can be effectively used in combination with verbal information.",
              "Finally, retrieval practice increases retention over and above repeated studying of information.",
              "While these six strategies have been identified as effective for learning, the manner in which they are applied does matter.",
              "As noted above, elaboration is a strategy that works more effectively with relative experts, as students need background information to elaborate on.",
              "Dual coding is useful, but if the visual and verbal information is redundant, then learning is hampered [3].",
              "Several studies have demonstrated that the manner in which you apply retrieval practice is important for learning.",
              "In one study, elementary students were given a retrieval activity that was identical (but with age-appropriate materials) to one that had been previously used with college students [4].",
              "The elementary students performed near floor on the task and needed scaffolded support in order to show a retrieval benefit.",
              "In another study, off the shelf materials were used in a manner consistent with how instructors use quizzing in the classroom [11].",
              "While the assumption with these materials was that retrieval of factual information should promote transfer, there was no increase in performance on related application questions, likely due to the degree or relatedness between items. Similarly, in an unpublished study, having students write their own retrieval practice questions and then answer a partner\u2019s question (that is, peer quizzing) actually led to reduced performance on the related unit exam [5].",
              "The questions that the students wrote were more item-specific than the instructor-written quiz questions, leading students to attend to surface-level material more in the student-written condition.",
              "In order to appropriately apply evidence-based practices, it is key for instructors to understand the underlying mechanisms that support their use.",
              "The strategies for effective learning summarized above should serve as guiding principles, such that instructors are better able to apply the science of learning to the art of teaching.",
              "Each strategy can and should be used with consideration of the materials, students, background knowledge, and current context instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach to these activities.",
              "With thoughtful application, these evidence-based learning strategies have the potential to improve benefits from individual study as well as classroom instruction.",
