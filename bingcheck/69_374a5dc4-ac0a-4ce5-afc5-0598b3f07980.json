    "response": "The Burj Khalifa is an engineering marvel that stands at a whopping **828 meters** in the air. Building such a tall structure came with its own set of engineering challenges. According to one source[^1^], some of the biggest challenges were:\n\n- **Withstanding extreme heat**: The building had to cope with temperatures reaching more than **50 degree Celsius** in summers. To do that, an exterior cladding made of reflective glazing with aluminium and textured stainless steel panels were used.\n- **Managing condensation**: The hot climate also caused around **15 million gallons** of water to condense from the structure. To deal with that, a separate piping system was created to store the water in a tank in the basement.\n- **Resisting wind loads**: The building had to face strong wind forces that could twist and sway the structure. To understand the behaviour of the wind and the amount of stress it could place on the building, the design team conducted over **40 wind tunnel tests**. The top structure of the Burj Khalifa was made to resemble the letter 'Y' and each of the three wings of the structure buttressed others through a central core.\n- **Handling concrete weight**: The combined weight of the concrete used for building the Burj Khalifa is equivalent to **100,000 elephants**. The engineers had to mix the concrete with ice and pour it at night to avoid the hot climate and prevent cracking.\n- **Lifting aluminium panels**: The total weight of all the aluminium used on the Burj Khalifa surpasses that of **five A380 aircraft**. These panels were lifted using a series of cranes and installed by specialists.\n\nThese are some of the major challenges that the engineers faced while designing and building the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world.",

              "Since the shrinkage in concrete occurs more quickly in thinner walls or columns, the perimeter column thickness of 600 mm (24 inches) matched the typical corridor wall thickness (similar volume to surface ratios) to ensure the columns and walls will generally shorten at the same rate due to concrete shrinkage.",
              "Due to the compatibility requirements of strain between the rebar and the concrete in a reinforced concrete column, as the concrete creeps and shrinks (i.",

              "imresolt.",
              "com) The project is the latest and largest manifestation of the world's increasing appetite for super-tall buildings.",
              "According to the Council on Tall Buildings and the Urban Habitat (CTBUH, 2010), there were 82 buildings of 300 m or greater under construction in January 2010, the vast majority of which were being constructed primarily with reinforced concrete.",
              "At least four buildings of around 1000 m are currently at the detailed proposal stage and others with heights of 1400\u20131600 m are on drawing boards.",
              "High-performance concrete is a crucial part of the viability of super-tall buildings, both structurally and economically.",
              "The stiffness provided by high-modulus concrete has significant benefits in terms of limiting movement, and high strength is necessary to reduce the cross-section of vertical elements.",
              "Furthermore, the pumpability and high early strength of high-performance concrete coupled with prefabrication of reinforcing cages and advances in slip- and climb-form technology mean that large, complex reinforced-concrete structures can be constructed at rates of two to three levels per week.",
              "Properly designed reinforced concrete is thus becoming far more competitive with structural steel in terms of construction speed.",
              "For the many super-tall structures and other major infrastructure projects under construction in the Middle East, the durability of high-performance concrete also helps to ensure the required service life will be achieved in a hot, chemically aggressive environment.",
              "However, such concrete can be more sensitive than conventional concrete during the plastic and early hardening phase, particularly in a harsh drying environment.",
              "This paper discusses the issues encountered with using high-performance concrete on Burj Khalifa and how they were overcome.",
              "The suitability of reinforced-concrete construction for super-tall buildings is entirely dependent on the ability to pump the concrete.",
              "The material may not be viable if large quantities need to be placed by crane, which would not only limit the casting rate but also significantly delay other works.",
              "However, whereas the literature contains a great deal of information on many characteristics of high-performance concrete, there is little information on pumping.",
              "It was originally planned to conduct staged pumping at Burj Khalifa, which would have involved a separate set of problems and possible delays.",
              "However, following mixture development, procedural modifications, pressure monitoring and the advent of powerful pumps such as the Putzmeister 14000 SHP-D, a world-record pumping height of 601 m was achieved during the final part of the core wall casting in November 2007 (Figure 2).",
              "The previous record was 448 m at Taipeh 101 Tower in 2003.",
              "Figure 2 A world record concrete pumping height of 601 m was achieved on 8 November 2007 It was also considered economic to pump relatively small quantities of C50 concrete for metal deck composite slabs above the 586 m concrete core rather than use cranes, adding a further 5 m to the record in April 2008.",
              "For a 48 m3 slab using 3 m3 skips with a 30 min transit time, the maximum casting rate would be 12 m3/h and would require two cranes full time for 4 h.",
              "For pumping, the time in the pipeline was approximately 30 min at this elevation but resulted in a relatively uninterrupted casting rate of 20 m3/h or more thereafter.",
              "The 11 m3 of concrete evacuated during cleaning the pipeline was used in other applications.",
              "One of the challenges to designing pumpable concrete in the Middle East is the use of crushed aggregate for both coarse and fine aggregate.",
              "Two principal types of aggregate are used in the region: gabbro and a high-quality limestone, principally from the Emirates and Oman, though the quality of the fine aggregate can vary significantly around the Gulf.",
              "The abrasion characteristics of coarse aggregate are an important consideration for pumping: the rate of wear of the pipeline is a significant cost consideration, particularly at high pressure.",
              "The lifespan of a pipeline when using highly abrasive gabbro can be as low as 10 000 m3.",
              "For Burj Khalifa, approximately 40 000 m3 of a suitably designed mix containing a dolomitic limestone was pumped through the central pipeline with only minor local replacement.",
              "Another crucial consideration in mixture proportioning is the pipeline diameter and the maximum aggregate size.",
              "A 150 mm pipeline was used on Burj Khalifa, which enabled a 20 mm maximum aggregate size to be used up to level 100 (346 m).",
              "There are issues with weight, cost and concrete volume associated with the use of larger diameter pipes for high-pressure pumping.",
              "As such, use of a smaller diameter pipeline with a smaller maximum aggregate size may be more practical in many applications.",
              "a problem with pumping concrete on a super-tall tower is that the degree of difficulty is always increasing but the team can become blase\u0301 There is a tendency today to use a high proportion of fine aggregate in high-performance concrete, particularly when it is designed to have a slump flow exceeding 500 mm.",
              "However, even with higher fines, these concretes were found to have low shrinkage and creep characteristics.",
              "In the Emirates, a fine dune sand (<600 \u03bcm) is also used to increase the finer fraction and the improve cohesion of the mixture, while in other areas such as Qatar \u2013 where dune sand contains high quantities of gypsum \u2013 viscosity-modifying admixtures can be used to improve cohesion and segregation resistance.",
              "In the case of Burj Khalifa, the fine-aggregate percentage for tower mixes was approximately 50% and fly ash was used at a replacement level of 13\u201320% together with silica fume at 5\u201310%.",
              "A specially modified superplasticiser was developed for the project by BASF to achieve greater workability retention with early strength development.",
              "Indicative mixture proportions are given by Aldred (2007).",
              "Concrete pumping trials were conducted before the Burj Khalifa tower construction using a Putzmeister BSA 14000 HP-D stationary pump with a maximum hydraulic pressure of 310 bar.",
              "A length of 600 m of high-pressure ZX 125 delivery pipe was laid out horizontally with transducers to measure concrete pressure after pumping through distances of 250, 450 and 600 m (Figure 3).",
              "The pipeline was in direct sunlight, but during one of the cooler months of the year.",
              "Figure 3 A 600 m, 125 mm diameter concrete delivery pipe fitted with transducers was laid out on the ground near the site to help assess pressures due to pipe friction Five different concrete mixtures were tested, and fresh and hardened concrete properties were measured before and after pumping.",
              "This procedure provided useful data, indicating that single-stage pumping would be possible as well as highlighting certain practical problems which reduced possible blockage during construction.",
              "However, there were changes in a number of parameters that meant friction factors calculated for the pumping trial were different from in situ pumping.",
              "An alternative procedure to horizontal trials is the use of in situ pressure transducers at the hopper, at the end of the horizontal section of the pipeline and at various elevations to establish the friction factor in situ.",
              "The limitation of this procedure is that blockage of the pipeline cannot be allowed, which tends to inhibit pushing the limits.",
              "Appropriate positioning of pumps and planning of concrete-truck flow on and off site will help ensure smooth operation of pumping.",
              "Equipment and tools necessary to clear the pipeline in the event of blockage should be kept in a locked area near the point of discharge to enable immediate action by the pumping team if required.",
              "A seminar with the concrete supplier, pump operators, contractor's supervisors and consultant's representatives should be conducted, with an interpreter if necessary, so that all parties know the procedure and their role.",
              "This should be repeated regularly: a problem with pumping concrete on a super-tall tower is that the degree of difficulty is always increasing but the team can become blase\u0301.",
              "Concrete in the Middle East has a potential for blockage during pumping due temperature effects and delays.",
              "If practically possible, all pumping of concrete, particularly in summer months, should be conducted at night.",
              "The batching plant should be as close as possible to the project to reduce transit time and disruptions to supply \u2013 a site plant is best.",
              "Careful consideration should be given to the maximum allowed concrete placement temperature.",
              "To achieve the common limit of 32\u00b0C with high-performance concrete, and depending on the moisture content of the fine aggregate, the added water content could be almost completely composed of flake ice during the summer months, when shade temperatures can exceed 50\u00b0C.",
              "Limited variation in rheology and concrete temperature through summer will help minimise pumping problems. Batching plants in the Middle East generally use pan mixers or similar where the ingredients are well mixed before discharge into a truck.",
              "At large replacement levels, most of the flake ice needs to melt to lubricate the mix before discharge.",
              "Monitoring the ammeter in the plant provides a good indication of the workability of the concrete in the pan, and workability should be measured at the plant and site regularly to confirm full melting before pumping.",
              "If there is no ice facility at the batching plant, an alternative is to use a high-volume fly ash mixture to limit the heat of hydration.",
              "This was done for the 4 m thick raft of the 412 m Al Hamra Tower in Kuwait, where the casting was scheduled in August and a peak temperature of 71\u00b0C was specified, and the batching plant did not have an ice plant.",
              "At various elevations on the Burj Khalifa project, concrete was tested for rheological properties, using an Icar rheometer, and temperature both before and after pumping.",
              "The sampling included C80-20, C80-14 and C60-14 concretes.",
              "There was some variation in the results but the average effects of pumping to elevations from 350 m to 580 m was a 2\u20133\u00b0C rise in temperature and a 10% reduction in slump flow.",
              "Pumping was found roughly to halve the plastic viscosity of the concrete and double the dynamic yield stress.",
              "The results appear related to the increase in temperature during pumping.",
              "The significantly lower plastic viscosity after pumping will reduce the segregation resistance of the concrete, and should be considered during mix design and when deciding on placement procedures.",
              "On the other hand, pumping will tend significantly to increase early-age compressive strength.",
              "The greater strength after pumping combined with the significant concrete volume within typical structural elements means that the in situ compressive strength can greatly exceed that of compliance cube/cylinder specimens, particularly if taken before pumping.",
              "Where demanding early-age strength targets are required, the in situ maturity should be assessed using appropriate methods to avoid possible unnecessary modification to the mixture, such as reduced retardation, that may compromise pumpability.",
              "While sampling at the point of discharge would be more representative of the concrete in the actual structure, it can create significant logistical and safety problems, especially on a confined climb form.",
              "On Burj Khalifa, samples were taken at a site laboratory with periodic assessment of the effect of pumping by sampling concrete after it was pumped.",
              "At Burj Khalifa there were three stationary concrete pumps positioned in parallel on the ground floor slab adjacent to the tower: two Putzmeister BSA 14000 SHP-Ds with maximum hydraulic pressure of 360 bar (equivalent to a concrete pressure up to 240 bar) and one Putzmeister BSA 14000 HP-D with a maximum hydraulic pressure of 310 bar (Figure 4).",
              "The pumps were connected to 150 mm diameter high-pressure pipes servicing the three wings and the central core, all with separate delivery pipelines.",
              "This configuration meant that concrete could be placed at up to three separate locations simultaneously.",
              "Figure 4 A total of 165 000 m3 of concrete for the Burj Khalifa tower was delivered by three Putzmeister pumps on the ground floor with up to 240 bar capacity Free-standing Putzmeister placing booms with a reach of 28 m were located on each of the three wings while a larger placing boom with a reach of 32 m was used for the central core (Figure 5).",
              "The booms were secured to the Doka climb-form system and were raised along with the formwork.",
              "The delivery pipelines were connected to reducers several floors below the formwork to connect to the 125 mm diameter booms. Figure 5 MX32 Putzmeister concrete placing boom on the core, seen here with its operator, had a 32 m reach and was mounted on a 20 m high steel column attached to the Doka climbing formwork The general trend of increasing pumping pressure with elevation and the effect of different concrete types are shown in Figure 6.",
              "At floor 101, the concrete for the core walls changed from C80-20 to C80-14, with a noticeable reduction in pumping pressure.",
              "The increased water/cement ratio of the C60-14 mixture appeared to reduce pumping pressure slightly compared to C80-14.",
              "Figure 6 Graph showing how pumping pressure increased with height up to around 200 bar \u2013 and the reduction due to changing from 20 mm to 14 mm aggregate above 346 m All the potential benefits of pumping high-performance concrete can be lost if blockage occurs and therefore preventing blockage must be a vital consideration.",
              "Blockage can be caused by priming with a wet slurry, excessive delay, inadequate retardation and incompatibility of admixtures.",
              "Measurement of fresh concrete properties at the site can be a useful guide to the suitability of the delivered concrete before pumping.",
              "Temperature, slump flow and visual inspection for segregation after slump flow should be tested both at the plant and on site.",
              "Good practice is to measure the first three trucks and then regularly thereafter.",
              "On Burj Khalifa, detailed rheological properties of the core concrete were assessed at every fifth level.",
              "With the extreme ambient temperatures that can occur in the Middle East, blockage due to setting is a particular concern.",
              "On a super-tall structure, the substantial volume within the pipeline and the time for the concrete to reach the point of discharge need to be fully understood before attempting to push \u2018old\u2019 concrete through.",
              "The old adage of \u2018better safe than sorry' is especially true of evacuating a pipeline in which a problem has occurred or when the concrete in the pipeline has exceeded an agreed time since batching.",
              "There have been significant advances in many aspects of concrete technology in the Middle East, with great increases in strength, modulus and durability.",
              "However, a serious limitation in the region has been the lack of systematic quality control.",
              "This has often been exacerbated by high test errors of cube samples as well as sometimes unreliable reporting of compliance data.",
              "Production standard deviations of greater than 7 MPa have been common as are within-test standard deviations of e MPa or more based on 28-day pair differences.",
              "Significant sources of error are the quality of the cube moulds, sampling, curing and testing.",
              "Samples for compressive strength or other hardened properties should be taken at a properly controlled testing facility.",
              "Attempting to take samples at the point of discharge often results in poor to non-existent initial curing and early mechanical damage during transport.",
              "Compliance data are often used for quality assurance but not in a timely manner to influence production, which has led to over-design of concrete mixtures.",
              "Aside from reduced economy, the variability in compressive strength indicates an underlying variability in mixture proportions, which may also influence rheology and pumpability.",
              "Due to the high production and testing variability, it is prudent to include an in situ testing programme to confirm design assumptions.",
              "High-performance concrete in the Middle East is often designed with high workability and would be considered self-consolidating concrete in many parts of the world.",
              "However, it is often placed and vibrated using the same techniques as traditional concrete, which can lead to segregation.",
              "High-workability, high-performance concrete should be allowed to flow from the point of discharge and stop moving before any limited vibration (Figure 7).",
              "In the case of vertical elements, small portable tremie pipes can be placed at the approximate flow distance apart to reduce the time to position the placing boom or pump outlet.",
              "Such modifications to construction practices can be very helpful in super-tall structures, enabling contractors to keep the concrete pumping at a constant rate and thereby avoid blockages due to excessive articulation of placing booms containing static concrete, particularly when the weather is hot.",
              "Any blockage in a placing boom is difficult to clear and the piping is expensive to replace.",
              "Figure 7 Placing high-workability concrete in the core walls at night \u2013 minimal movements of the boom between placing points helped to avoid blockages The installation of a reducer near the pump can be a good precaution so that any concrete with a high segregation potential blocks at that location rather than elsewhere in the pipeline.",
              "This will not necessarily prevent blockage caused by a wet slurry, or stop viscosity reduction during pumping, but it is a good precaution against variability in the delivered concrete.",
              "High-performance concrete in the Middle East typically contains 5\u201310% silica fume with a high cementitious content and has a tendency rapidly to form a \u2018skin\u2019 under the harsh drying conditions.",
              "The skin can limit the melding of cast layers, but can be reduced by retaining moisture in the concrete surface by the use of evaporation retarders and other methods to reduce evaporation.",
              "The thixotropic nature of self-consolidating concrete can also induce distinct layer casting of the material.",
              "The first consequence of this is often only visual but reductions in mechanical strength of more than 40% have also been reported by Coussot and Roussel (2006).",
              "A dramatic reduction in strength following a critical delay between casting a subsequent layer is also shown by Roussel and Cussigh (2008).",
              "This can be a particular concern in casting self-consolidating-concrete rafts or other elements where the delay between layers can be substantial and no vibration is conducted.",
              "High-performance concrete usually has negligible bleed and can be quite cohesive.",
              "Therefore finishing works require operatives to develop a feel for material.",
              "Trial applications should be conducted early to enable the finishers to become familiar with the concrete's properties and to confirm an acceptable finish.",
              "Evaporation retarders facilitate finishing by retaining moisture in the upper layer helping to eliminate sprinkling of water on the concrete during finishing, which reduces surface quality.",
              "The low bleed characteristics of high-performance concrete and the strong drying conditions in the Middle East make the concrete particularly susceptible to plastic shrinkage cracking.",
              "In the warmer months, high-performance concrete will often have a placement temperature less than ambient and moisture will tend to condense on the fresh concrete surface.",
              "However, after the surface has heated to ambient temperature, the formation of plastic cracks can be rapid and dramatic if appropriate measures are not taken to limit evaporation.",
              "An evaporation retarder is a very practical and inexpensive method to reduce plastic shrinkage cracking.",
              "Wind breaks and sun shades are also helpful.",
              "Effective fogging is the best method as it can actually keep a high humidity layer at the concrete surface, though wind breaks may be necessary to confine the body of air above the concrete.",
              "For flatwork, concreting and finishing in the heat of the day should be avoided with pours planned so that curing can commence before 10 a.",

              "at the latest.",
              "The general guideline as given in ACI 305-99 (ACI committee 305, 1999) is that the rate of evaporative loss which exceeds the rate of bleeding (i.",
              "e. when plastic cracking would occur) is approximately 1\u00b70 (kg/m2)/h (NRMCA, 1960).",
              "However, some agencies in the USA require that pouring of high-performance concrete bridge deck overlays be postponed until the rate of evaporation is less than 0\u00b725 or 0\u00b750 (kg/m2)/h (VDT, 2002;",
              "Hover, 2006).",
              "If plastic cracks do develop, the cracks concerned should be vibrated if the concrete has not reached initial set.",
              "Attempts to close plastic cracks by trowelling will generally only cover over the cracks, which may influence structural performance and provide pathways for chlorides to the reinforcement.",
              "The optimum curing for high-performance concrete is ponding with water.",
              "This provides water to replace that used in hydration, improving concrete properties and helping to reduce early autogenous shrinkage.",
              "The latent heat of evaporation helps release the heat of concrete hydration, which can markedly reduce peak temperature \u2013 especially in concrete containing fly ash, slag and natural pozzolans.",
              "The use of polythene over wet hessian will help keep water in contact with the concrete surface but does not allow evaporative heat loss from the surface.",
              "Ponding is best for thicker elements.",
              "Early-age autogenous shrinkage can be particularly significant in high-performance concrete containing high replacement levels of slag (Aldred and Lim, 2004).",
              "Even limited periods of water curing immediately after finishing can thus provide significant reductions in autogenous shrinkage.",
              "However, the immediate application of a curing membrane may increase early autogenous shrinkage by blocking the pores, which causes greater tensile stresses within the concrete.",
              "In applications where prolonged water curing is difficult, liquid water curing for the first day or so before application of a curing membrane would still have considerable benefits.",
              "For vertical surfaces, the use of a controlled-permeability form liner is a good technique for improving the density and appearance of the concrete surface.",
              "The water that collects in the liner is also sucked into the hydrating concrete, providing excellent early curing for vertical surfaces \u2013 traditionally the most difficult to cure effectively.",
              "Alternatively, the formwork should be kept in place for as long as possible.",
              "On Burj Khalifa, where the formwork could be set back within 12 h, a sprayed curing compound was used.",
              "Due to widespread use of crushed limestone aggregate with a low coefficient of thermal expansion and the relatively warm climate, the use of insulation on formwork is rarely required in the Middle East to control internal thermal restraint cracking.",
              "High-performance concrete offers immense benefits to developers, consultants and contractors working on the hundreds of super-tall structures under construction and planned in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world.",
              "The material's high strength and modulus mean that super-tall buildings can have more slender vertical elements.",
              "Also, as has been proved on the Burj Khalifa project in Dubai, single-stage pumping to over 600 m is now possible and this, together with high early strengths, allows rapid cycle times to meet today's demanding construction schedules.",
              "However, appropriate care and attention to mix design, placing, protection and curing is vital to minimise potential problems with pump blockage, segregation, autogenous shrinkage and cracking.",
              "Burj Khalifa shattered all previous world construction records by a considerable margin and required an enormous effort by all parties involved to overcome its many construction challenges \u2013 not least with regard to using high-performance concrete (Figure 8).",

              "Summary: Pouring 154 floors over the 829m height whilst remaining on schedule required formwork solutions that were durable and efficient.",
              "Challenge: The height of the tower meant that the construction materials needed to be handled as little as possible, as this would require costly, time-wasting logistics and take up valuable crane time.",
              "In addition, the contractor wanted to avoid an excessive, expensive inventory whilst still constructing at pace.",
              "This saved the contractor time and money, as well as reduced the logistical challenges of disposing of old formwork and shuttling new formwork to the current work area.",
              "In fact, all 154 floors of the tower were poured without a single panel being re-faced.",
              "By calculating the slab pour cycles \u2013 which needed to take into account the high temperatures and consequent effect on pouring and curing times \u2013 an optimum area of 3000m2 of slab formwork was determined.",
              "With this seemingly low number of panels, 227,808m2 of slabs (532 slabs on 154 floors) were able to be cast without any delays to the schedule.",
              "Another advantage of the MevaDec system was the ability to swiftly cast the slabs and then strip them early, so the panels could be re-used elsewhere.",
              "The slabs were poured at 6pm and then stripped at noon the following day.",
              "This rapid pace was achieved thanks to the unique MevaDec drop head, which has a quick-lowering system.",
              "This way, the panels could be removed while the props remain to support the slabs.",
              "With this approach, the slabs were ready to have the props removed in just 3 days.",
              "The low panel weight also helped, as the panels could be transferred to the next floor level with a lifting gear, rather than by being craned in.",
