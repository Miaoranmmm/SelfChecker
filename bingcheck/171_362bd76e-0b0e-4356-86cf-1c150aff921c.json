    "query": "What is the most effective way to motivate individuals to make sustainable lifestyle changes, and what role do societal factors play in incentivizing environmentally-friendly behaviors?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting and important question. There is no definitive answer, but I can share some insights from various sources that might help you explore this topic further.\n\nOne way to motivate individuals to make sustainable lifestyle changes is to help them find their **why**[^6^]. This means helping them discover what their deepest goal is, and how it aligns with their values and beliefs. For example, someone might want to reduce their meat consumption because they care about animal welfare, or because they want to lower their risk of chronic diseases, or because they want to save money. Finding the why can help them stay motivated and positive during the process.\n\nAnother way to motivate individuals is to make the change **easy**[^6^] [^1^]. This means removing barriers and obstacles that might prevent them from adopting new behaviors, and providing them with tools and support that make the change more convenient and enjoyable. For example, someone might want to drink more tap water instead of bottled water, but they might not have access to clean and safe water at home or at work. Providing them with a water filter or a reusable bottle can make it easier for them to switch. Similarly, someone might want to eat more sustainably, but they might not know how to cook or where to buy organic food. Providing them with recipes, tips, or vouchers can make it easier for them to try new foods.\n\nA third way to motivate individuals is to make the change **social**[^1^] [^5^]. This means creating a sense of community and belonging among people who share the same goals and values, and encouraging them to support each other and hold each other accountable. For example, someone might want to use public transportation more often instead of driving, but they might feel lonely or bored on the bus or train. Joining a carpool or a bike club can make it more fun and rewarding for them to travel sustainably. Similarly, someone might want to reduce their waste, but they might feel overwhelmed or discouraged by the amount of trash they produce. Joining a zero-waste group or a composting program can make it more inspiring and empowering for them to take action.\n\nOf course, individual motivation is not enough to make sustainable lifestyle changes. Societal factors also play a crucial role in incentivizing environmentally-friendly behaviors. Some of these factors include:\n\n- **Policies and regulations** that create incentives or disincentives for certain behaviors, such as taxes, subsidies, bans, quotas, standards, etc. For example, a carbon tax can discourage the use of fossil fuels and encourage the use of renewable energy sources.\n- **Education and awareness** that inform and inspire people about the benefits and impacts of their choices, such as campaigns, documentaries, labels, certifications, etc. For example, the MSC blue fish label can help consumers identify ocean-friendly seafood products that come from certified sustainable fisheries or responsible farms[^2^].\n- **Innovation and technology** that provide alternative solutions that are more efficient and effective than the status quo, such as products, services, systems, platforms, etc. For example, nuclear fusion reactors can provide clean and abundant energy that is hotter than the sun[^3^].\n\nI hope this helps you understand some of the ways to motivate individuals to make sustainable lifestyle changes, and some of the societal factors that influence them.

              "Currently, scientists are working on reactors that control the plasma through magnets, but so far fusion reactors have not produced more energy than they take to run in the first place.",
              "On top of this, there is another problem: runaway electrons produced in the reaction.",
              "These are electrons with extremely high energy that suddenly accelerate, potentially damaging the reactor wall in the process.",
              "Researchers at the Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, have now found a way to solve this issue.",
              "In a study published in the journal Physical Review Letters, they have outlined a model to slow down the electrons, meaning they become harmless to the reactor.",

              "More and more collisions means the electrons' speed is slowed down to the point where it is controllable, meaning the production of fusion energy can continue.",
              "\"When we can effectively decelerate runaway electrons, we are one step closer to a functional fusion reactor,\" Hesslow said in a statement.",
              "\"Considering there are so few options for solving the world's growing energy needs in a sustainable way, fusion energy is incredibly exciting since it takes its fuel from ordinary seawater.\"",

              "\"The control of runaways is one of a range of challenges, including materials development for the wall and exhaust regions, which must be tackled in the development of fusion energy,\" she says in an email interview.",
              "Scientists have been working on achieving fusion for over 50 years, and physicists often say the technology required is, and always will be, 30 years away.",
              "But Hesslow says this is no reason to stop trying: \"Fusion is a clean, safe and sustainable energy source, requiring very little fuel which is available from accessible reserves\u2014a main component can be obtained from ordinary seawater.",

              "Hesslow says she and the team now plan to use all the models they have built up over many years to finally solve the runaway electron problem.",

              "However, the effectiveness of monetary policies is questionable.",
              "Firstly, they are costly to implement [4].",
              "For example, the Pigovian tax or cap-and-trade emission requires relatively high administrative and monitoring costs to be successfully implemented.",
              "Secondly, the effect of monetary policies is not always sustainable in the long run [5, 6].",

              "Thus, the crowding-out effect of an environmental policy is also essential and needs to be taken into account [9, 10].",
              "Thirdly, people\u2019s motives can also be good drivers of pro-environmental behaviors [11].",

              "g., household energy consumption report) could change and develop more environmentally-oriented behaviors because of the self-evaluation/-enhancement process [45, 67].",
              "Therefore, external social influence is a factor that could positively impact pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "However, in some cases, external social influence could discourage environmental conservation.",
              "For instance, one study revealed that comparison feedback might perform poorly in encouraging environmental conservation (e.",
              "g., soil conservation) because terracing is a demanding soil conservation practice and farmers have a low perception of environmental issues [68].",
              "Thus, if there is a relatively low individual perception of an environmental issue, external social influence may also fail to promote pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "In another example, when asking people how much they are willing to contribute to environmental conservation, individuals will report lower conservation efforts if they know that their profiles and results are invisible to others.",
              "People may act collectively but regardless of the demand of the social situation if they know that others cannot observe their actions [69, 70].",
              "For example, if a community could not observe forest owners\u2019 behaviors and if there were no regulator to monitor them, then forest owners would collectively choose deforestation, even with strong social expectations (social norms) that forest conservation is essential for society [71, 72].",
              "Regarding the forest plot in Fig 3, most of the studies in the literature suggest a positive effect of internal social influence on pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "In addition to the forest plot, our meta-regression results in Table 3 suggest that internal social influence has a positive and significant effect on pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "The standardized coefficients reported in Table 3 (column 5) indicate that the internal social influences that motivate people to change their perceptions and attitudes are significant to promote pro-environmental behaviors (the standardized coefficient is 0.",

              "4680).",
              "Thus, internal social motives that help guide people to change their perceptions and attitudes toward a sustainable behavior could be more efficient than the external social influence [16, 17, 20].",
              "For instance, one study has suggested that altering individuals\u2019 perceptions by providing different visual attention to climate information (e.",
              "g., global temperature change) could reinforce their beliefs and motivations to take actions to mitigate climate change [73, 74].",
              "Our results suggest that the effect of network connection is relatively strong, with the standardized coefficient equals 0.",
              "344 (see the results in Table 3).",
              "In one study, the authors showed that network has an indirect impact on ecological health because it helps to share information and knowledge across individuals and to promote cooperation among members of the network [75].",
              "On the other hand, individuals are less likely to take a conservation action because they fear that their neighbors may free-ride on their efforts, such as restoring soil functions or investing in fertility improvements [76, 77].",
              "Thus, a stronger network connection (i.",
              "e., a denser network), the main characteristic of network structure, is an effective social incentive to enhance environmental behavioral changes.",
              "Several studies have indicated that larger network size is responsible for weaker network connection or less social interaction because individuals in a society or group only make contact or frequently interact with others living close to them [78\u201380].",
              "Our forest plot (Fig 5) suggests that network size does not affect pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "Meta-regression results also support this finding by indicating that other groups of social incentives positively affect pro-environmental behaviors compared to network size (as the base category).",
              "It should be noted that the effect of network size corresponds to the regression intercept.",
              "The latter also corresponds to the overall effect size in the meta-regression.",
              "Moreover, it represents the effect of the base category for other groups of dummies (more precisely, census data among types of data collection methods and Europe among geographical regions).",
              "Consequently, we cannot separately identify the overall effect size, the effect of network size, and the effect of the base category for other dummy groups.",
              "A simple meta-regression without variables of interest (i.",
              "e., social incentives) and any control variable gives a very rough estimation of the overall effect size (see S6 Table, also corresponding to a test for publication bias).",
              "When this meta-regression model is augmented by social incentive dummies (see Table 3, columns 1\u2019 and 3\u2019 using effect size coefficient and partial correlation coefficient as dependent variables, respectively), the intercept may become (significantly or not) negative.",
              "This is because the intercept also includes the effect of the base category of social incentives (i.",

              "Hence, increasing network size will not result in a better environmental outcome, ceteris paribus.",
              "By comparing this result with the network connection, we would expect that if an increase in the network size is accompanied by an increased degree of connection between individuals, the adverse effect of network size can be more than offset by the positive effect of connections between individuals, leading to a pro-environmental action.",
              "In other words, when requiring this combination of network size and network connection, the point of vigilance must be to observe the necessary condition of an increase in the connection.",
              "In order to have a sustainable network, the presence of a good leader appears to be necessary.",
              "This leader is responsible for providing information and keeping people connected.",
              "For example, some studies showed that a \u201cblock leadership\u201d approach treatment has a positive impact on the recycling rate of households because a leader plays a vital role in sustaining a connection and providing needed information to households within the leader\u2019s network [81, 82].",
              "Block leaders are defined as volunteers who help inform people in their groups about a specific issue.",
              "However, the coefficient of leadership in our meta-analysis regression is statistically insignificant compared to the network size (see Table 3).",
              "This result is not surprising because, among the positively significant results of leadership, some studies reported the positively small and even negative impact of leadership on pro-environmental behaviors (see the forest plot in Fig 5).",
              "For example, one study indicated that the presence of a leader in groups that have the autonomy to craft governance rules for their environmental resource could encourage the group\u2019s collective actions toward resource conservation but discourage resource conservation when groups are subject to rules imposed by others [26].",
              "A detailed analysis of the autonomy to craft governance rules would be interesting but is beyond the scope of this paper.",
              "Thus, it would be interesting for future studies to take it into account when studying the impact of leadership on pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "We also re-estimated the model by excluding one paper that reported a negative impact of leadership and obtained the same results.",
              "We can be confident that an outlier is not present in our data.",
              "Our meta-analysis results (Table 3) show that trust in institutions is a driver of pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "A lack of trust in government can lead to a negative individual perception of an institutional design/government program and prevent the individual from participating in it.",
              "For example, a well-designed agri-environmental contract cannot completely replace a farmer\u2019s trust in government institutions [83].",
              "The existing literature has also suggested that the rate of participation in an environmental program can be increased by motivating people and by maintaining and developing institutional trustworthiness [84, 85].",
              "Regarding the forest plot in Fig 6, trust in others has an overall positive effect on pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "Similar to trust in institutions, maintaining trustworthiness between individuals has a positive impact on behavioral changes, as shown by numerous studies [86].",
              "However, our meta-regression results cannot confirm the significant impact of trust in others on pro-environmental behaviors (see Table 3).",
              "Some of the existing literature suggests that trust in others may fail to motivate new attitudes about environmental issues and pollution [87].",
              "In their study, the authors argued that a higher level of trust within a close network could cultivate a sense of comfort and security and thus makes people less likely to respond to less immediate and indirectly observable environmental issues.",
              "One study indicated that trust in others performing resource conservation behaviors might have a low impact on resource extraction because of the subtractability property of the common resource (i.",
              "e., consuming an additional common resource would decrease the available resources for others) [88].",
              "As a result, because of the resource constraint, individuals who trust in others performing resource conservation feel that they have no choice but to harvest whatever the environment provides.",
              "Regarding the robustness of our estimation results, we classified pro-environmental behaviors into three different groups, including environmental conservation, environmental consumption and general pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "The detailed classification of the dependent variable is reported in S8 Table.",
              "Indeed, conservation efforts are more likely to have positive spillovers on others (i.",
              "e., positive externalities) and also more likely to be observed by others (i.",
              "e., visibility or observability) than consumption efforts (e.",
              "g., eating green).",
              "We observe that the social incentive factors play a crucial role in promoting environmental conservation rather than environmental consumption and general pro-environmental behaviors (the estimation results are reported in S9 Table).",
              "Alternatively, we checked the robustness by classifying the observed pro-environmental behaviors into two different groups, including high dependency (i.",
              "e., pro-environmental behaviors that highly depend on the critical contribution of others to ensure their successes) and low dependency, which is otherwise the pro-environmental behaviors that less likely depend on the critical contribution of others to ensure their success.",
              "The detailed definitions of these two classifications are reported in S8 Table.",
              "Indeed, similar to public good contributions, some kinds of pro-environmental behaviors like recycling or workplace pro-environmental behaviors require the contributions of many other fellow citizens to ensure their success.",
              "For instance, individuals are more likely to contribute to a public good if they observe that others also contribute [46, 89].",
              "Estimation results reported in S9 Table suggests that social incentive factors play a significant role only when pro-environmental behaviors highly depend on the contribution of others.",
              "Our results suggest that policymakers should focus on at least three issues to promote pro-environmental behaviors in society.",
              "Firstly, we found that internal social influence is the most important social incentive that positively affects pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "This result means that internal social influence that motivates people to change their perceptions and attitudes is extremely important and necessary to promote pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "In addition to internal social influence, our results suggest that external social influence also positively impacts pro-environmental behaviors but is less effective than internal influences.",
              "This result aligns with the existing literature that holds that internal social motives are better than external ones because they guide people into changing their behaviors.",
              "In contrast, external influences can drive people to perform a specific action through compliance and identification, but it is not enough to motivate them to change their perceptions and attitudes toward a sustainable behavior [16, 17, 20].",
              "This finding implies that the impacts of an environmental policy can be under-estimated if policymakers do not include social influence in their decisions regarding environmental issues.",
              "Therefore, based on our meta-analysis results, effective environmental policies should focus on strengthening individuals\u2019 personal norms by fostering environmental awareness and the sense of obligation toward eco-friendly behaviors (e.",
              "g., improving green education and providing environmental information).",
              "Secondly, since network is a valuable source of knowledge and information for individuals, the effectiveness of a conservation policy can be improved only if connections or interactions among individuals are increased.",
              "This result does not support an existing conjecture [90], which hypothesizes that increasing interactions between individuals in a large structure can be harmful to collective conservation behaviors.",
              "One example validating our results relates to pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in a spatial coordination game [91], consisting of giving agglomeration bonuses to people who interact in an enlarged network.",
              "It was shown that these bonuses could enhance coordination towards environmental conservation programs. In addition to the agglomeration bonus that encourages people to collaborate in a network to achieve an environmental target (i.",
              "e., collective actions), policymakers could also try to establish conditions under which individuals could share their knowledge to better drive them toward more sustainable behaviors (e.",
              "g., a favorable regulatory framework for environmental associations/groups).",
              "Finally, we found that trust in institutions (e.",
              "g., governments, institutions or leaders) is needed to ensure a positive impact on pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "It is important because citizens\u2019 trust in government can dictate individual behaviors to shape policy design and generate desired policy outcomes.",
              "For instance, trust in institutions could reduce the risk of free-riding and opportunistic behaviors as citizens would be willing to sacrifice some immediate personal benefits (e.",
              "g., by contributing to common goods) if they have positive expectations of the long-term outcomes of the government\u2019s policies [92].",

              "Therefore, external social influence is a factor that could positively impact pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "However, in some cases, external social influence could discourage environmental conservation.",
              "For instance, one study revealed that comparison feedback might perform poorly in encouraging environmental conservation (e.",

              "Block leaders are defined as volunteers who help inform people in their groups about a specific issue.",
              "However, the coefficient of leadership in our meta-analysis regression is statistically insignificant compared to the network size (see Table 3).",
              "This result is not surprising because, among the positively significant results of leadership, some studies reported the positively small and even negative impact of leadership on pro-environmental behaviors (see the forest plot in Fig 5).",
              "For example, one study indicated that the presence of a leader in groups that have the autonomy to craft governance rules for their environmental resource could encourage the group\u2019s collective actions toward resource conservation but discourage resource conservation when groups are subject to rules imposed by others [26].",

              "In their study, the authors argued that a higher level of trust within a close network could cultivate a sense of comfort and security and thus makes people less likely to respond to less immediate and indirectly observable environmental issues.",

              "In contrast, external influences can drive people to perform a specific action through compliance and identification, but it is not enough to motivate them to change their perceptions and attitudes toward a sustainable behavior [16, 17, 20].",
              "This finding implies that the impacts of an environmental policy can be under-estimated if policymakers do not include social influence in their decisions regarding environmental issues.",

              "Incentives are extensively discussed in several EPA reports: Two basic types of traditional regulatory approaches exist.",
              "The first, a technology or design standard, mandates specific control technologies or production processes that polluters must use to meet an emissions standard.",
              "The second, a performance-based standard, also requires that polluters meet an emissions standard, but allows the polluters to choose any available method to meet that standard.",
              "Performance-based standards that are technology-based, for example, do not specify a particular technology, but rather consider what available and affordable technologies can achieve when establishing a limit on emissions.",
              "At times, EPA may completely ban or phase out the use or production of a particular product or pollutant, as it has done with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and certain pesticides.",
              "Regulations can be uniform or can vary according to size of the polluting entity, production processes, or similar factors.",
              "Regulations are often tailored in this manner so that similar regulated entities are treated equally.",
              "While traditional regulatory and voluntary approaches are valuable policy tools for some types of environmental problems, incentive based policies are becoming increasingly popular as tools for addressing a wide range of environmental issues, from acid rain to climate change.",
              "Market-based approaches or incentives provide continuous inducements, monetary and near-monetary, to encourage polluting entities to reduce releases of harmful pollutants.",
              "As a result, market-based approaches create an incentive for the private sector to incorporate pollution abatement into production or consumption decisions and to innovate in such a way as to continually search for the least costly method of abatement.",
              "A criticism of command-and-control policies is that firms are only encouraged to reduce to a regulated level.",
              "With market incentives, firms will reduce their emissions as long as it is financially valuable for them to do so, and this generally happens at a point where marginal abatement costs are equated across all regulated firms. Cost savings to firms also often translate into cost savings to customers who purchase products from regulated firms, resulting in lower overall social costs.",
              "The main disadvantage associated with economic incentives is that they can be inappropriate for dealing with environmental issues that pose equity concerns.",
              "Emissions trading programs, for example, could have the unintended consequence of concentrating pollution in economically-disadvantaged areas (pollution hot-spots).",
              "Example market-based approaches include: In addition to the instruments listed above, hybrid approaches \u2013 those that combine aspects of command-and-control and market-based incentive policies \u2013 are often discussed in the literature and increasingly used in practice.",
              "These approaches are appealing to policymakers because they often combine the certainty associated with a given emissions standard with the flexibility of allowing firms to pursue the least costly abatement method.",
              "However, hybrid approaches are not always the most economically efficient approach because either the level of abatement or the cost of the policy is greater than what would be achieved through the use of a market-based incentive approach.",
              "Examples of hybrid approaches include: EPA has also pursued a number of non-regulatory approaches that rely on voluntary initiatives to achieve improvements in emissions controls and management of environmental hazards.",
              "These programs are usually not intended as substitutes for formal regulation but instead act as important complements to existing regulation.",
              "Many of EPA\u2019s voluntary programs encourage polluting entities to go beyond what is mandated by existing regulation.",
              "Others have been developed to improve environmental quality in areas that policymakers expect may be regulated in the future but are currently not regulated, such as greenhouse gas emissions and non-point source water pollution.",
              "There are two types of trading programs currently used in the United States: Emission Reduction Credits (ERCs) and Capped allowance systems (i.",
              "e. cap-and-trade).",
              "Trading programs are cost-effective approaches to environmental protection because firms are granted the flexibility to either reduce their own emissions or purchase pollution \u201callowances\u201d from other firms who have reduced below their required level.",

              "and nutrients trading programs (between water polluting firms and agricultural producers) that aim to reduce excessive loading of fertilizer and pesticides into water bodies.",
              "Fees, charges, and taxes are widely used incentives which generally place a per unit monetary charge (or fee or tax) on pollution emissions or waste to reduce the overall quantity.",
              "The main drawback is that fees, charges and taxes cannot guarantee a specific amount of pollution reduction, only that those who pollute will be penalized.",
              "Examples include pollution taxes, water user fees, wastewater discharge fees, and solid waste disposal fees.",
              "Subsidies are forms of financial government support for activities believed to be environmentally friendly.",
              "Rather than charging a polluter for emissions, a subsidy rewards a polluter for reducing emissions.",

              "Take, for example, a beverage container recycling program.",
              "First, a product charge or tax is initiated that increases the upfront cost of purchasing the container.",

              "Deposit-refund systems are also available for lead-acid batteries, automobile parts, pesticide containers, propane gas containers, large paper drums, and beer keys.",
              "Pollution standards set specific emissions limits, and thereby reduce the chance of excessively high damages to health or the environment but may impose large costs on polluters.",
              "Emissions taxes restrict costs by allowing polluting sources to pay a tax on the amount they emit, but because there are no emission limits, taxes leave open the possibility that pollution may be excessively high.",
              "A combination of standards and pricing mechanisms, referred to as a \"safety-valve\", may be used to limit both costs and pollution in these cases.",
              "This combination imposes the same emissions standard on all polluters and all polluters are then subject to a unit tax for emissions in excess of the standard.",
              "This policy combination has some attractive features.",
              "First, if the standard is set properly, proper protection of health and the environment will be assured since the standard provides protection against excessively damaging pollution levels.",
              "Second, high abatement cost polluters can defray costs by paying the emissions fee instead of cleaning up.",
              "Liability assignment is most often targeted at producers of waste or emissions that are easily identifiable and hazardous to public health.",
              "The purpose of liability is to not only hold polluters accountable for the proper management and disposal of their waste or emissions, but also for cleanup and remediation costs.",
              "There are two major U.",
              "S.",
              "laws that are liability-based: the Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.",
              "These two laws not only give polluters an incentive to make more careful and socially conscious decisions, but also hold them financially responsible to the victims of pollution.",
              "Information disclosure programs are designed to influence firm behavior through the dissemination of information on items such as production processes, labor standards, and pollution levels, to the federal, state and local government agencies, or to the public.",
              "By making business owners, employees, shareholders and customers a part of the regulatory process, all parties have an incentive to practice behavior that is socially responsible.",
              "Both voluntary and mandatory reporting programs exist in the United States.",
              "An example of a mandatory information disclosure program is the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).",
              "NEPA requires federal agencies to prepare Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) for any activities that could significantly effect the environment.",
              "An EIS is a report specifying potential environmental damages and alternative approaches to the agency action to minimize adverse impacts.",
              "Labeling schemes are widely used voluntary reporting programs. Generally, a non-profit organization or government agency sets standards for a product to meet environmentally sustainable goals.",
              "Companies who meet these goals are allowed to place the label\u2019s seal on their product, which will potentially make the product more appealing to consumers.",
              "Voluntary programs are useful for policy-makers who wish to test potential policy options or who want to encourage better production or consumption practices.",
              "Goals of voluntary actions include providing participating firms with a competitive edge (firms that participate in a voluntary program might have larger social appeal than those that do not), increase-value added to businesses, and reduce pollution.",
              "Most voluntary programs are designed and implemented by the U.",
              "S.",
              "Environmental Protection Agency.",
              "There are several benefits available to companies who wish to join a voluntary program.",
              "First, participation can improve their public image.",
              "Second, the program might offer technical or other types of assistance in exchange for participation.",
              "Third, because voluntary programs are sometimes initiated as a pilot test to a regulation, participation can help the company to more quickly transition to a formal law, and possible limit potential litigation and monitoring and enforcement costs.",
              "A general problem with voluntary action programs is that it is quantitatively difficult to assess the success of the program.",
              "Program evaluators have developed several statistical methods, however, to research success rates.",
              "The selection of the most appropriate market-based incentive or hybrid regulatory approach depends on a wide variety of factors, including: Market-based or hybrid instruments aim to address two main types of market failure.",
              "The first is the failure of firms or consumers to integrate into their decision-making the impact of their production or consumption decisions on entities external to themselves.",
              "Market-based or hybrid instruments that incorporate the costs of environmental externalities from pollution (i.",
              "e., or unintended consequences such as damages to human and environmental health) into their analysis address this market failure.",
              "The second type of market failure is the inability of firms or consumers to make optimal decisions due to lack of information on investment options, available abatement technologies, or associated risks.",
              "Information disclosure or labeling are often suggested when this occurs because policy makers believe that private and public sector decision-makers will act to address an environmental problem once information has been disseminated.",
              "The use of a particular market-oriented approach is often directly associated with the nature of the environmental problem.",
              "Do emissions derive from a point source or a non-point source?",
              "Do emissions stem from a stock or flow pollutant?",
              "Are emissions uniformly mixed or do they vary by location?",
              "Does pollution originate from stationary or mobile sources?",
              "Point sources, which emit at identifiable and specific locations, are much easier to identify and control than diffuse and often numerous non-point sources, and therefore are often amenable to the use of a wide variety of market instruments.",
              "Although non-point sources are not regulated under EPA, the pollution emitted from a non-point source is.",
              "This makes the monitoring and control of non-point source emissions a challenge.",
              "In instances where both point and non-point sources contribute to a pollution problem, a good case can be made for a tax-subsidy combination or a tradable permits system.",
              "Under such a system, emissions from point sources might be taxed while non-point source controls are subsidized.",
              "Flow pollutants tend to dissipate quickly, while stock pollutants persist in the environment and tend to accumulate over time.",
              "While it is possible to rely on a wide variety of market and hybrid instruments for the control of flow pollutants, stock pollutants may require strict limits to prevent bioaccumulation or detrimental health effects at small doses, making direct regulation potentially more appealing.",
              "If the limit is not close to zero, then a standard-and-pricing approach or a marketable permit approach that defines particular trading ratios to ensure that emission standards are not violated at any given source are potentially practical options.",
              "These same instruments are appealing when pollutants are not uniformly mixed across space.",
              "In this case, it is important to account for differences in baseline pollution levels, and in emissions across more and less polluted areas.",
              "Stationary sources of pollution are easier to identify and control through a variety of market instruments than are mobile sources.",
              "Highly mobile sources are usually numerous, each emitting a small amount of pollution.",
              "Emissions therefore vary by location and damages may vary by time of day or season.",
              "For example, health impacts associated with vehicle traffic are primarily a problem at rush hour when roads are congested and cars spend time idling or in stop-and-go traffic.",
              "Differential pricing of resources used by these mobile sources (such as higher tolls on roads or greater subsidies to public transportation during rush hour) is a potentially useful tool.",
              "The choice between price-based instruments (e.",
              "g. taxes or charges) and quantity-based instruments (e.",
              "g. marketable permits) also has been shown theoretically to rest on the degree of uncertainty surrounding the estimated benefits and costs of pollution control as well as on how marginal benefits and costs change with the stringency of the pollution control target.",
              "If uncertainty associated with the costs of abatement exists and policymakers wish to guard against potential high costs borne by polluters as a result of regulation, then they can limit these costs by using a price instrument.",
              "If, on the other hand, more uncertainty associated with the benefits of controlling pollution exist and policymakers wish to guard against high environmental damages, they can limit these damages by using a quantity instrument.",
              "The policymaker also should be aware of any discontinuities or threshold values above which sudden large changes in damages or costs could occur due to a small increase in the level of abatement required.",
              "Market power is a type of market failure in and of itself, resulting in output that is too low and prices that are too high compared to what would occur in a competitive market.",
              "Instruments that cause firms to further restrict output may create additional inefficiencies in sectors in which firms have some amount of market power.",
              "A combination of market-based instruments may work more effectively than a single instrument in this instance.",
              "In addition, to the extent that cost burdens are differentiated, the use of certain market-based instruments may cause a change in market structure to favor existing firms, creating barriers of entry and allowing these firms a certain degree of control over price.",
              "Permit systems that set aside a certain number of permits for new firms, for instance, may guard against such barriers.",
              "Market-oriented instruments differ in the degree of difficulty required to monitor and enforce them.",
              "For example, subsidies, deposit-refund systems, and information disclosure shift the burden of proof to demonstrate compliance from government to regulated entities.",
              "Because firms generally are in a better position than government to monitor and report their own emissions, they may do so at a potentially lower cost.",
              "This feature makes these approaches attractive when monitoring is difficult or emissions must be estimated (e.",
              "g. when there are non-point sources or large numbers of small polluters).",
              "In these cases, attempts to prohibit or tax the actions of polluters are likely to fail due to the risk of widespread noncompliance (e.",
              "g. illegal dumping to avoid the tax) and costly enforcement.",
              "Analysts should also consider the potential distortionary effects of market-based instruments.",
              "Instruments that include a revenue-raising component, such as auctioned permits or taxes, may allow for opportunities to direct collected resources to the reduction of market inefficiencies.",
              "Finally, the goals of policymakers may influence the instrument selected to regulate pollution.",
              "Each instrument considered may have different distributional and equity implications for both costs and benefits that should be accounted for when deciding among instruments.",
              "For example, policymakers may wish to ensure clean-up of future pollution by firms. In this case, insurance and financial assurance mechanisms may be useful instruments to supplement existing standards and rules when there is a significant risk that sources of future pollution might be incapable of financing the required pollution control or damage mitigation method.",
              "In addition, the level at which policymakers allow the market to determine exact outcomes may influence the instrument chosen.",
              "Marketable permits, for example, set the total level of pollution control, but the market determines which polluters reduce emissions.",
              "On the other hand, taxes let the market determine the extent of control by individual polluters and the total level of control."

As for monetary contribution, for example, an individual who takes actions to alleviate his or her sense of obligation to help improve environmental quality may not take any further actions when he or she realizes that others do not cooperate (i.",

              "g., household energy consumption report) could change and develop more environmentally-oriented behaviors because of the self-evaluation/-enhancement process [45, 67].",
              "Therefore, external social influence is a factor that could positively impact pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "However, in some cases, external social influence could discourage environmental conservation.",
              "For instance, one study revealed that comparison feedback might perform poorly in encouraging environmental conservation (e.",
              "g., soil conservation) because terracing is a demanding soil conservation practice and farmers have a low perception of environmental issues [68].",
              "Thus, if there is a relatively low individual perception of an environmental issue, external social influence may also fail to promote pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "In another example, when asking people how much they are willing to contribute to environmental conservation, individuals will report lower conservation efforts if they know that their profiles and results are invisible to others.",
              "People may act collectively but regardless of the demand of the social situation if they know that others cannot observe their actions [69, 70].",
              "For example, if a community could not observe forest owners\u2019 behaviors and if there were no regulator to monitor them, then forest owners would collectively choose deforestation, even with strong social expectations (social norms) that forest conservation is essential for society [71, 72].",
              "Regarding the forest plot in Fig 3, most of the studies in the literature suggest a positive effect of internal social influence on pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "In addition to the forest plot, our meta-regression results in Table 3 suggest that internal social influence has a positive and significant effect on pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "The standardized coefficients reported in Table 3 (column 5) indicate that the internal social influences that motivate people to change their perceptions and attitudes are significant to promote pro-environmental behaviors (the standardized coefficient is 0.",

              "4680).",
              "Thus, internal social motives that help guide people to change their perceptions and attitudes toward a sustainable behavior could be more efficient than the external social influence [16, 17, 20].",
              "For instance, one study has suggested that altering individuals\u2019 perceptions by providing different visual attention to climate information (e.",
              "g., global temperature change) could reinforce their beliefs and motivations to take actions to mitigate climate change [73, 74].",
              "Our results suggest that the effect of network connection is relatively strong, with the standardized coefficient equals 0.",
              "344 (see the results in Table 3).",
              "In one study, the authors showed that network has an indirect impact on ecological health because it helps to share information and knowledge across individuals and to promote cooperation among members of the network [75].",
              "On the other hand, individuals are less likely to take a conservation action because they fear that their neighbors may free-ride on their efforts, such as restoring soil functions or investing in fertility improvements [76, 77].",
              "Thus, a stronger network connection (i.",
              "e., a denser network), the main characteristic of network structure, is an effective social incentive to enhance environmental behavioral changes.",
              "Several studies have indicated that larger network size is responsible for weaker network connection or less social interaction because individuals in a society or group only make contact or frequently interact with others living close to them [78\u201380].",
              "Our forest plot (Fig 5) suggests that network size does not affect pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "Meta-regression results also support this finding by indicating that other groups of social incentives positively affect pro-environmental behaviors compared to network size (as the base category).",
              "It should be noted that the effect of network size corresponds to the regression intercept.",
              "The latter also corresponds to the overall effect size in the meta-regression.",
              "Moreover, it represents the effect of the base category for other groups of dummies (more precisely, census data among types of data collection methods and Europe among geographical regions).",
              "Consequently, we cannot separately identify the overall effect size, the effect of network size, and the effect of the base category for other dummy groups.",
              "A simple meta-regression without variables of interest (i.",
              "e., social incentives) and any control variable gives a very rough estimation of the overall effect size (see S6 Table, also corresponding to a test for publication bias).",
              "When this meta-regression model is augmented by social incentive dummies (see Table 3, columns 1\u2019 and 3\u2019 using effect size coefficient and partial correlation coefficient as dependent variables, respectively), the intercept may become (significantly or not) negative.",
              "This is because the intercept also includes the effect of the base category of social incentives (i.",

              "Hence, increasing network size will not result in a better environmental outcome, ceteris paribus.",
              "By comparing this result with the network connection, we would expect that if an increase in the network size is accompanied by an increased degree of connection between individuals, the adverse effect of network size can be more than offset by the positive effect of connections between individuals, leading to a pro-environmental action.",
              "In other words, when requiring this combination of network size and network connection, the point of vigilance must be to observe the necessary condition of an increase in the connection.",
              "In order to have a sustainable network, the presence of a good leader appears to be necessary.",
              "This leader is responsible for providing information and keeping people connected.",
              "For example, some studies showed that a \u201cblock leadership\u201d approach treatment has a positive impact on the recycling rate of households because a leader plays a vital role in sustaining a connection and providing needed information to households within the leader\u2019s network [81, 82].",
              "Block leaders are defined as volunteers who help inform people in their groups about a specific issue.",
              "However, the coefficient of leadership in our meta-analysis regression is statistically insignificant compared to the network size (see Table 3).",
              "This result is not surprising because, among the positively significant results of leadership, some studies reported the positively small and even negative impact of leadership on pro-environmental behaviors (see the forest plot in Fig 5).",
              "For example, one study indicated that the presence of a leader in groups that have the autonomy to craft governance rules for their environmental resource could encourage the group\u2019s collective actions toward resource conservation but discourage resource conservation when groups are subject to rules imposed by others [26].",
              "A detailed analysis of the autonomy to craft governance rules would be interesting but is beyond the scope of this paper.",
              "Thus, it would be interesting for future studies to take it into account when studying the impact of leadership on pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "We also re-estimated the model by excluding one paper that reported a negative impact of leadership and obtained the same results.",
              "We can be confident that an outlier is not present in our data.",
              "Our meta-analysis results (Table 3) show that trust in institutions is a driver of pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "A lack of trust in government can lead to a negative individual perception of an institutional design/government program and prevent the individual from participating in it.",
              "For example, a well-designed agri-environmental contract cannot completely replace a farmer\u2019s trust in government institutions [83].",
              "The existing literature has also suggested that the rate of participation in an environmental program can be increased by motivating people and by maintaining and developing institutional trustworthiness [84, 85].",
              "Regarding the forest plot in Fig 6, trust in others has an overall positive effect on pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "Similar to trust in institutions, maintaining trustworthiness between individuals has a positive impact on behavioral changes, as shown by numerous studies [86].",
              "However, our meta-regression results cannot confirm the significant impact of trust in others on pro-environmental behaviors (see Table 3).",
              "Some of the existing literature suggests that trust in others may fail to motivate new attitudes about environmental issues and pollution [87].",
              "In their study, the authors argued that a higher level of trust within a close network could cultivate a sense of comfort and security and thus makes people less likely to respond to less immediate and indirectly observable environmental issues.",
              "One study indicated that trust in others performing resource conservation behaviors might have a low impact on resource extraction because of the subtractability property of the common resource (i.",
              "e., consuming an additional common resource would decrease the available resources for others) [88].",
              "As a result, because of the resource constraint, individuals who trust in others performing resource conservation feel that they have no choice but to harvest whatever the environment provides.",
              "Regarding the robustness of our estimation results, we classified pro-environmental behaviors into three different groups, including environmental conservation, environmental consumption and general pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "The detailed classification of the dependent variable is reported in S8 Table.",
              "Indeed, conservation efforts are more likely to have positive spillovers on others (i.",
              "e., positive externalities) and also more likely to be observed by others (i.",
              "e., visibility or observability) than consumption efforts (e.",
              "g., eating green).",
              "We observe that the social incentive factors play a crucial role in promoting environmental conservation rather than environmental consumption and general pro-environmental behaviors (the estimation results are reported in S9 Table).",
              "Alternatively, we checked the robustness by classifying the observed pro-environmental behaviors into two different groups, including high dependency (i.",
              "e., pro-environmental behaviors that highly depend on the critical contribution of others to ensure their successes) and low dependency, which is otherwise the pro-environmental behaviors that less likely depend on the critical contribution of others to ensure their success.",
              "The detailed definitions of these two classifications are reported in S8 Table.",
              "Indeed, similar to public good contributions, some kinds of pro-environmental behaviors like recycling or workplace pro-environmental behaviors require the contributions of many other fellow citizens to ensure their success.",
              "For instance, individuals are more likely to contribute to a public good if they observe that others also contribute [46, 89].",
              "Estimation results reported in S9 Table suggests that social incentive factors play a significant role only when pro-environmental behaviors highly depend on the contribution of others.",
              "Our results suggest that policymakers should focus on at least three issues to promote pro-environmental behaviors in society.",
              "Firstly, we found that internal social influence is the most important social incentive that positively affects pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "This result means that internal social influence that motivates people to change their perceptions and attitudes is extremely important and necessary to promote pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "In addition to internal social influence, our results suggest that external social influence also positively impacts pro-environmental behaviors but is less effective than internal influences.",
              "This result aligns with the existing literature that holds that internal social motives are better than external ones because they guide people into changing their behaviors.",
              "In contrast, external influences can drive people to perform a specific action through compliance and identification, but it is not enough to motivate them to change their perceptions and attitudes toward a sustainable behavior [16, 17, 20].",
              "This finding implies that the impacts of an environmental policy can be under-estimated if policymakers do not include social influence in their decisions regarding environmental issues.",
              "Therefore, based on our meta-analysis results, effective environmental policies should focus on strengthening individuals\u2019 personal norms by fostering environmental awareness and the sense of obligation toward eco-friendly behaviors (e.",
              "g., improving green education and providing environmental information).",
              "Secondly, since network is a valuable source of knowledge and information for individuals, the effectiveness of a conservation policy can be improved only if connections or interactions among individuals are increased.",
              "This result does not support an existing conjecture [90], which hypothesizes that increasing interactions between individuals in a large structure can be harmful to collective conservation behaviors.",
              "One example validating our results relates to pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in a spatial coordination game [91], consisting of giving agglomeration bonuses to people who interact in an enlarged network.",
              "It was shown that these bonuses could enhance coordination towards environmental conservation programs. In addition to the agglomeration bonus that encourages people to collaborate in a network to achieve an environmental target (i.",
              "e., collective actions), policymakers could also try to establish conditions under which individuals could share their knowledge to better drive them toward more sustainable behaviors (e.",
              "g., a favorable regulatory framework for environmental associations/groups).",
              "Finally, we found that trust in institutions (e.",
              "g., governments, institutions or leaders) is needed to ensure a positive impact on pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "It is important because citizens\u2019 trust in government can dictate individual behaviors to shape policy design and generate desired policy outcomes.",
              "For instance, trust in institutions could reduce the risk of free-riding and opportunistic behaviors as citizens would be willing to sacrifice some immediate personal benefits (e.",
              "g., by contributing to common goods) if they have positive expectations of the long-term outcomes of the government\u2019s policies [92].",

              "Therefore, external social influence is a factor that could positively impact pro-environmental behaviors.",
              "However, in some cases, external social influence could discourage environmental conservation.",
              "For instance, one study revealed that comparison feedback might perform poorly in encouraging environmental conservation (e.",

              "Block leaders are defined as volunteers who help inform people in their groups about a specific issue.",
              "However, the coefficient of leadership in our meta-analysis regression is statistically insignificant compared to the network size (see Table 3).",
              "This result is not surprising because, among the positively significant results of leadership, some studies reported the positively small and even negative impact of leadership on pro-environmental behaviors (see the forest plot in Fig 5).",
              "For example, one study indicated that the presence of a leader in groups that have the autonomy to craft governance rules for their environmental resource could encourage the group\u2019s collective actions toward resource conservation but discourage resource conservation when groups are subject to rules imposed by others [26].",

              "In their study, the authors argued that a higher level of trust within a close network could cultivate a sense of comfort and security and thus makes people less likely to respond to less immediate and indirectly observable environmental issues.",

              "In contrast, external influences can drive people to perform a specific action through compliance and identification, but it is not enough to motivate them to change their perceptions and attitudes toward a sustainable behavior [16, 17, 20].",
              "This finding implies that the impacts of an environmental policy can be under-estimated if policymakers do not include social influence in their decisions regarding environmental issues.",
