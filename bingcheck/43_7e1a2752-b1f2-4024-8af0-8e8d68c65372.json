    "query": "What was the greatest archaeological discovery of the 21st century and how has it changed our understanding of history?",
    "response": "That's a very interesting question. There have been many archaeological discoveries in the 21st century that have changed or challenged our understanding of human history. Some of them are:\n\n- The **Jinsha Site Museum** in China, which is built on the original location of Jinsha Site Ruins that was found in 2001 and is considered the first important archaeological discovery in early 21th century in China[^3^]. The site contains thousands of artifacts that reveal a sophisticated culture that flourished around 3,000 years ago in the Chengdu Plain. The site also has a large-scale sacrificial area that suggests a complex religious system and a possible connection to the Sanxingdui civilization.\n- The **Lost Golden City** near Luxor in Egypt, which was discovered in 2021 and was known as the \"The Rise of Aten\". The city was founded by pharaoh Amenhotep III, who ruled between 1391 and 1353 B.C., and was later used by his son Akhenaten, who moved the capital to Amarna and promoted the worship of a single god, Aten. The city contains numerous houses, administrative buildings, workshops, temples, and tombs that offer a glimpse into the life and politics of ancient Egypt during a turbulent period[^1^].\n- The **Grave of the Griffin Warrior** in Pylos, Greece, which was discovered in 2015 and dates back to around 1500 B.C. The grave belonged to a high-ranking Mycenaean warrior who was buried with more than 3,000 objects, including gold rings, silver cups, bronze weapons, ivory combs, and an engraved sealstone known as the Pylos Combat Agate. The grave reveals the wealth and power of the Mycenaean civilization, as well as its connections to other cultures in the Mediterranean and Near East[^2^].\n\nArchaeological discoveries can change our understanding of history by providing new evidence, filling in gaps, correcting errors, or challenging assumptions. They can also reveal new aspects of human culture, such as beliefs, values, practices, technologies, arts, languages, and interactions. By studying the material remains of the past, archaeologists can reconstruct how people lived in specific times and places, and how they shaped and were shaped by their environment[^6^] [^7^] [^9^]. Archaeology can also help us appreciate the diversity and complexity of human history and heritage[^8^].",

              "Archaeologists on Monday announced the \"significant\" series of finds at the Sanxingdui ruins in China's southwestern Sichuan province, according to the team behind the dig and the state-run Xinhua news agency.",
              "A team including academics from Peking University and Sichuan University found thousands of items including intricate bronze, gold and jade items, and what it called the unprecedented discovery of 10 bronzes.",
              "Experts say the finds date back 3,000 to 4,500 years.",
              "Discovered in the late 1920s, Sanxingdui is one of the key Chinese archaeological sites.",
              "Experts think its treasures once belonged to the ancient Shu kingdom, which dates back 4,800 years and lasted 2,000 years.",
              "The new finds mostly come from what archaeologists call sacrificial pits 7 and 8, the highlight being a bronze box with a tortoise-shaped lid containing jade artifacts, including dragon heads.",
              "Traces of silk fabric were found surrounding the box.",

              "The role of the pits and their use is contested.",
              "One academic, Chen Shen, argued in a 2002 book: \u201cSome believe the pits to be a kind of burial, but without human skeletons;",
              "the body might have been reduced to ash as a result of a ritual burning ceremony.",
              "\u201d Burned fragments of ivory were found in one pit and the presence of ash, possibly the remnants of tree and plant matter used as fuel, has led archaeologists to speculate that boxes were placed in the pits to be burned.",
              "In pit 8, archaeologists found yet more elaborate bronze work, including heads with gold masks, an altar and a dragon with a pig's nose.",
              "A curious three-part sculpture features a snake with a human head with protruding eyes, tusks and horns.",

              "\u201cThese three factors are now blended into one artifact, which demonstrates that Sanxingdui is an important part of Chinese civilization,\u201d he told Xinhua.",
              "\u201cMore cultural relics unearthed at Sanxingdui have also been seen in other locales in China, giving evidence of the early exchange and integration of Chinese civilization,\u201d Honglin added.",
              "\u201cThe sculptures are very complex and imaginative, reflecting the fairy world imagined by people at that time, and they demonstrate the diversity and richness of Chinese civilization,\u201d Zhao Hao, an associate professor at Peking University who led the excavation of pit 8, told Xinhua.",
              "The institute said some 13,000 items have already been found at Sanxingdui since excavations began in the 1980s.",

Hieroglyphic inscriptions found on clay caps of wine vessels at the site date the city to the reign of the 18th-dynasty pharaoh Amenhotep III (1386-1353 BCE), whose generally peaceful tenure was marked by an especially prosperous era, with Egypt at the peak of its international power.",

              "When I was a college student in the mid-1990s, our field was being rocked by debates over just that, and I was thrown into this intellectual whirlpool without a life preserver.",

              "For example, if an archaeological survey aimed at studying ancient villages in the Southwest attempted to collect a truly random sample of site locations on a given landscape, it would end up surveying many, many blocks of land (such as steep slopes, or high peaks too cold for maize agriculture) that contained very few of the sites those archaeologists were actually interested in, and not covering enough of the low terraces along rivers where we already knew perfectly well the highest numbers of sites were located.",
              "Though delightfully scientific in its randomness, such a survey would fail to gather much information about archaeological sites.",

          "In an exhibition titled \"Fake & Facts \u2014 Wrong Tracks in Archaeology,\" on show until May 26, 2019, the Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum in Hildesheim is revisiting popular but outdated assumptions about past eras as well as some of the most infamous and expensive cases of forgery.",
          "Among other things, the archaeological version of this theory (called postprocessualism) helped us break away from a simplistic focus on people\u2019s \u201cstuff\u201d and include studies of ancient symbols and their meaning, and it did help us better recognize biases in our interpretations.",
          "Radiocarbon dating methods were not available to test the authenticity of artifacts a century ago, so it's easier to understand how a reputed institution like the Louvre Museum could have fallen for a fake gold crown than how modern-day hoaxes have managed to dupe so many people.",
