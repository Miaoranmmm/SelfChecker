    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. I'm glad you are interested in the history of mathematics. There are many fascinating facts and stories about how mathematics developed over time and influenced various fields of science and culture. Here are some examples:\n\n- The word \"hundred\" originally meant 120, not 100. It comes from the Old Norse word \"hundrath\", which was a unit of measurement equal to 120 items[^2^].\n- The number 7 is considered the most popular number among people, possibly because it has some unique properties in arithmetic. For example, it is the only single-digit prime number that is not a factor or a multiple of any other single-digit number[^2^].\n- The name Google comes from the word \"googol\", which is a mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros. It was coined by the nephew of the mathematician Edward Kasner in 1938[^2^].\n- If you multiply 111,111,111 by itself, you get 12,345,678,987,654,321, which contains all the digits from 0 to 9 in order[^2^].\n- There is an elegant equation that involves five of the most important constants in mathematics: e^i*pi + 1 = 0. This equation is known as Euler's identity and it connects the concepts of exponentiation, imaginary numbers, pi, zero and one[^2^].\n- The only time Shakespeare used the word \"mathematics\" in his works was in the play \"The Taming of the Shrew\", where he wrote: \"And do as adversaries do in law / Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends / For I have heard of many a learned man / That hath been ruined by his mathematics\"[^2^].\n- The symbol \"=\" for equality was invented by the Welsh mathematician Robert Recorde in 1557. He chose two parallel lines because \"no two things can be more equal\"[^3^].\n- The first woman known to have contributed to mathematics was Hypatia of Alexandria, who lived in the 4th and 5th centuries CE. She was a philosopher, astronomer and teacher who wrote commentaries on geometry and algebra[^3^].\n- If you add up all the natural numbers from 1 to 100, you get 5050. This formula was discovered by the young Gauss when he was asked to do this tedious calculation by his teacher[^3^].\n- The number zero was not represented in Roman numerals. It was derived from the Arabic word \"sifr\", which also gave rise to the words \"cipher\" and \"zero\" in English[^2^].\n- One of the greatest achievements in mathematics was the development of calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz in the 17th century. Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and curves. It has applications in physics, engineering, economics and more[^4^].\n- One of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century was Emmy Noether, who was a German Jewish woman who faced discrimination and persecution. She made groundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics, especially on the connection between symmetry and conservation laws[^1^].\n- One of the most challenging problems in mathematics is the Riemann hypothesis, which is about the distribution of prime numbers. It was proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1859 and it remains unsolved to this day. A prize of $1 million is offered for anyone who can prove or disprove it[^4^].\n- One of the most surprising discoveries in mathematics was that some statements are undecidable, meaning that they cannot be proven or disproven by any logical system. This was shown by Kurt G\u00f6del and Alan Turing in the 1930s and it has implications for philosophy, computer science and artificial intelligence[^1^].\n- One of the most fascinating concepts in mathematics is chaos theory, which studies how small changes in initial conditions can lead to unpredictable and complex outcomes. This is also known as the butterfly effect. Some examples of chaotic systems are weather patterns, population dynamics and cryptography[^1^].\n\nI hope you enjoyed these facts about mathematics.

              "Long hundred - Wikipedia",
              "The long hundred, also known as the great hundred or twelfty,[1] is the number 120 (in base-10 Hindu-Arabic numerals) that was referred to as hund, hund-teontig, hundra\u00f0, hundrath, or hundred in Germanic languages prior to the 15th century, and is now known as one hundred twenty, or six score.",
              "The number was translated into Latin in Germanic-speaking countries as centum (Roman numeral C), but the qualifier long is now added because English now uses hundred exclusively to refer to the number of five score (100) instead.",
              "The long hundred was 120, but the long thousand was reckoned decimally as 10 long hundreds (1200).",
              "The hundred (Latin: centena) was an English unit of measurement used in the production, sale and taxation of various items in the medieval kingdom of England.",
              "The value was often different from 100 units, mostly because of the continued medieval use of the Germanic long hundred of 120.",
              "The unit's use as a measure of weight is now described as a hundredweight.",
              "The Latin edition of the Assize of Weights and Measures, one of the statutes of uncertain date from around 1300, describes hundreds of (red) herring (a long hundred of 120 fish), beeswax, sugar, pepper, cumin, and alum (\"13+1/2 stone, each stone containing 8 pounds\" or 108 Tower lbs.)",
              ", coarse and woven linen, hemp canvas (a long hundred of 120 ells), and iron or horseshoes and shillings (a short hundred of 100 pieces).",
              "[2] Later versions used the Troy or the avoirdupois pound in their reckonings instead and included hundreds of fresh herrings (a short hundred of 100 fish), cinnamon, nutmegs (13+1/2 stone of 8 lb), and garlic (\"15 ropes of 15 heads\" or 225 heads).",
              "[3] The existence of a non-decimal base in the earliest traces of the Germanic languages is attested by the presence of glosses such as \"tenty-wise\" or \"ten-count\" to denote that certain numbers are to be understood as decimal.",
              "Such glosses would not be expected where decimal counting was usual.",
              "In the Gothic Bible,[4] some marginalia glosses a five hundred (fimf hundram) in the text as being understood taihuntewjam (\"tenty-wise\").",
              "Similar words are known in most other Germanic languages.",
              "Old Norse counted large numbers in twelves of tens, with its words \"one hundred and eighty\" (hundra\u00f0 ok a\u0301tta tigir) meaning 200, \"two hundred\" (tvau hundra\u00f0) meaning 240 and \"thousand\" (\u00feu\u0301sund, Old English: \u00feu\u0301send) meaning 1200.",
              "[5] The word to signify 100 (a \"short hundred\") was originally 100, ti\u0301u tigir (lit.",
              "'ten tens').",
              "The use of the long hundred in medieval England and Scotland is documented by Stevenson[6] and Goodare although the latter notes that it was sometimes avoided by using numbers such as \"seven score\".",
              "[7] The Assize of Weights and Measures, one of England's statutes of uncertain date from c.",
              "1300, shows both the short and long hundred in competing use.",
              "The hundred of kippers is formed by six score fish and the hundred of hemp canvas and linen cloth is formed by six score ells, but the hundred of pounds, to be used in measuring bulk goods, is five times twenty, and the hundred of fresh herring is five score fish.",
              "[8] Within the original Latin text, the numeral c.",
              "is used for a value of 120: Et quodlibet c.",
              "continet vi.",
              "xx.",
              "(\"And each such 'hundred' contains six twenties.\"",
              ")[2] Once the short hundred began coming into use, Old Norse referred to the long hundred as hundra\u00f0 tolf-roett (lit.",
              "'duodecimal hundred'), as opposed to the short hundra\u00f0 ti-r\u00e6tt (lit.",
              "'decimal hundred').",
              "The reckoning by long hundreds waned as Arabic numerals which require the uniform base 10, spread throughout Europe during and after the 14th century.",

              "If you're into this sort of thing, I highly recommend checking out Bellos' new book, The Grapes of Math (Alex Through the Looking-Glass in the UK), in which he discusses his survey in greater detail, the cultural significance of seven, and other issues about our psychological responses to numbers * Bellos says that if you confined his survey to China, for example, you would probably see the number eight in pole position, but he predicts that you would see virtually no fours.",

              "But his greatest contribution is taught to every elementary school child, and it arguably laid the groundwork for modern computer science.",
              "He invented the equals sign.",

              "At age 14, he went to Oxford University.",
              "At age 21, he was teaching mathematics there, although scholarship wasn't his first career goal.",
              "Over the next few years, he also earned a degree in medicine and wrote the exquisitely titled monograph The Urinal of Physick, detailing what a physician could learn from a patient's urine.",
              "Either medicine proved less fascinating than Recorde had anticipated, or less lucrative.",
              "Over the next decade, he moved from medicine to finance and oversaw mints in Bristol, London, and Dublin.",
              "The writer's life, however, clearly appealed to him.",
              "He produced a large and varied body of work: theological tracts defending Protestantism, poems, and most importantly, textbooks.",
              "Not only did Recorde explain astronomy, geometry, and arithmetic in successive textbooks, but he explained them in English.",
              "Previous works on mathematics were written in Latin, meaning the only people who could read them already had an extensive education.",
              "Recorde wrote in English for the British layman.",
              "For these busy learners, he came up with his most famous invention.",
              "His final book, The Whetstone of Witte, published in 1557, gave the world the equals sign.",
              "Perhaps a man trained to study urine and keep control over currency has a pragmatic mind.",
              "Recorde found it irritating to have to state over and over that one side of an equation was equal to the other side.",
              "He wrote, with obvious annoyance and whimsical spelling, \"And to avoide the tedious repetition of these woordes, is equalle to, I will sette as I doe often in woorke use, a paire of paralleles.\"",

              "His instruction on how to apply mathematics to areas such as commerce, land surveying, navigation, and astronomy imposed a new mindset on people who would previously have talked about quantity in vague terms such as \"a goodlie amount and a fair distance.\"",
              "Recorde helped introduce precision, exact quantification, and accurate comparison in everyday life.",
              "Recorde also, it is clear, ushered in a new way of talking about numbers.",
              "Picking and choosing from Latin and German texts, he introduced English speakers to words like \"linear,\" \"denominate,\" \"binomial,\" and \"equation.\"",
              "He introduced mathematical meanings for words like \"square,\" \"compound,\" \"rational,\" and \"irrational.\"",
              "Robert Recorde taught people to speak a mathematical, or more importantly, a computational language.",
              "His most famous invention is still part of this computational language.",
              "The equals sign was first used as part of a computer programming language in FORTRAN I, in 1957.",

              "Today, computer programmers reap the benefit of Recorde's work in inventing a precise, quantifiable, and efficient symbolic language to describe the world.",
              "Sadly, Recorde wasn't lauded as a hero of rationality and math education in his lifetime.",
              "Brilliant as he was, he forgot one of the basic rules of his day: the aristocracy always wins.",
              "Recorde was relieved of his position at the Dublin mint by the Earl of Pembroke.",
              "Whether this was because of a setback at some silver mines Recorde was assigned to develop or because he was a Protestant when devoutly Catholic Queen Mary rose to the throne is up for debate.",

              "[1] Other common uses include year numbers on monuments and buildings and copyright dates on the title screens of movies and television programs. MCM, signifying \"a thousand, and a hundred less than another thousand\", means 1900, so 1912 is written MCMXII.",

              "The current year is MMXXIV (2024).",
              "Roman numerals use different symbols for each power of ten and there is no zero symbol, in contrast with the place value notation of Arabic numerals (in which place-keeping zeros enable the same digit to represent different powers of ten).",
              "This allows some flexibility in notation, and there has never been an official or universally accepted standard for Roman numerals.",
              "Usage varied greatly in ancient Rome and became thoroughly chaotic in medieval times.",

              "[33] However, the explanation does not seem to apply to IIIXX and IIIC, since the Latin words for 17 and 97 were septendecim (seven ten) and nonaginta septem (ninety seven), respectively.",

              "Some of these variants may have been regarded as errors even by contemporaries.",
              "As Roman numerals are composed of ordinary alphabetic characters, there may sometimes be confusion with other uses of the same letters.",
              "For example, \"XXX\" and \"XL\" have other connotations in addition to their values as Roman numerals, while \"IXL\" more often than not is a gramogram of \"I excel\", and is in any case not an unambiguous Roman numeral.",
              "[40] As a non-positional numeral system, Roman numerals have no \"place-keeping\" zeros.",
              "Furthermore, the system as used by the Romans lacked a numeral for the number zero itself (that is, what remains after 1 is subtracted from 1).",
              "The word nulla (the Latin word meaning \"none\") was used to represent 0, although the earliest attested instances are medieval.",

              "[43] The use of N to indicate \"none\" long survived in the historic apothecaries' system of measurement: used well into the 20th century to designate quantities in pharmaceutical prescriptions.",
              "[44] The base \"Roman fraction\" is S, indicating 1\u20442.",
              "The use of S (as in VIIS to indicate 71\u20442) is attested in some ancient inscriptions[45] and also in the now rare apothecaries' system (usually in the form SS):[44] but while Roman numerals for whole numbers are essentially decimal, S does not correspond to 5\u204410, as one might expect, but 6\u204412.",
              "The Romans used a duodecimal rather than a decimal system for fractions, as the divisibility of twelve (12 = 22 \u00d7 3) makes it easier to handle the common fractions of 1\u20443 and 1\u20444 than does a system based on ten (10 = 2 \u00d7 5).",
              "Notation for fractions other than 1\u20442 is mainly found on surviving Roman coins, many of which had values that were duodecimal fractions of the unit as.",
              "Fractions less than 1\u20442 are indicated by a dot (\u00b7) for each uncia \"twelfth\", the source of the English words inch and ounce;",

              "Six twelfths (one half), is S for semis \"half\".",
              "Uncia dots were added to S for fractions from seven to eleven twelfths, just as tallies were added to V for whole numbers from six to nine.",
              "[46] The arrangement of the dots was variable and not necessarily linear.",
              "Five dots arranged like (\u2059) (as on the face of a die) are known as a quincunx, from the name of the Roman fraction/coin.",
              "The Latin words sextans and quadrans are the source of the English words sextant and quadrant.",
              "Each fraction from 1\u204412 to 12\u204412 had a name in Roman times;",
              "these corresponded to the names of the related coins: Other Roman fractional notations included the following: The Romans developed two main ways of writing large numbers, the apostrophus and the vinculum, further extended in various ways in later times.",
              "Using the apostrophus method,[47] 500 is written as I\u2183, while 1,000 is written as CI\u2183.",
              "[20] This system of encasing numbers to denote thousands (imagine the Cs and \u2183s as parentheses) had its origins in Etruscan numeral usage.",
              "Each additional set of C and \u2183 surrounding CI\u2183 raises the value by a factor of ten: CCI\u2183\u2183 represents 10,000 and CCCI\u2183\u2183\u2183 represents 100,000.",
              "Similarly, each additional \u2183 to the right of I\u2183 raises the value by a factor of ten: I\u2183\u2183 represents 5,000 and I\u2183\u2183\u2183 represents 50,000.",

              "Using the vinculum, conventional Roman numerals are multiplied by 1,000 by adding a \"bar\" or \"overline\", thus:[49] The vinculum came into use in the late Republic,[50] and it was a common alternative to the apostrophic \u2180 during the Imperial era around the Roman world (M for '1000' was not in use until the Medieval period).",
              "[51] [52] It continued in use in the Middle Ages, though it became known more commonly as titulus,[53] and it appears in modern editions of classical and medieval Latin texts.",

              "Both usages can be seen on Roman inscriptions of the same period and general location, such as on the Antonine Wall.",
              "[57][58] The system is closely associated with the ancient city-state of Rome and the Empire that it created.",
              "However, due to the scarcity of surviving examples, the origins of the system are obscure and there are several competing theories, all largely conjectural.",

              "As in the basic Roman system, the Etruscans wrote the symbols that added to the desired number, from higher to lower value.",

              "Her abstract theory helped draw together many important mathematical developments.",

              "If you are famous already, you become infamous,\u201d Atiyah said during his talk.",
              "\u201cNobody believes any proof of the Riemann hypothesis because it is so difficult.",
              "Nobody has proved it, so why should anybody prove it now?",
              "Unless, of course, you have a totally new idea.",
              "\u201d Sometimes called the riddle of the primes, the Riemann hypothesis is intimately connected to the distribution of prime numbers, those indivisible by any whole number other than themselves and one.",
              "If the hypothesis is proven to be correct, mathematicians would be armed with a map to the location of all such prime numbers, a breakthrough with far-reaching repercussions in the field.",
              "Advertisement In more practical terms, a correct solution would earn its composer a $1 million prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute, which ranks the hypothesis among its the six unsolved Clay Millennium Problems. The prestige has tempted many mathematicians over the years, none of which has yet been awarded the prize.",
              "Atiyah\u2019s self-described \u201csimple proof\u201d builds on the work of two leading 20th century mathematicians, John von Neumann and Friedrich Hirzebruch.",
              "By combining their insights, and assuming the Riemann hypothesis does not hold, Atiyah claims to reach a logical contradiction, implying that the hypothesis must in fact be correct.",
              "\u201cIt looks miraculous,\u201d says Atiyah, \u201cbut I claim that all the hard work was done 70 years ago.",
              "\u201d In his talk, Atiyah gave a history of von Neumann\u2019s and Hirzebruch\u2019s work, along with other noted figures in the history of mathematics.",
              "His proof of the Riemann hypothesis was dealt with in just a few slides and claimed a connection with the fine structure constant, a physical parameter that describes the interaction between light and matter and whose status as a constant has come into question.",
              "Born in 1929, Atiyah is one of the UK\u2019s most eminent mathematical figures, having received the two awards often referred to as the Nobel prizes of mathematics, the Fields medal and the Abel Prize.",
              "He also, at various times, served as president of the London Mathematical Society, the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.",
              "Atiyah has produced a number of papers in recent years making remarkable claims which have so far failed to convince his peers.",
              "While his latest proof has yet to undergo the rigorous peer review process necessary to test its validity, the initial reaction has been one of cautious scepticism.",
              "Most mathematicians contacted by New Scientist declined to comment on the work.",
              "\u201cThe Riemann hypothesis is a notoriously difficult problem,\u201d says Nicholas Jackson at Warwick University in the UK.",
              "\u201cLots of other top-rate mathematicians have nearly but not quite managed to prove it over the years, only for a subtle flaw in the proof to become apparent.",
              "\u201d If it is borne out, however, Atiyah hopes that his proof will inspire a younger generation to extend his work to more general cases of the Riemann hypothesis, as well as seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics and even physics.",
              "\u201cHopefully some useful insights will come out of Atiyah\u2019s work even if the Riemann hypothesis proof doesn\u2019t quite hold together,\u201d says Jackson.",
