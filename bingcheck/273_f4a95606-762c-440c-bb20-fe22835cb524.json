    "response": "That's a great question. There is no single answer to this complex challenge, but there are some promising and innovative approaches that can help reduce carbon emissions from transportation, which account for about **27%** of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions[^1^].\n\nOne approach is to set **GHG emissions and fuel economy standards** for cars and trucks, which are the largest sources of greenhouse gases from transportation. This can help cut billions of metric tons of GHG emissions over the lifetimes of the vehicles sold, nearly double the fuel efficiency, and reduce America's dependence on oil[^1^].\n\nAnother approach is to increase the use of **renewable fuels**, such as biofuels, hydrogen, and electricity, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to burning fossil fuels. Renewable fuels are produced from plants, crops, and other biomass, and can also diversify the energy sources and create new economic opportunities[^1^].\n\nA third approach is to reduce the **demand** for transport by changing how often and how far we travel and move goods. This can be done by promoting more efficient modes of transportation, such as public transit, biking, and walking; by encouraging more compact and mixed-use urban development; by implementing road pricing and congestion charges; and by supporting teleworking and e-commerce[^2^] [^3^] [^4^].\n\nThese approaches are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary and synergistic. They require the collaboration of governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals to implement them on a large scale and to tackle climate change effectively.",

              "Second, there are sectors in which direct electrification and e-fuels have similar costs, or in which high uncertainty or other potential barriers to a direct electrification leave the cost comparison ambiguous.",

              "Since the large-scale availability of green hydrogen is uncertain and direct electrification is more efficient, an optimal allocation of scarce domestic renewable electricity could imply a prioritization of direct electrification.",
              "Third, there are sectors and applications for which direct electrification faces limits that can be overcome by hydrogen and e-fuels (for example, long-distance aviation and shipping, feedstock demand in the chemical industry and primary steel).",

              "From a carbon neutrality perspective, e-fuels should be targeted on sectors inaccessible to direct electrification (category 3), even if competitiveness is more within reach (that is, would require less subsidy) in some of the category 1 applications, and even if removing barriers to electrification in category 2 requires major efforts.",
              "By contrast, policies that foster hydrogen and e-fuel use in category 1 applications can substantially increase overall costs of climate change mitigation while even increasing GHG emission compared with using electricity directly, which risks public acceptance of the energy transition as a whole.",

              "E-fuels are unlikely to provide substantial contributions to 2030 climate targets, not least because their climate effectiveness hinges on a very advanced power transition (for example, a >90% renewable electricity share for transport applications), and low-carbon electricity can more efficiently reduce emissions via direct electrification.",
              "In the mid- to long term, for a large-scale production and technological progress (renewable electricity, electrolysis, DAC), e-fuel costs can become competitive solely on the basis of carbon prices.",

              "We demonstrate that wealth creation can be achieved through energy diversification rather than relying solely on conventional energy sources.",
              "Energy has long been considered a substantial driver of economic growth, and traditional energy demand, following an upward trend for many decades (Sadorsky, 2009;",
              "Ellabban et al.",
              ", 2014).",
              "However, from the beginning of the century, countries have been exposed to different energy-connected issues worldwide, and the reliance on conventional energy has generated grave international concerns (Owusu and Asumadu, 2016).",
              "It has become common knowledge that increasing use of conventional energy sources such as oil, petroleum, and coal, to achieve economic growth\u2014is associated with severe environmental degradation that affects both environment and human health.",
              "Nevertheless, emerging nations consider restrictions on carbon-intensive energy as harmful to actions targeted toward development (Edenhofer et al.",
              ", 2014).",
              "Thus, industrial states are forced to create and finance schemes to deal with climate change primarily driven by industrial operations.",
              "These problems propelled international communities and institutions to search for regular energy alternatives (Ozturk and Bilgili, 2015).",
              "Besides, specialists highlight that cleaner energy sources can actively mitigate carbon emissions and preserve environmental quality (Yildirim, 2014;",

              "The mixed empirical findings that examine the causality between energy and economy can be categorized into four main hypotheses namely the neutrality, conservation, growth, and feedback theories (Ozturk, 2010;",
              "Payne, 2010).",
              "The neutrality hypothesis highlights no causal link between energy and growth such that structural changes in economic and energy portfolio have no impact on economic and energy growth trajectory (Apergis and Payne, 2009).",
              "The conservation hypothesis confirms a causal link from growth to energy\u2014revealing that the implementation of energy conservation and management policies has no economic effect (Jakovac, 2018).",
              "The growth hypothesis underlines a causal link from energy to growth.",
              "Thus, efforts to decrease energy consumption will hamper economic growth (Yildirim et al.",
              ", 2012).",
              "The feedback hypothesis indicates a mutualistic connection between energy and growth\u2014implying that the institutionalization of economic and energy policies targeted at reducing either energy, growth, or both may backfire in the face of economic prosperity and energy security (Ayres, 2001).",
              "The non-existence of consensus on the causal relationship between energy and growth indicates a gap in the literature that continuously requires further studies to confirm such findings.",
              "These mixed findings signal an ongoing debate that future studies are invited to participate.",
              "This study contributes to the ongoing debate by expanding the extant literature by analyzing the role of energy diversification in wealth creation in developing economies.",
              "The specific novel contribution that this study presents can be observed from three aspects: variables used, scope of the sample, and method employed.",
              "From the variable perspective, most studies argue that environmental degradation is driven by using non-renewable energy (NRE) for economic growth, but the implications of environmental damage cannot be ignored.",
              "This study contributes to the literature by not only focusing on the role of fossil fuels but also renewable energy.",
              "Another effort of this study is the inclusion of labor and capital into the analysis to create a multivariate system that analyzes the causal connection between energy consumption and economic growth.",
              "In this sense, our study proposes a panel bootstrap causality test to explore the linkage in emerging countries.",
              "Thus, from the sampled perspective, we utilize both renewables (RE) and fossil fuel utilization (NRE) in economic growth function.",
              "We assess the performance of both and establish the coherence of investing in renewables from 1990 to 2016 across 17 emerging countries including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Greece, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey.",

              "To the best of our knowledge, no study has used this set of countries.",

              "There are mainly two reasons for selecting emerging countries.",
              "First, emerging countries require high energy needs namely fossil fuels to boost economic development (Waheed et al.",
              ", 2019).",
              "Second, the main reason for the outgrowth in CO2 emissions during the twenty-first century was mainly attributed to a surge in CO2 emissions from developing countries (Crippa et al.",
              ", 2020).",
              "Thus, emerging countries may tend to renewable energy sources to induce economic growth.",
              "From a methodological perspective, contrary to existing studies that utilize Granger causality technique, we apply a bootstrap panel causality methodology with a Fourier function.",
              "The novel effort of this study is to handle an econometric model that is superior to its counterparts in the available literature.",
              "In this way, structural breaks, cross-section dependence, and cross-country heterogeneity can be controlled.",
              "Incorporating structural breaks into the analysis reveals mixed results across the sample of emerging countries.",
              "First, most sample countries have no significant causal relationship between energy utilization and economic growth, even after structural breaks are controlled.",
              "This finding suggests the dominance of the neutrality hypothesis, which indicates that energy utilization and economic growth are mutually independent.",
              "Second, in terms of causal relationship between GDP and RE, the study found that six emerging economies, namely, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, and Thailand demonstrate a significant causal relationship from GDP to RE consumption\u2014which supports the conservation hypothesis.",
              "Contrary, Greece, Korea, and Turkey are in support of the growth hypothesis where a significant causal relationship is found from RE to GDP.",
              "In terms of the relationship between NRE and GDP by controlling for structural breaks, only Brazil exhibits unidirectional causality from NRE to GDP.",
              "A causal relationship running from GDP to NRE is confirmed in Korea, Pakistan, and the Philippines.",
              "Besides, South Africa is the only country where the two causality-links are present.",
              "Overall, the findings from this study are in support of past literature such as Ozturk and Acaravci (2011);",
              "Destek and Aslan (2017), which found unidirectional causal links in MENA countries.",

              "Their findings offer significant unidirectional and bi-directional causality between energy utilization and economic growth in Brazil and India.",
              "We deduce that the current study contributes to the literature and provides a significant heterogeneity across emerging countries and demonstrates the role of considering a structural break in the causal relationship between energy and economic growth.",
              "This study is organized as follows: literature review, description of data underlying the analysis and methodology, detail empirical results, and highlights from the study with policy implications.",
              "Efforts to achieve stable growth and preserve environmental quality are fast transforming into a hot topic across the globe among governments, academics, international institutions, and various stakeholders involved.",
              "Despite the extensive literature on the EC-economic growth link since the influential study of Kraft and Kraft (1978), there has been no consensus among scholars about the direction of causality (Ozcan and Ozturk, 2019).",
              "Scholars have also extensively examined the link between aggregate NRE/RE and economic growth.",

              "In urban areas over 50% of trips are typically under 10-kilometers, distances that are easily walked or cycled.",
              "Yet cities and countries often overlook the critical role of walking and cycling in the transport system and the numerous benefits this can bring their communities, meaning walking and cycling gets left out of transport budgets and infrastructure projects.",
              "First, high rates of active mobility lead to greater connectivity, reduced traffic and parking congestion, more reliable travel times and increased public transit ridership.",
              "Cities in Southeast Asia lose 2 to 5% of their annual GDP to congestion, with Manila in the Philippines suffering the worst loss at $67 million per day.",

              "Second, active travel can help reduce emissions to achieve global targets.",
              "Cities contribute 70% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and 21% of these come from urban transport alone.",
              "Shifting to walking and cycling can drastically reduce emissions and is the quickest and most efficient way to decarbonize transport.",
              "Third, positive effects on public health are also abundant with safe walking and cycling infrastructure.",
              "For example, the World Health Organization found that scaling up sustainable mobility in Accra, Ghana, could save up to 5,500 premature deaths with improvements to air quality and an additional 33,000 lives from increased physical activity over a 35-year period \u2014 and a saving of $15 billion in health care costs.",
              "Fourth, cities and towns have witnessed boosts to their economy upon improving pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, such as increased sales, commercial rent and job creation.",
              "One case study estimated that 11 to 14 jobs are created per $1 million invested in cycling and walking projects compared to the seven jobs created when investing in highways.",
              "Finally, traveling by foot or bike even improves equity, social cohesion, perceptions of security and liveability.",
              "After Istanbul, Turkey, pedestrianized its peninsula, a survey revealed that 68% of pedestrian respondents felt more comfortable in the area.",
              "Many low-income populations also live with little transport access or unsafe and inconvenient routes to their destinations.",
              "Constructing safe active travel networks can improve access to opportunities and services for these disadvantaged groups.",
              "Ultimately, people\u2019s physical, mental, social and economic health benefit from the ability to walk or bike in safe environments.",
              "Finding the funds to support active mobility infrastructure is often a major obstacle for communities \u2014 despite walking and cycling infrastructure being the most cost-effective way to benefit the most residents and to improve transportation systems. Methods for investing in walking and cycling vary widely, but there are some key ways funding can be achieved at the local, national, international and even private sector levels: The most common way local governments fund their active mobility projects is through general municipal funds, public works budgets or capital improvement programs. Towns and cities can also merge projects across departments to reduce costs and unlock further funds \u2014 such as installing bike lanes during pavement resurfacing.",
              "A more advanced step that local governments can take is to develop active mobility strategies (sometimes termed non-motorized transport strategies), especially those that include dedicated funds or funding sources.",
              "In 2014 the city of Fortaleza, Brazil, adopted a strategic cycling infrastructure plan, totalling 524-kilometers.",
              "To fund the network, the city tapped into revenue from an online and app-based parking system.",
              "Annual bike counts conducted by the city have seen a 153% increase in the number of cyclists from 2012 to 2017 and the cycle network has grown 350% since 2013.",
              "To overcome limited resources and tight budgets, local governments have also become creative and found other ways to source the needed funds.",
              "These sources can range from congestion charging to creating Business Improvement Districts to requiring developers to include sidewalks and bike lanes in their designs.",
              "As well as the ideas suggested here, the following policy recommendations provide some direction for sustainable financing: At the national level, creating active mobility policies and plans is also the most effective way to ensure funds go toward walking and cycling infrastructure and are sustained over time.",
              "Ireland, for example, has developed a comprehensive active travel investment program set to receive 20% of the annual transport budget.",
              "At \u20ac360 million per year, the country is investing \u20ac1 million a day in active mobility, a huge increase from the previous \u20ac12.",
              "64 million (less than 2% of the annual budget.)",
              "Notably, Ireland has also chosen to split the funds equally between walking and cycling, highlighting the need for walking and pedestrian infrastructure to be given greater weight.",
              "Historically, nationally designated funds for active mobility have been lacking, but as the climate crisis looms and the COVID-19 pandemic persists, the importance of active mobility is increasingly being recognized.",
              "The funding that does exist is largely clustered in high-income countries located in Europe and North America, reflecting a distinct need for national governments elsewhere around the globe to prioritize active mobility in their budgets.",
              "For LMICs, a critical first step is to integrate walking and cycling into existing national transport plans or standards.",
              "Multilateral development banks (MDBs) have supported nations and cities across all regions of the world with policymaking and infrastructure development.",
              "Multilateral finance has an important role to play in advancing active mobility in LMICs given the considerable financial and institutional challenges these countries often face.",
              "MDBs and international climate funds especially have the potential to address safety deficits in the global road network.",
              "Currently, over 85% of roads do not meet minimum walking and cycling safety requirements.",
              "Although most multilateral projects related to walking and cycling are to provide technical assistance, there are a few examples of active mobility infrastructure projects.",
              "In 2009, the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility financed sustainable mobility projects in four Argentine cities.",
              "The investments financed 18-kilometers of bikeways, a public bike-sharing system and capacity building projects, as well as other public transport and urban planning activities.",
              "Although the reach of the project was modest, the replication potential is significant and could serve as an example of how climate funding can produce infrastructure that improves conditions for people who walk and cycle.",
              "In addition to public and international funding, many private sources invest in active mobility infrastructure or programs. Public-private partnerships can be particularly powerful for financing active mobility and have been used to introduce bikeshare systems in several large cities, such as London, Mexico City, New York and Paris.",
              "Other private institutions may find that their missions are mirrored in the benefits brought by active mobility.",
              "Hospitals and health care systems, for example, have been known to contribute to physical infrastructure projects, especially those that provide access to their network for employees, visitors and patients alike.",
              "Universities and colleges are also keen to improve accessibility for their students, faculty and staff through cycling networks.",
              "In 2020, an assessment by Decisio and the Dutch Cycling Embassy for Pontificia Universidad Cato\u0301lica del Peru\u0301 in Lima found that it would cost the university six times less to provide its employees with cycling facilities than to provide on-campus parking.",
              "Active mobility has yet to become an institutional priority at the local, national or international level, where decisions about resources and financing opportunities are made.",
              "The COVID-19 pandemic has seen massive global increases in people walking and cycling as they social distance and seek ways to move around their communities safely.",
              "Interventions, like pop-up bike lanes and pedestrianized streets, have grown during the pandemic and will play an important role in economic recovery as public transportation ridership remains low.",
              "Cities around the world should be careful not to lose this momentum for active travel by investing in walking and cycling infrastructure through various green economic recovery plans.",

              "Here are a few examples: While the above examples highlight efforts by a few states and cities that are expanding transportation options while limiting investments in highway expansion, realizing the GHG reduction potential of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law means low-carbon investments like these need to become the norm rather than exceptions.",

              "Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a planning and design strategy that consists in promoting urban development that is compact, mixed-use, pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly, and closely integrated with mass transit by clustering jobs, housing, services, and amenities around public transport stations.",
              "Based on the premise that economic growth, urban transport, and land use can be managed more efficiently if planned together, TOD has been successfully applied at a city scale in cities around the world including Stockholm, Copenhagen, Hong Kong SAR, Tokyo, and Singapore.",
              "The benefits of Transit-Oriented Development A new report by the World Bank proposes the 3V Framework for TOD, which allows decision makers to better understand the linkages between connectivity, accessibility, place quality, and market potential values around a given station.",
              "Cities can then identify the type of development for which they are best-suited.",
              "The 3V Framework is applicable to large cities with extensive networks, and also smaller cities with only a few mass transit lines or a bus rapid transit system.",
              "Where, when, and how to implement TOD: the 3V Framework TOD principles cannot be applied uniformly across an entire city or transit network, since densities of jobs and people vary widely across the urban space.",
              "In fact, experience has shown that only about 15% of transit stations and their surrounding area can support very high density development.",
              "To make informed decisions about TOD, research institutions and governments have developed a variety of methodologies that can help identify which station areas are good candidates for TOD, determine what level of density the area around a given station can absorb, and figure out what kind of development mix makes sense in a particular area, looking to strike the right balance between jobs, housing, and other amenities.",
              "Building on these approaches, the report proposes a new framework for guiding TOD plans, by simultaneously assessing the \u201cthree values\u201d (3V) of transit stations and surrounding areas: The report presents an approach to identify and address potential imbalances between node, place and market potential values to create new economic opportunities\u2014for example, by improving the urban environment around a major transit hub, or by improving public transit service to a booming area.",

              "But policymakers have often pursued land use that has instead encouraged car-dependent housing in sprawling suburbs while underinvesting in transit and other forms of low-carbon transportation like biking and walking.",
              "This leads to higher transportation cost burdens for many low-income families.",
              "More equitable land use can be a step toward righting the wrongs of past policies\u2014such as redlining\u2014that harmed disadvantaged communities.",
              "To move away from heavy reliance on cars for transportation, policymakers need to enact land use policies to support a built environment that accommodates dense and affordable urban neighborhoods.",
              "Personal vehicles are the country\u2019s largest source of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions.",
              "Unfortunately, car-centric zoning codes often incentivize\u2014and sometimes only allow\u2014detached single-family homes, which means that communities are more spread out and cannot support transit, bicycling, or walking.",
              "To produce compact, mixed-use development, local governments can adopt smart growth strategies, including zoning that promotes transit and density, anti-sprawl policies, and codes that emphasize buildings that are compatible with their surroundings rather than codes that narrowly focus on how buildings are used.",
              "Conventional zoning codes organize communities and urban spaces by their uses;",
              "for example, a typical zoning code may only allow residential buildings (and prohibit commercial uses) in some areas.",
              "Instead, form-based codes allow for multiple uses to be near each other provided they are of appropriate scale, making it more likely residents are closer to their destinations.",
              "Zoning rules can also allow modifications from the standard zoning code in specific cases, like adding transit- and density-related requirements, which can reduce trips by car.",
              "Some cities have begun to rethink their central business districts, as these areas, previously zoned almost exclusively for commercial uses, have not fully recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to remote work for many office workers.",
              "This makes central business districts good candidates for additional housing.",
              "Cities can encourage the of some commercial buildings to housing through zoning codes.",
              "This would allow residents to live in job-, transit-, and amenity-rich areas and decrease reliance on personal vehicles.",
              "Local governments can encourage denser development with other smart growth strategies, particularly policies that limit urban sprawl.",
              "Portland, Oregon, for example, instituted growth containment boundaries, which encourage density by setting limits for how far urban areas can expand, limiting sprawl.",
              "Policies like building moratoria that control the number of building permits issued in suburban areas can limit sprawl and promote density in urban areas, encouraging commuters to switch from personal vehicles to transit.",
              "Governments in urban areas can also lower or remove minimum parking requirements.",
              "Requiring buildings to have a minimum number of parking spaces can increase costs and encourage people to drive more.",
              "Eliminating parking requirements also creates more space in cities for new housing and amenities, and for street designs that make it easier for residents to use low-carbon forms of transportation, such as bike lanes.",
              "Newer buildings often lack units with three or more bedrooms, which contributes to sprawl as families move to the suburbs in search of housing that accommodates their needs.",
              "Land use and zoning regulations can encourage additional bedrooms through density or height bonuses or require some developments to include larger units to avoid pushing families out of cities.",
              "Historically, federal, state, and local governments have weaponized zoning codes against disadvantaged communities, leading to inequitable outcomes.",
              "Residents may be skeptical of additional land use changes, so local governments should engage community-based organizations and disadvantaged community residents, encouraging them to take an active role in neighborhood land use and transportation planning and ensuring their needs are met.",
              "Engaging with these communities can limit unintended consequences such as gentrification and housing displacement when investment and development increases in neighborhoods.",
              "Beyond community engagement, local governments can also act directly to prevent displacement and gentrification.",
              "Washington, DC, for instance, bought low-cost land and preserved it for affordable housing development.",
              "Local governments can also require developers to allocate a certain percentage of new or rehabilitated units to low- and middle-income households.",
              "However, policymakers should note that this approach is most successful when coordinated with other local governments in the surrounding metropolitan area because the effectiveness of these policies can depend on regional housing market conditions.",
              "Many cities and localities have robust climate goals that will require substantial reductions in transportation emissions.",
              "Expanded transit and micro-mobility, more efficient land use, and reduced reliance on automobiles are practical tools to meet those goals.",
              "Cities should center equity in their planning and work with disadvantaged communities to create better places to live and work for all residents.",
