    "response": "That's a very important and complex question. According to the sources I found, climate change has already impacted our food production and supply in various ways, and it is expected to pose more challenges and risks in the future.\n\nSome of the impacts of climate change on food production and supply include:\n\n- Reduced crop yields due to higher temperatures, extreme weather events, droughts, pests, diseases, and soil erosion[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^] [^5^].\n- Increased food prices and volatility due to lower supply, higher demand, trade barriers, and speculation[^2^] [^5^].\n- Decreased food quality and safety due to higher carbon dioxide levels, water scarcity, contamination, and spoilage[^1^] [^4^] [^5^].\n- Increased food insecurity and malnutrition due to reduced availability, affordability, accessibility, and diversity of food[^1^] [^2^] [^4^] [^5^].\n\nSome of the measures that are being taken or proposed to ensure food security for future generations include:\n\n- Improving agricultural practices and technologies to increase efficiency, resilience, adaptation, and mitigation of climate change impacts[^1^] [^2^] [^4^] [^5^].\n- Enhancing food systems governance and coordination to promote fair trade, reduce waste, improve distribution, and support smallholders and vulnerable groups[^1^] [^2^] [^4^] [^5^].\n- Investing in research and innovation to develop new crops, varieties, methods, and solutions for climate-smart agriculture[^1^] [^2^] [^4^] [^5^].\n- Raising awareness and empowering consumers to make informed choices, reduce consumption, and adopt healthy and sustainable diets[^1^] [^2^] [^4^].\n\nI hope this helps you understand some of the main aspects of this topic.

              "Get NASA's Climate Change News: Subscribe to the Newsletter \u00bb Then the research team used the climate model simulations as inputs for 12 state-of-the-art global crop models that are part of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), an international partnership coordinated by Columbia University.",

              "Soybean and rice projections showed a decline in some regions but at the global scale the different models still disagree on the overall impacts from climate change.",
              "For maize and wheat, the climate effect was much clearer, with most of the model results pointing in the same direction.",
              "Maize, or corn, is grown all over the world, and large quantities are produced in countries nearer the equator.",
              "North and Central America, West Africa, Central Asia, Brazil, and China will potentially see their maize yields decline in the coming years and beyond as average temperatures rise across these breadbasket regions, putting more stress on the plants.",
              "Wheat, which grows best in temperate climates, may see a broader area where it can be grown as temperatures rise, including the Northern United States and Canada, North China Plains, Central Asia, Southern Australia, and East Africa, but these gains may level off mid-century.",
              "Temperature is not the only factor the models consider when simulating future crop yields.",
              "Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have a positive effect on photosynthesis and water retention, increasing crop yields, though often at a cost to nutrition.",
              "This effect happens more so for wheat than maize, which is more accurately captured in the current generation of models.",
              "Rising global temperatures also are linked with changes in rainfall patterns, and the frequency and duration of heat waves and droughts, which can affect crop health and productivity.",
              "Higher temperatures also affect the length of growing seasons and accelerate crop maturity.",

              "Commentary March 3, 2011 Global Economy and Development Food prices have risen to record highs for the second time in three years.",
              "Some blame the hedge fund speculators who have funneled large amounts of money into futures contracts in food markets.",
              "They argue that market mechanisms are broken and need fixing.",
              "Others blame their governments (look at the riots in the streets of several developing countries) and find fault in the political systems, corruption and cronyism that have robbed them of the resources to afford higher food prices.",
              "Their solutions are political.",
              "Still others look to pervasive poverty and high income inequality as the reason why food price volatility is of such concern.",
              "They focus on the social aspects and solutions.",
              "This separation into markets, politics and social stability is actually a useful frame for understanding how food prices affect developing countries and what needs to be done at a policy level.",
              "The issues are of course interconnected but too often the discourse becomes confused as one thread leads to another and the logic gets tangled.",
              "As an initial point, it\u2019s worth stressing that the crux of the food price challenge is about price volatility, rather than high prices per se.",
              "It is the rapid and unpredictable changes in food prices that wreak havoc on markets, politics and social stability, rather than long-term structural trends in food prices that we can prepare for and adjust to.",
              "And it is also worth noting that volatility cuts both ways\u2014prices go up and down.",
              "The only reason food prices are going up so much this year is because they came down so fast after reaching 2008 peaks.",
              "Both rapid increases and rapid declines in food prices can create problems. Food price volatility starts with the characteristics of food markets.",
              "What makes food markets distinctive is that both supply and demand curves are highly inelastic, meaning neither responds much to price changes in the short run.",
              "The most basic economics dictates that small shocks in either supply or demand will therefore lead to large price changes.",
              "Today, we have many shocks: supply shocks in important food producing countries due to extreme weather (droughts in Russia and China, floods in Australia and South Africa) and due to the higher cost of inputs (fertilizer, pesticides and transport over long distances) linked to oil prices.",
              "Demand shocks have come from sudden policy decisions to increase biofuel content in gasoline, for example.",
              "The result is volatility in food prices.",
              "Because food prices are so inherently volatile, it is natural that speculators should enter futures markets in a big way.",
              "Speculators make money out of understanding and providing insurance against volatility.",
              "They do not create the volatility themselves, except under very strange conditions.",
              "Almost all serious studies have come to the same conclusion: the volatility inherent in the food marketplace causes speculation, not the other way around.",
              "So what can be done?",
              "First and foremost, break the link between food prices and oil prices.",
              "The current global food system worked well in a world of cheap, stable energy prices which allowed food to be grown in concentrated locations and transported over huge distances to meet demands.",
              "That system will continue to give us volatility as long as oil prices remain volatile.",
              "I would not bet on a return to cheap, stable oil prices in the near term, so the answer must be to change the food system to adapt to the new economics of energy.",
              "That probably means more localized and more diversified production and consumption, less use of fertilizer, and less wastage (20 percent of all food gets spoiled in storage and transport today).",
              "Ironically, the organic, slow-food, go-local cooperative movement may find that market forces are their new best friend.",
              "Second, invest more in agriculture.",
              "There seemed to be an international consensus that this was indeed important;",
              "and a U.",
              "S.",
              "-led international fund to promote investments in agriculture was launched last year (the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program), but faced with budget pressures few countries have made new pledges or lived up to their commitments.",
              "From a $20 billion headline goal, GAFSP is now struggling to find a few hundred million dollars to support its programs. Third, get small-holder yields up.",
              "African productivity is only half that of India, one-quarter that of China and one-fifth that of the United States.",
              "The technology to increase yields is well-known but requires investments;",
              "90 percent of Africa\u2019s agricultural land is rain-fed and subject to the vagaries of weather.",
              "Mechanized power to till the soil would do wonders to raise yields.",
              "Markets can only work if governments allow them to do so.",
              "In many countries, food markets are not allowed to operate freely precisely because they generate confusing price swings in the short term.",
              "Governments like to make sure that rural farmers get \u201cfair\u201d prices (usually meaning large public subsidies), while urban constituents get subsidized food to consume.",
              "The balance between these constituencies varies from country to country, but the large-scale presence of government intervention in food markets is common across the world.",
              "The trouble is that when food prices are volatile, government intervention becomes unpredictable in terms of its budgetary cost.",
              "When corrupt governments are faced with unaffordable food subsidies, political stability (what has been called the authoritarian bargain) is at risk.",
              "And some government interventions reinforce price swings.",
              "For example, food exporters like Russia have resorted to export restrictions when food prices rise, reducing supply on international markets.",
              "That drives up prices still further.",
              "Many government interventions are designed to shelter local markets against volatility in the global price of food, but in fact it is precisely these national interventions that are spurring global volatility.",
              "The various border protections against the global market in place around the world segregate the world food market into a number of much smaller national markets, the exact opposite of what is needed today.",
              "If these distortions didn\u2019t exist\u2014in other words, if there was truly a single global market for food, and an actual \u201cworld\u201d price of food\u2014the volatility of prices would be much lower than the volatility in each of the protected local markets for food that we currently have.",
              "The difficulty, of course, is that there is little incentive for any single country to liberalize its agricultural trade so long as the distortions of other countries\u2014and the volatility in global markets they encourage\u2014remain.",
              "And this brings us directly to the failure to complete the Doha Development Round of trade talks, which is now in its 10th year of negotiations and has been stuck largely because of the impasse on agriculture.",
              "The ongoing failure of the Doha Round shows that the political will to take collective action to reduce food price volatility is lacking;",
              "there is no trust that the market will deliver access to food better than a government.",
              "Politicians in developing countries care more about volatile food prices than those in developed countries because their citizens are more directly affected by the ups-and-downs of food prices.",
              "Just a few years ago, the main social issue in India was farmer suicides because of low agricultural prices.",
              "Today, it is the lack of affordability of food for the poor.",
              "In some sub-Saharan African countries, the poor might spend 70 percent of their income on food.",
              "If food prices double, these households literally become faced with the prospect of starvation.",
              "The solution: safety nets or social protection for the poor, to cushion the blow of rapid changes in food prices.",
              "There are some drawbacks;",
              "good safety nets require effective targeting.",
              "Who should be protected?",
              "Economists might suggest the children, especially the very young, as there is ample evidence that early child malnutrition results in long-term deterioration of brain development.",
              "That line of thinking points towards subsidized school meals, or conditional cash transfer programs (sometimes means-tested, sometimes with self-selection).",
              "But politically it is the unemployed youth in urban areas that are most likely to riot.",
              "Getting cheap food to them is administratively cumbersome (government ration shops are the most common way) and normally subject to huge corruption.",
              "As a practical matter, few countries in sub-Saharan Africa actually have national social protection frameworks, although the concept of the value of social protection is now formally recognized (the African Union endorsed a social policy framework for Africa in 2009).",
              "So building social safety nets in poor developing countries remains a worthy but long-term project.",
              "All this brings us back to where we started\u2014big swings in food prices are happening more regularly (maybe because of climate change and the link to oil) and proving to be highly destabilizing for development and poverty reduction.",
              "The solutions lie in three areas\u2014improving food markets and agricultural production, building political will to integrate food markets across countries, and developing social safety nets in poor countries.",
              "All are long-term projects that have been on-and-off for some years now.",
              "And because none of the challenges are being tackled with the urgency that is needed, we can expect more of the same in the years to come.",

              "Most global crop models attempt to estimate future agricultural productivity, commonly for major commodities (such as grains and oilseeds), using a select few important biophysical parameters that regulate plant growth and yield, including temperature, precipitation, sunlight, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and nutrient availability (fig 1).",

              "Furthermore, additional features that are important for projecting yield outcomes\u2014such as soil properties, irrigation, and crop rotation intensity\u2014can be scarce and unreliable, further reducing the precision of final outputs.",
              "31 A further problem worth mentioning is that future changes in biophysical variables are often considered as averages, neglecting the key dimension of short term volatility.",
              "Climate extremes that influence agriculture are generally predicted to increase in the coming decades, and a warmer world is generally associated with a more active hydrologic cycle, making croplands more susceptible to floods and droughts.",

              "The toxic effect on crops of elevated ozone levels, for example, is expected to be weaker under higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations because most food plants can decrease stomatal intake and still receive the same amount of CO2, thereby limiting simultaneous ozone uptake.",
              "In the other direction, herbivorous pest pressure induces flowering crops to invest in defence over reproduction, reducing flower size, density, and nectar content, while also producing deterrent compounds in leaves, pollen, and nectar that are distasteful to pollinators.",
              "These responses have the unintended effect of causing plants to be less attractive to pollinators overall, reducing successful pollination and fruit yield in excess of that which might be damaged by pests.",
              "33 Both these examples show that the combined effect of any suite of stressors might result in unpredictable outcomes, which greatly complicates the ability to accurately forecast their net effect on crop yields, diets, and nutrition in a world rapidly changing across many dimensions.",
              "In today\u2019s context, we cannot ignore our growing vulnerability to disruptions in food trade.",
              "Several trends converge to generate this vulnerability.",
              "34 First, we have seen increasing reliance on food trade to achieve nutritional sufficiency as countries focus more on producing high value crops and less on the ability to subsist on domestic production.",
              "Second, both agricultural and wild harvested fisheries production are expected to shift away from the tropics and towards the poles in a warming world.",
              "But human population growth will occur primarily in the tropics, further disconnecting people from the food they rely on.",
              "Third, more extreme weather events are likely to cause more frequent climate shocks, and we have seen that food trade markets often behave perversely, closing doors to exports to protect domestic food prices and thereby amplifying the effect of the climate shocks on food prices.",
              "This increased vulnerability has been tragically on display over the past three years, first with disruptions associated with the covid-19 pandemic and now in response to the Russian Federation\u2019s invasion of Ukraine that is causing grain, cooking oil, and fertilizer shortages and sending cereal and other food commodity prices to historic highs while throwing tens of millions of people in poor, import dependent countries into new risk of food insecurity.",
              "Though increases in food trade to date have been beneficial overall to increase the efficiency and resilience of the global food system to disruptions in any one location, recent events have revealed a continued and growing vulnerability inherent to our dependence on food trade in a highly interconnected world experiencing more biophysical and social volatility.",
              "What does all of this mean to policy makers?",
              "We must be very cautious in interpreting projections of food production or food security because they rely on models that omit many important biophysical changes and include other variables with profound, irreducible uncertainties.",
              "This is not a criticism of the models but a reflection of the limitations in our understanding of both the fundamental Earth system processes and their interactions.",
              "We should also be concerned that the combination of accelerating human caused environmental change and growing dependence on a volatile food trade system are creating large vulnerabilities for human food security, nutrition, and health.",
              "In this context, policies to reduce vulnerability become enormously important (box 1).",
              "Human beings are transforming Earth\u2019s biophysical conditions with worrisome consequences for global food security, nutrition, and health.",
              "Our most powerful tools to understand the scope of the challenge are models, which are often used to explain how selected dimensions of physical, biological, and human systems may interact to affect food security.",
              "But these models cannot capture the full complexity of the real world and should not be relied on in isolation to provide an accurate picture of the future.",
              "As we describe, many factors beyond the scope of current models\u2014omitted variables, inherent uncertainty, short term volatility, and non-linear interactions\u2014suggest a more complex and risky future than current model projections might indicate.",
              "Building policy around model output that might underestimate true human consequences could leave millions of people vulnerable to food and nutritional insecurity in the coming decades.",

              "A range of policies were proposed to help support efforts across the food system to cut the amount of food lost or wasted each year, and a surprisingly large number of these were actually enacted \u2013 especially on the state and local levels, where the most forward movement is occurring.",
              "To help make sense of the policy landscape, ReFED has updated and relaunched the Food Waste Policy Finder, an online resource developed and maintained in partnership with the Harvard Law School Food Law and Policy Clinic (FLPC), which allows users to explore legislative and regulatory policy at the federal, state, and local levels.",

              "\u201cNot all of the policies that were proposed were actually enacted, but the fact that food waste is part of the conversation is an important step forward.",

              "Because government agencies employ large portions of the population and generate a sizable amount of waste, adding waste reduction and diversion requirements to these agencies is an easy, highly impactful step that state governments can take to reduce the volume of landfilled organic waste.",
              "New York built on their 2019 Food Donation and Food Scraps Recycling Law with NY S 901 which requires that large groceries stores donate their \u201cexcess edible food\u201d to qualified \u201cfood relief organizations,\u201d such as religious or nonprofit organizations.",

              "Dis-adoption of climate-resilient crops and crop varieties was discussed in 12 of the 202 papers included in our evidence synthesis.",
              "The major reasons for dis-adoption included technology not meeting expectations due to poor performance or quality of the technology or variety (8 papers), government policies (3 papers), technical constraints (2 papers), labour shortages (1 paper) or financial constraints (1 paper).",
              "Eight of the twelve studies indicated that dis-adoption was specifically due to the performance of a crop variety, and four of these eight studies indicated that the varieties\u2019 performance under stress conditions did not meet farmers\u2019 expectations10,11,12,13.",
              "The primary goal of this scoping review was to identify factors in adoption of climate-resilient crops in climate-vulnerable countries.",

              "otherwise, they are considered only in combination with other crops.",

              "However, this is a concerning trend given that some legumes, roots and tuber crops (for example, cassava, bambara groundnuts and beans) that are largely neglected in the studies have known climate resilience, are sources of high-quality nutrition and provide more well-established environmental benefits than cereals, such as soil enrichment.",
              "About 50% of the studies included in this scoping review identified agricultural extension and awareness outreach as the most relevant factor for adoption of climate-resilient technologies in low- and middle-income countries.",
              "Agricultural extension links farmers with the latest research and engages in a translational practice to make complex information more accessible to farmers.",

              "Poor funding for extension services in the developing world have limited farmers\u2019 access to training and expert guidance on emerging technologies17.",
              "Partnerships with other emerging players in information exchange, such as telecommunications companies and non-governmental organizations, will be key.",
              "Farmers generally tend to be risk averse, which leads to limited investment and adoption of improved agricultural production technology18.",
              "Experienced farmers use precautionary strategies to protect against the possibility of catastrophic loss in the event of a climatic shock and thus optimize management for average or likely conditions, but not for unfavourable conditions.",
              "These ex ante, precautionary strategies include selection of crops and cultivars and improved production technology18.",
              "In general, there is widespread agreement that aside from the useful experience that farmers gain from the time they have spent in farming, their experience with climatic shocks is key to their adoption of climate-resilient technologies.",
              "Many studies showed that farming experience is influential in adoption and utilization, and previous experiences with environmental shocks such as drought can influence adoption of climate-resilient crops and crop varieties.",
              "The more experience farmers have with climatic shocks, the more likely they are to be receptive to the adoption of related climate-resilient technologies.",
              "For example, experience with drought shock in the agro-ecological zone of Brong Ahafo, Ghana, increased the probability of adoption of drought-tolerant varieties by 15%, and farmers reported that drought shock was the primary reason for adoption of drought-tolerant varieties19.",
              "It has been widely acknowledged that education levels of farmers have a positive correlation with technology adoption, and our synthesis demonstrates that this is also relevant for the adoption of climate-resilient crops16,20,21,22.",

              "A study based in Zimbabwe showed a 52% decrease in production of traditional sorghum varieties in favour of new varieties better suited to drier conditions for every additional year of schooling, and a 5% increase in growing new early-maturing varieties23.",
              "Changing crop varieties is one of the most frequently cited climate-resiliency strategies for both men and women farmers, but women are more likely to adopt such strategies when they are aware of climate-adaptation options24.",
              "Other intersectional variables such as marital status, education and age, in combination with gender, influenced whether improved seed was grown by households25.",
              "A major shortcoming of the reviewed literature is that most studies included women only when they were household heads.",
              "Definitions of household headship are variable, and when women are only included as household heads, their views do not necessarily represent the views of women who live in male-headed households26.",
              "A large majority of women live in male-headed households, and their views are rendered invisible through this practice27.",
              "For example, young, poor women who were household heads were the least likely to adopt drought-tolerant maize in Uganda, whereas spouses of male household heads influenced adoption decisions on their husbands\u2019 fields9.",
              "Only a few studies paid attention to intra-household dynamics, gender roles and relations, and how these shape adaptation decisions9,28.",
              "This limited attention on intra-household gender dynamics and decision making around climate-resilient seed adoption skews the conclusions and recommendations, as the literature does not equally represent the challenges and views of women.",
              "Seed policies in many countries focus on strengthening formal, national seed systems that rely on variety-release mechanisms, seed certification policies and seed companies for distribution.",
              "These types of seed systems remain difficult to access for many farmers, and evidence from the papers in this scoping review suggests that strengthening local seed systems is essential.",
              "Local seed systems rely on social networks to ensure multiple options to access seed of a range of climate-resilient crops and varieties, including local landraces and improved seed.",
              "Thus, context specificity is important for seed systems, as it is for almost all factors influencing adoption of climate-resilient crops and varieties.",
              "The determinants of adoption that we identified are, in many cases, context-specific and therefore implementation of specific interventions is most successful when they are tailored to their environment and the cropping system.",
              "Seemingly contradictory or opposing (positive and negative) effects of each determinant of adoption were commonly reported among\u2014and sometimes within\u2014studies.",
              "Sex, age, education, years of farming experience and indicators of socio-economic status or wealth (assets) all affected decisions to adopt climate-resilient technologies in context-specific and sometimes opposite ways, depending on interacting environmental, policy and household factors.",
              "For example, equal and sizable numbers of studies (13 each) identify positive and negative effects of age on adoption.",
              "Whereas some studies identified older farmers to be more reluctant to adopt new technologies, other studies found that the earned experience, broad social networks and accumulation of wealth associated with older farmers may explain a positive effect on adoption.",
              "Extension and access to information about climate-resilient technologies and weather might be exceptions to this trend, as these determinants seem to transcend context-specific implementation.",
              "The resulting conclusion is that there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 recommendation to ensure adoption of climate-resilient crops and crop varieties, and interventions are unlikely to uniformly benefit all climate-vulnerable farmers (Table 3).",
              "This is consistent with the large number of papers in this study that reported farmers adopting climate-resilient crops as part of broader climate-resilient strategies.",
              "Climate resiliency at farm level is essential to achieve food security and improve livelihoods of rural communities, especially in countries and communities that depend on local agricultural production to ensure household income and achieve daily adequate caloric intake and balanced nutrition.",
              "Understanding the factors contributing to adoption and dis-adoption of climate-resilient crops provides opportunities to increase adoption and reduce the impact of climate change on rural communities in developing countries.",
              "The most important determinants of adoption of climate-resilient crops based on our analysis are the availability and effectiveness of extension services and outreach, followed by education levels of heads of households, farmers\u2019 access to inputs, especially seeds and fertilizers, and socio-economic status of farming families.",
              "Building resilience to climate change requires a cropping-systems, and more often a farming-systems approach.",
              "The results from this scoping review show that the adoption of climate-resilient crops and varieties, in most cases, happens as part of whole-farm and climate-smart agriculture strategies to cope with changing climate.",

              "This can be achieved by empowering existing social networks, such as farmer organizations.",
              "There is no single profile that applies to all farmers.",
              "Therefore, extension services will need to continue to evolve to be (1) participatory, (2) information and communications technology enhanced, and (3) partnerships based.",

              "Conclusions: This study provided a demonstration that an assessment based on a multidimensional and multilevel approach is helpful to identify knowledge gaps and to profile critical segments to put in place targeted policy interventions.",
              "Nutrition policy relied on consumer knowledge since the information of the public through education and dietary guidelines influences the behavior of people to make better choices (1).",
              "Among determinants of food choices of individuals, nutrition knowledge (NK) is considered as one of the factors affecting food intake (2).",
              "To investigate the impact of the NK effect, the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (GNKQ) was developed and validated by Parmenter and Wardle (3) and widely used in several groups of population and different settings (2, 4, 5).",
              "Written questionnaires were frequently used to measure NK.",
              "The correctness of the responses relies on participant literacy, a relevant factor to be considered when target groups have low levels of education and socioeconomic status (6).",
              "According to Spronk et al.",
              "(7), methodologies and information collected through NK varied widely, with some assessments measuring general concepts and others focusing only on some specific nutrients such as fat or fiber.",
              "As the importance of assessing NK in nutrition education programs is recognized, it appears essential to use questionnaires that accurately evaluate the constructs intended to be measured, in particular, when the objective of the measurements is the relation between NK and diet quality (8).",
              "The individual cognitive process of nutrition information is influenced by the differences between objective knowledge (i.",
              "e., consolidated information acquired from qualified sources without personal interpretation) and subjective knowledge that occurs when people do not accurately perceive their level of competency (9).",
              "Several studies investigated the impact of knowledge on food choice and consumption habits, showing that subjective knowledge is a stronger driver of consumer behavior than objective knowledge (10\u201315).",
              "As one of the factors influencing food choices, NK positively impacts the adoption of healthy eating habits (8).",
              "According to Wardle et al.",
              "(16), the highest knowledge corresponds to the highest adherence to nutritional recommendations, at least for selected foods such as fruit, vegetables, and fat.",
              "However, the growing exposure to web information and biased self-perception of NK contribute to increasing false beliefs (9).",
              "According to Alba and Hutchinson (17), consumers are overconfident, meaning that they are convinced to know more than they do.",
              "According to Miller et al.",
              "(18), individuals will change their diets appropriately when they get accurate information about what they should eat and they should know the effects of foods consumption on health.",
              "Several studies addressed knowledge effects on dietary intake and the broad range of consumer attributes and behaviors related to foods such as attitudes, perceptions, and choices (7).",
              "The mechanism by which NK affected dietary behaviors is complex and non-univocal.",
              "Food choices and nutritional intake are determined by the awareness of individuals about food and by the self-perception of the importance of balanced meals.",
              "Nutritional awareness has a direct effect on diet quality and is related to socioeconomic factors, in particular, education and income that influence the nutritional awareness-diet quality relationship (19).",
              "It is assumed that NK will lead to an improvement of the diet by providing individuals the necessary information about choosing healthy foods, preparing and consuming these foods as recommended in dietary guidelines (20), and on the health consequences of eating unhealthy foods (5, 21).",
              "GNKQ was developed for adults (3) and the evaluation of NK was frequently carried out in different settings, such as hospitals (20) and schools (22).",
              "NK assessment in schools could be related with nutrition literacy assessments on teachers (4) and on parents to evaluate their influence on children behaviors (23, 24) also in consideration of the socioeconomic and working status of parents (25).",
              "Moreover, schools could be used simply as recruitment recipients of adults as a sample of the general population.",
              "In Italy, NK assessment was carried out in a limited number of studies, despite the documented gap between nutritional recommendations (26, 27), food consumption pattern (28), and nutritional status of the population (29\u201331).",
              "As shown in a study carried out by Mazzocchi et al.",
              "(32), Italian consumers claimed for nutrition education, in particular, school education (88%), public information campaigns (81%), and nutrition information on meals provided by canteens (64%);",
              "in addition to that, 56% of the interviewed considered that the lack of knowledge on nutrition is a determinant of overweight and obesity.",
              "In the light of this scenario, we believe that NK assessment can play an important role in understanding the nutrition information needs and awareness in population groups, hypothesizing the existence of a relationship between NK and adherence to dietary recommendations.",
              "The purpose of this study is to measure the NK level in a sample of parents and to show the process of development and use of an innovative approach that combines the objective and subjective nutrition knowledge (S-NK) and dietetic profiles.",

              "As mentioned, we used a very similar NK questionnaire validated in Italy by Bonaccio et al.",
              "(34).",
              "The percentage of correct answers of present NK assessment was 46% higher than those measured by Bonaccio et al.",

              "2 of 92).",
              "The discrepancy could be explained considering several factors: the different socioeconomic contexts (central region vs. south region), the period of the survey (2017 vs. 2009), and the higher education level in our sample.",
              "In this study, NK scores resulted strictly related to the degree of urbanization, age, education, and working status.",
              "In particular, the sample represented the structural duality between rural and urban areas, as intended in the study design.",
              "The association between NK and education and age was confirmed in other studies (34, 37, 43, 44), most of them cross-sectional, with a convenience sample of adults and in some cases including specific population groups such as athletes.",
              "The relationship between NK and education level should be taken into consideration in designing information plans.",
              "The analysis of answers to the NK questionnaire showed that in the assessed sample, recommendations of experts were better known than food composition and diet\u2013disease relationship.",
              "Several recommendations reported in the current (19) and past Italian FBDG (45) are still not known such as brown sugar being \u201chealthier\u201d than white sugar.",
              "Another element of non-knowledge emerging in this study is related to the basic nutritional aspects related to fats, especially in terms of caloric contents and composition of fat-source foods.",
              "The assessment of NK showed a clear difference among consolidated long-term recommendations concerning the most recent correlations of dietetic risk factors and non-communicable diseases.",
              "In our sample, the relationships between diet and cardiovascular diseases were better known than those between nutrition and cancer.",
              "It is important to point out that alcohol was recognized as a risk factor for cancer only by one-third of respondents.",
              "This could be because the public health recommendation on alcohol consumption has changed recently (46), and the avoidance of alcohol consumption to prevent cancer was not yet known by the respondents of this study, and probably not yet widespread.",
              "The impact of NK on dietary intake received limited research attention despite the relevance of this investigation (7).",
              "Specifically, most studies, cross-sectional and with a convenience sample, reported a significant and positive association between NK and some aspects of dietary intake, with few studies reporting negative associations, and approximately one-third failed to observe any association (7, 37).",
              "We confirmed an association between dietetic profile and NK scores.",
              "In our sample, a significant proportion of individuals with nutritional habits highly adherent to recommendations had also a high NK score;",
              "the relation is biunivocal with subjects having unhealthy nutrition habits showing low NK scores.",
              "Looking at the diagonal of the NK-AIDGI map, a proportion of 40% of respondents were classified as having high NK and high adherence to recommendations.",
              "As to the segments classified outside the diagonal, the reasons for the \u201cinconsistency\u201d could be related to the complexity of food choice determinants that include physiological components, cultural and social pressures, and personality characteristics (47).",
              "In the same way, high adherence to recommendations associated with low NK could be related to consolidated healthy eating habits derived from cultural and familiar heritage, even in the presence of scarce nutrition literacy.",
              "Further research needs to be carried out to better understand the causal relationship between food choice determinants and NK.",
              "However, consistently with the aims of this study, both the maps showed critical segments revealing vulnerable groups.",
              "The overconfident segment (low objective NK and high S-NK, 19% of the sample) and the segment including subjects with a low level of knowledge and eating habits (12%) presented common socioeconomic characteristics: young age, living in rural areas, unemployed, and economically inactive, with low education level.",
              "Interestingly, the urban context showed higher NK scores and education and lower objective/S-NK divide concerning the rural context.",
              "These findings reflect the fact that rural areas would require stronger and focused efforts in terms of educational intervention.",
              "If these data will be confirmed in a larger study, education interventions should take into account these societal aspects.",
              "In this sample, people that know more about nutrition tend to eat better and consequently to have normal weight, as demonstrated by the relationship between NK and ponderal status.",
              "A concept that seems obvious but not so linear and not always confirmed in other studies.",
              "A review performed by Barbosa and coworkers (44) found that high scores of NK may influence the adoption of healthy food habits, but not always do these scores show an association with body weight.",
              "In the same way, Kliemann et al.",
              "(37) could not find a relationship between NK and ponderal status in a study carried out in the United Kingdom.",
              "Instead, the other mentioned Italian study (34) proved that the highest scores of NK are associated with adherence to Mediterranean dietary patterns and a lower prevalence of obesity.",
              "In the light of mentioned novelties, this study has limitations.",
              "The opportunistic sampling would not permit a generalization and extrapolations at a broad level should be made cautiously.",
              "Another limitation is related to the dietary assessment based on a food frequency questionnaire that does not provide an accurate food consumption measurement.",
              "However, the objective of this study was not a consumption evaluation to measure calories and nutrients;",
              "the inclusion of a food frequency section in NK assessment was aimed to describe food habits, providing a qualitative assessment of consumption patterns aimed to measure the adherence to dietary recommendations.",
              "For the first time and with a pioneering approach, we developed the AIDGI, an indicator based on a qualitative frequency scale that needs to be improved, even if it seems reasonably appropriate for the scope of the protocol.",
              "The innovative aspect and strength of this study are the two directions of the assessment allowing to build a multidimensional framework (from knowledge to behavior) as well as a multilevel framework from micro (i.",
              "e., knowledge about the role of specific food groups in nutrition or frequency of consumption of an individual food group) to macro information (global assessment of both NK and adherence to dietary guidelines).",
              "As such, it appears a helpful potential assessment approach for educational campaigns either as a benchmark as well as an evaluating instrument.",
              "This work contributed to the debate on the role of NK as a key element able to stimulate behavior changes toward healthier eating habits.",
              "NK as part of the most general health literacy represents an asset to be considered along with S-NK and eating habits to identify specific groups of the population.",
              "The results encourage future research.",
              "Performing a national study to refine the instrument developed in this explorative study as a support for planning educational interventions could be of high interest in the public health nutrition context.",
              "With this approach, nutrition education activities and programs would have the highest impact, reaching people that are more in need than usually are those less motivated to change.",
              "General consideration on the provision of recommendations and the source of nutrition information could be provided.",
              "This study showed that institutional bodies are not considered as the reference sources by the individuals involved in the survey.",
              "If confirmed by a larger analysis, it would represent a key aspect to be faced, also considering that specialized web communication resulted frequently consulted by respondents.",
              "The issue of web communication and, in general, the communication that uses means different from classical instruments, such as guidelines, leaflets, newspapers, or TV, needs to be addressed by educators and communicators either in nutrition or in other science sectors.",

              "6,7 Transitioning toward more sustainable diets will require fundamental changes in how the food system is organized, controlled, and regulated to ensure alignment with human and environmental health, to improve democratic accountability, to promote food citizenship, and to address existing power imbalances.",
              "4,8\u201310 Thus, multisectoral efforts and a combination of top-down policy interventions (eg, incentivizing more sustainable food production and consumption along with bottom-up community-based approaches9) will be essential to progress toward more-sustainable diets.",
              "A key focus of these approaches will likely be on encouraging and supporting consumer behaviors and attitudes more aligned with sustainable dietary practices.",
              "However, any efforts to shift consumption patterns will need to account for the influences underpinning dietary practices if \u201cpopulation-wide, long-lasting changes\u201d9(p825) are to be achieved, including sociocultural factors.",
              "1 The purpose of this scoping review is to synthesize the empirical evidence on consumers\u2019 attitudes and behaviors toward more-sustainable diets to assist the development of strategies encouraging behavior change and to contribute to understanding how support for structural and system-level changes can be generated at the societal level.",

              "The rationale for all articles was centered mostly on human and environmental health and only 30% of articles (n = 16) provided a definition of a sustainable diet that extended beyond a human and environmental health framing (see supplementary materials, data 1 [Table S1 in the Supporting Information online]).",
              "Furthermore, overrepresentation of women and well-educated and urban populations was observed in 22% of the included studies, but particularly in articles exploring sustainable diets more generally (30%).",
              "As illustrated in Figure 2, and presented in further detail in the supplementary materials (see Table S2 in the Supporting Information online), the factors influencing the uptake of more-sustainable diets operate at both the structural and intermediary levels.",

              "64 However, although women are more open to adopting meatless meals,42 and thus are a suggested target group for interventions and campaigns,33 qualitative research highlights that this interest can be hampered by less-willing male partners and children.",
              "26,34,44 On the other hand, there is also evidence of men reducing their meat consumption due to the influence of a vegetarian partner.",
              "26 The relationship between higher educational attainment and more-sustainable dietary practices has also been observed in several studies,19,40,48,51,52,59 and other additional studies suggest that the more educated a person is, the more likely they are to believe that current levels meat production and consumption are unsustainable30,65 and to purchase meat replacements.",
              "52 Links between place of residence and sustainable dietary practices, awareness, and openness to alternative consumption patterns have also been observed.",
              "For example, in Portugal, those living in urban areas are more knowledgeable about environmental implications associated with meat production, more familiar with meat alternatives, and more open to reducing meat consumption compared with those living in rural areas.",
              "55 Research carried out in Scotland suggests that personal links to the agricultural economy are associated with less familiarity with the concept of sustainable diets and a lower willingness to reduce meat consumption.",
              "42 In contrast, another Scotland-based study reported no location- or sex-based differences in resistance to reducing meat consumption.",
              "26 The variation in findings is likely attributed to the specific sociocultural and economic contexts in which these studies took place, in addition to differing research designs and questions.",
              "The social, cultural, economic, and informational environments in which people live can also support existing consumption patterns.",
              "Meat consumption is tied to various social values such as pleasure, identity, heritage, and cultural norms11,26,34,42,53,62 and, in many high-income countries, meat is perceived as central and necessary to ensure a \u201cproper dinner.",

              "For instance, in Norway,53 New Zealand,44 and the United Kingdom,57 the influence of the agricultural sector and institutional discourses on national narratives concerning sustainability was noted as at odds with a shift toward less meat consumption.",
              "In the case of Norway, this was offered as a partial explanation of why consumers underestimate the environmental impacts of meat consumption and was noted as a barrier to reducing current consumption levels.",
              "53 Kemper43 reported a lack of trust in both advice from the New Zealand government and the food supply chain more generally.",
              "In Scotland, qualitative findings highlight confusion and skepticism about the amounts of red and processed meat that can be consumed as part of healthy diet and scientific evidence on the health and environmental impacts of red and processed meat, because of perceived conflicts of interest and contradictory messages.",
              "34 These factors contribute to making an already-complex food environment, with multiple and often conflicting messaging, difficult for consumers to navigate.",
              "For example, 1 large-scale study (n = 22,934) identified how French consumers are \u201ctorn between purchasing animal-based products to follow [national] dietary guidelines or limit purchase for environmental issues\u201d31 and that these dilemmas were more prominent when purchasing meat rather than dairy foods.",
