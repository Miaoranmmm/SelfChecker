These clay tablets from ancient Mesopotamia contained instructions for preparing and administering various remedies for various ailments[^4^].\n- The earliest written record that mentions the practice of medicine is Hammurabi's Code from the 18th century BC.

              "Instead, the mature cataract was purposefully dislodged out of the visual axis with a needle.",
              "The cataract remained in the eye but was no longer blocking light, producing instantaneous improvement in vision.",
              "Indeed, in the very immediate postoperative period, couching was considered a success, but the retained cataractous lens and the lack of aseptic technique soon had deleterious effects on the eye, often resulting in blindness shortly after the procedure.",

              "5 Couching, the earliest known method of treating cataract.",
              "As knowledge of ocular anatomy and eye disease expanded, so did the approach to cataract surgery.",
              "While couching is generally thought to have been the predominant method of cataract treatment until the 18th century, ancient literature suggests that as early as 600 BC, an Indian surgeon, named Sushruta, may have been the first to perform some type of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE).",
              "6 The procedure is termed \u201cextracapsular\u201d because the lens capsule is left in place.",
              "The first true cataract extraction was performed in 1747, in Paris, by the French surgeon Jacques Daviel.",
              "His procedure was more effective than couching, with an overall success rate of 50%.",
              "7 Daviel\u2019s procedure basically involved making a large corneal incision (more than 10 mm), puncturing the lens capsule, expressing the nucleus, and then extracting the lens cortex by curettage.",
              "Although this procedure represented great progress compared to couching, postoperative complications were considerable, including poor wound healing, retained lens remnants, posterior capsular opacification, and infection.",
              "Despite the risks of Daviel\u2019s procedure, it remained the accepted approach for cataract extraction for over 100 years, until the 19th century, when intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) became, for a time, the preferred method of cataract removal.",
              "However, improvements in operative methods and surgical tools eventually led to the reemergence, in the 1970s, of ECCE as the preferred approach over ICCE, which fell out of favor because of high rates of blinding complications.",
              "Modern day versions of ECCE and manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) are now used in many parts of the world, including the United States.",
              "Techniques for performing extracapsular cataract removal have dramatically improved over time, to the point where the overall success rate is now 90% to 95%.",
              "8 In 1753, Samuel Sharp performed the first documented intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE).",
              "9 With ICCE, the entire lens, including the lens capsule, is removed through a large limbal incision.",
              "Samuel Sharp used his thumb to expel the cataract from the eye.",
              "Fracturing the zonular fibers that suspend the lens to the eye was a vital part of the ICCE procedure.",
              "The mechanism by which the zonules were broken has evolved from the early use of forceps to hold the lens capsule and manually disrupt the zonules.",
              "In 1957 Joaquin Barraquer was the first surgeon to utilize the enzyme alpha-chymotrypsin to dissolve the lens zonules.",
              "10 Cryoextraction also proved to be a successful method for ICCE.",
              "With cryoextraction, a frozen probe is applied to the cataract, which adheres to the probe, and the cataract is gently evacuated from the eye.",
              "The success of ICCE grew with the advent of modern anesthetic and sterilization techniques, but its popularity rapidly declined as improvements were made in ECCE techniques.",
              "The major drawbacks of ICCE are related to removing the lens and lens capsule in its entirety.",
              "The lens capsule serves as a wall between the anterior and posterior structures of the eye.",
              "Potentially blinding complications from ICCE, such as retinal detachment, macular edema, and corneal decompensation, are more likely to occur when this wall is not in place to prevent the vitreous from prolapsing forward.",
              "Furthermore, ICCE requires larger incisions to remove a cataract, leading to slow healing and a greater amount of surgically induced astigmatism.",
              "Despite the drawbacks of ICCE, it remained the primary approach for cataract extraction in the United States, well into the 1970s, and modern ICCE is still in practice in developing countries.",
              "As improvements in surgical techniques, anesthesia, and equipment evolved, ICCE fell out of favor and was supplanted by ECCE as the standard of care for cataract extraction.",
              "ECCE has proved to be an extremely effective method of cataract removal, with considerably better visual outcomes than with ICCE.",
              "The advent of an intraocular lens (IOL) to replace the cataractous lens has led to improved refractive results after surgery.",
              "The arrival in 1972 of ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs) improved the facility and safety of the operation as well.",
              "An OVD is a gel-like substance used during cataract surgery to maintain space in the eye, preventing deflation of the globe and protecting the structures inside the eye without interfering with the steps of the operation.",
              "In 1967, an American ophthalmologist, Charles Kelman, revolutionized cataract surgery when he introduced phacoemulsification (often referred to as \u201cphaco\u201d) as an alternative approach to ECCE.",
              "11 With conventional ECCE, the entire nucleus of the lens is removed from the eye through a large (10 mm) incision.",
              "In phacoemulsification, an ultrasound-driven needle emulsifies and aspirates the lens through a considerably smaller (3 to 4 mm) incision.",
              "Phacoemulsification was initially met with resistance, but this procedure is now considered the safest and the preferred method of cataract surgery in the developed world.",
              "The smaller incision results in a more stable anterior chamber throughout surgery, shorter recovery time, and less surgically induced astigmatism.",
              "The current phacoemulsification procedure is performed in the following manner.",
              "Pupillary dilation with topical medications usually takes place in the preoperative holding area.",
              "Topical anesthetic agents, introduced by Fischman in 1993,12 are commonly administered before the procedure.",
              "In the operating room, after sterile preparation of the eye with povidone-iodine and draping, the eye is adequately exposed using a lid speculum, the surgical microscope is positioned, and the surgery begins.",
              "A paracentesis, or sideport incision (1 mm), is made in the cornea.",
              "Through this small incision, OVD is injected into the anterior chamber to protect the ocular structures as well as stabilize the globe in preparation for the main incision.",
              "The main incision is then made, which can range from 1.",

              "This wound is constructed in a multiplanar fashion to promote self-sealing at the conclusion of the procedure (\u201cstitchless cataract surgery\u201d).",
              "Next, a continuous circular opening is made in the anterior lens capsule (capsulorrhexis) to gain exposure of the contents of the lens.",
              "The phacoemulsification handpiece is then introduced into the eye to emulsify and aspirate the lens.",
              "After removal of all of the lens contents, all but the anterior portion of the lens capsule is then removed during capsulorrhexis.",
              "The anterior portion of the lens capsule, or capsular bag, remains intact and will serve to house the IOL.",
              "All of the lens contents are moved by phaco thorugh an opening made in the lens capsule (capsulorrhexis).",
              "All that remains after phaco is the lens capsule (minus the anterior portion that was removed during capsulorrhexis).",
              "The remaining lens capsule, or capsular gag, will serve to house the IOL.",

              "Cataract surgery in developed parts of the world has evolved into a refractive procedure, in which expectations of spectacle independence are commonplace.",
              "In the hands of experienced phaco surgeons, the above-outlined steps of cataract surgery are extremely controlled and consistent, so that surgical outcomes are predictable with a good degree of reliability.",
              "However, in medicine, there is always room for improvement.",
              "In 2001, femtosecond laser technology was applied to LASIK refractive surgery to create the corneal flap, resulting in a more precise LASIK flap.",
              "This technology was utilized in cataract surgery for the first time, in 2008, when the first femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery was performed in Budapest, Hungary.",
              "13 The laser does not obviate the need for phacoemulsification.",
              "Instead, the laser performs many of the steps of the cataract procedure, including constructing the main wound, creating the capsulorrhexis, and fragmenting the lens.",
              "Limbal relaxing incisions to correct astigmatism are often also performed with the laser.",
              "With femtosecond laser technology, visual acuity outcomes are thought to be more precise, predictable, and reproducible compared to conventional cataract extraction.",
              "However, data do not demonstrate that femtosecond laser\u2013assisted cataract surgery yields outcomes superior to those of manual phacoemulsification surgery.",
              "Thus far, the two approaches appear to be equally safe and effective.",
              "14 Although many cataract surgeons worldwide have adopted femtosecond laser technology, there are still many phaco surgeons who do not believe this technology is beneficial or cost-effective.",
              "15 The incredible success of cataract surgery would not have been possible without the development of intraocular lenses (IOL).",
              "In 1949 Sir Harold Ridley, a British ophthalmologist, implanted the first IOL.",
              "Prior to the introduction of IOLs, patients were aphakic (without a lens) after cataract surgery.",
              "Postoperatively the aphakic patient required high-powered hyperopic spectacles to be able to refract light and focus images on the retina.",
              "This meant that a patient who was losing vision due to a cloudy lens would have cataract surgery, only to find that, without correction, vision remained poor due to the absence of the lens.",
              "A medical student working with Ridley was reported to have asked, Why not replace the cataractous lens with a clear lens?",
              "16 Sir Harold Ridley realized that wounded World War II pilots tolerated plastic pieces of shattered airplane windshields in their anterior chambers,17 and this observation encouraged him to implant an IOL made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), also known as acrylic glass.",
              "Initially Ridley\u2019s approach garnered little support, as there were considerable postoperative complications, including glaucoma, uveitis, and dislocation of implanted lens.",
              "Remarkable innovations in IOL technology and design have occurred since Ridley\u2019s groundbreaking work.",
              "The goal of IOL implantation is to achieve the best refractive outcome while avoiding complications.",
              "IOLs can be implanted in various sites, including in the anterior chamber, tied to the iris, in the ciliary sulcus (the space between the anterior lens capsule and iris), and in the capsular bag.",
              "When IOL implantation was introduced, ICCE was the predominant method of cataract extraction, with removal of the entire lens, including the lens capsule, necessitating placement of the IOL in the anterior chamber or fixed to the iris.",
              "Early lens designs were not compatible with long-term safety in the eye.",
              "For example, anterior chamber IOLs often spun around in the anterior chamber and damaged the corneal endothelium.",
              "Iris-fixated lenses often led to pupillary distortion and uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema (UGH) syndrome.",
              "When ICCE lost its popularity, IOLs were then designed with the intent of posterior chamber implantation.",
              "An American ophthalmologist, Steven Shearing, is credited with bringing IOL design into the modern era.",
              "In the 1970s he designed a lens that could center itself in the same position where the natural lens was positioned (behind the iris).",
              "As advances continued in cataract surgical techniques, a more structurally sound place for the IOL to reside was created: the capsular bag.",
              "In 1980 the first foldable lens arrived on the scene, which further improved outcomes.",
              "Foldable IOLs are made of flexible material (acrylic or silicone), allowing insertion into the eye through an even smaller incision.",
              "Since the 1970s, remarkable advances have occurred in IOL technology, design, and material.",
              "In 1992, astigmatism correction became possible when the first toric IOL was developed.",
              "18 Since then, improvements in the toric IOL model have led to excellent results and increased freedom from spectacle correction.",
              "The challenge of correcting presbyopia was taken on with the introduction of multifocal IOLs in the 1990s and of accommodating IOLs in 2000.",
              "A multifocal IOL acts like a bifocal inside the eye.",
              "It has multiple zones on the surface that will focus distance and near at all times.",
              "An accommodating IOL attempts to behave like the natural lens: when viewing an intermediate or near target, the lens is designed to flex forward to focus on the target.",
              "Equally important as lens design is lens power.",
              "Just as glasses and contact lens powers need to be measured for each individual, so do IOL powers.",
              "When determining IOL power, multiple variables play a role, such as corneal refractive power, anterior chamber depth, length of the eye, and location of the lens when it is placed in the eye.",
              "Since IOL implantation became the standard of care in the 1970s, various mathematical formulas taking these variables into account have been utilized to calculate lens power.",
              "During the past 20 years, the developments in IOL calculation methods and measuring devices have been astonishing and have resulted in more precise postoperative refractive outcomes.",
              "Freedom from spectacles after cataract surgery is now more of an expectation than a mere possibility.",

              "Typically such refractive error is not significant and is tolerated, and can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses if needed.",
              "When the refractive error is significant or intolerable to the patient, an IOL exchange may be required.",
              "Although an IOL exchange is a safe procedure in the hands of an experienced surgeon, it still subjects the patient to the risks associated with a second intraocular procedure, such as macular edema, vitreous loss, corneal edema, infection, wound leak, and prolonged inflammation.",

              "History of Cataract Surgery - EyeWiki",
              "A cataract is a pathologic condition in which the lens of the eye becomes opacified causing changes in vision that may include blurriness, color changes, halos around light, and at its worst blindness.",
              "There are many causes and risk factors for developing a cataract, however the most common cause is a senile cataract in which the clouding of the lens is caused by aging[1].",
              "For this reason, it is not surprising that cataracts are a leading cause of blindness worldwide affecting over 20 million in 2010, with the incidence projected to increase[2].",
              "Prior to the 1700s some people thought cataracts were caused by opaque liquid material flowing through the lens hence the etymology of cataract is from the Latin word \u201ccataracta\u201d which means waterfall - or perhaps because sometimes a dense cataract can resemble one to the imaginative viewer[3].",
              "When cataracts cause visual impairment, surgical intervention is currently the only method for treatment.",
              "Fortunately, because of advances in technology, cataracts can now be removed and replaced with an intraocular lens (IOL) with a low complication rate.",
              "One of the earliest surgical interventions for cataracts, dating as early as the 5th century BC, was a technique called couching, which comes from the french word \u201ccoucher\u201d meaning \u201cto put to bed.",
              "\u201d In this method, a sharp needle is used to pierce the eye near the limbus until the provider can manually dislodge the cataract - typically into the vitreous chamber - and out of the visual axis.",
              "However, the lack of aseptic technique and rough nature of the procedure resulted in poor outcomes[4].",
              "Some common complications include secondary glaucoma, hyphema, endophthalmitis, and often results in blindness.",
              "Unfortunately, couching is a traditional procedure that is still used today in parts of the world like Northern Nigeria and West Africa due to a multifactorial combination of unfamiliarity of modern procedures, fear of surgery, and preference of relying on traditional methods[4][5].",
              "While many used the couching technique, there are texts as early as 600 BC that document the use of a primitive extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) - meaning the lens is removed and the lens capsule is left in place - by an Indian surgeon named Sushruta.",
              "A translation of the original text in Sanskrit discloses the following operative technique: a sharp needle punctured the eye through the aqueous humor until reaching the capsule of the lens where the surgeon would make an incision.",
              "The patient was then instructed to valsalva with a closed nostril until lens material came out of the incision and the patient\u2019s vision improved.",
              "Postoperatively, indigenous roots and leaves were applied in a bandage and the patient was instructed to lie flat and avoid strenuous activities including cough and sneezing[6].",
              "For centuries despite some documentation of primitive ECCE, couching was the main procedure for cataracts until 1747 when French surgeon Jacques Daviel, often credited as the father of modern cataract extraction surgery, performed an ECCE.",
              "He would make a corneal incision > 10 mm with a corneal knife, then use a blunted needle to puncture the lens capsule, and extract the lens using a spatula and curette.",
              "Post operative care included dressing the eye with a cotton dressing soaked in wine and lying in a darkened room for a few days.",
              "Although this was a great advancement from couching, significant complications were prevalent such as posterior capsular opacification, retained cataracts, and infection[4] [7].",
              "While Daviel was credited as the first to perform ECCE, in 1753 a London surgeon by the name Samuel Sharp is the earliest documented to perform intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE), this involves the removal of the opacified lens and the surrounding capsule in one piece.",
              "There are different variations to this method but essentially all of them require lysing the zonular fibers that support the lens capsule and followed by subsequent removal of the lens-bag complex through a large limbal incision.",
              "Unfortunately, because the lens capsule acts as a barrier between the anterior and posterior chamber, its removal often causes vitreous prolapse and subsequent retinal detachments among other complications.",
              "Furthermore, removing the lens and capsule in one piece requires a large incision, resulting in longer healing times and higher infection rate[4].",
              "An important function of the natural lens is to refract light waves so that they are focused on the retina, providing a clear image.",
              "Patients without such lenses are considered aphakic and before the advent of intraocular lenses (IOLs) required often high-powered, bulky spectacles, which often led to poor visual quality.",
              "In fact, Sir Harold Ridley exclaimed that \u201cextraction alone is but half the cure for cataract.",
              "\u201d During World War II, Dr.",
              "Ridley observed that one of the Royal Airforce pilots had sustained shrapnel ocular trauma from plastic and despite having a foreign body, remained largely asymptomatic for years.",
              "This inspired a collaboration with the Plastics Division of Imperial Chemical Industries to develop the first IOL made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), mainly used in airplanes at that time.",

              "His work was met with disdain as this was a revolutionary idea of inserting a foreign object inside the eye.",
              "Further criticism stemmed from complications such as glaucoma, inflammation, inability to individualize the refractive strength of the IOL, and frequent dislocation of the IOL.",
              "Dr.",
              "Ridley admits that further work was necessary to address many of the complications, but his innovative work paved the way for modern advancements in IOL and cataract surgery[4] [8].",
              "In 1978, Kai-yi Zhou implanted the first foldable IOL made of silicone.",
              "Some of the benefits of the foldable IOL are easier implantation and a small incision, resulting in less induced astigmatism, faster healing and fewer infections[9].",
              "The conglomeration of foldable IOL, use of topical anesthetics in 1993 by Fischman, and the introduction of phacoemulsification in 1967 by Dr.",
              "Charles Kelman allowed for the modern extraction of cataracts to be effective and safer[10].",
              "Phacoemulsification uses ultrasound to break up the cataract and then subsequently the cataract is aspirated from the eye.",
              "This development allowed surgeons to decrease the incision in the eye from 10mm to typically less than 3mm, which has the benefits of shorter recovery times, more stable surgery, and lower complication rate.",

              "Particularly with regard to the Ayurvedic (ancient Indian) literature, we saw great discrepancies between statements made in the medical literature (including ophthalmology), and the most authoritative Indology sources, in particular the encyclopedia on Sanskrit medical literature written by Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld (1928\u20132017) (1).",
              "For instance, the ophthalmology literature states flatly that there was a man named Sus\u0301ruta who lived in 600 BCE, or perhaps 800 BCE, who performed cataract surgery and then wrote about it.",

              "However, we noted from the treatise by the ophthalmic historian Julius Hirschberg that many accounts of couching during the Ayurvedic, medieval Arabic, and modern Indian periods involved the patient inhaling during or just after the procedure, rather than exhaling.",
              "To better understand these discrepancies, we resolved to review the original source documents whenever possible.",
              "To this end, we enlisted the aid of our co-author (AK), who conducts research into Ayurvedic medicine in the ancient Sanskrit compositions at the Department of Indological Studies, Kyoto University.",
              "With respect to other languages as well, reviewing original source documents altered the conclusions in some cases.",
              "For instance, according to the English translation of Hirschberg, which was 3 steps removed from the 1826 description of Peter Breton in Calcutta, the patient exhaled deliberately after cataract couching.",
              "However, Breton actually reported that the patient was asked to inhale forcefully (2).",

              "Some societies operated on pterygia or superficial ocular growths by passing a thorn or hook below the opacity, lifting, and then, in some cases, cutting the opacity (4).",

              "In this cultural region, tablets were never fired deliberately as the clay was recycled on an annual basis.",
              "However, some of the tablets were \"fired\" as a result of uncontrolled fires in the buildings where they were stored.",
              "The rest, remain tablets of unfired clay and are therefore extremely fragile.",

              "In that way, the exact number of goods involved in a transaction could be recorded.",
              "This convention began when people developed agriculture and settled into permanent communities that were centered on increasingly large and organized trading marketplaces.",
              "[5] These marketplaces were purposed for the trade of sheep, grain, and bread loaves, where transactions were recorded with clay tokens.",

              "Whereas therapeutic texts arrange their descriptions of sicknesses from head to foot and generally depict bodily signs without reference to time, the second chapter of the Diagnostic Handbook organizes medical signs in head-to-foot order and assigns them to the first day of the patient\u2019s sickness.",
              "In this way, the handbook sketches out how a healer progresses in his knowledge of the sickness\u2014initially attempting to discover and interpret bodily signs in ways typical of omen divination, and only later arriving at a settled verdict on the sickness\u2019s identity and its remedy.",
              "The blueprint, therefore, paints a realistic picture of medical practice that runs through the handbook\u2019s six chapters, which can be summarized as follows: En route to the patient\u2019s house, the healer encounters omen signs on whether the patient would recover (Sa-gig Chapter 1).",
              "Meeting the patient on the first day of sickness, the healer surveys the body from head to foot for medical signs (Chapter 2).",

              "Prognoses foretell whether the patient lives or dies\u2014but even verdicts of death were not inevitable, since they could be remedied by apotropaic means, and therefore are not equivalent to our notion of \u201cterminal\u201d illness.",
              "Some try to identify medical signs in the handbook with diseases known today, but such retrospective diagnoses are often unreliable\u2014based on highly subjective interpretations of the ancient text, and underestimating the extent to which diseases can change (\u201cpathomorphosis\u201d) due to the evolution of human\u2013microbial relationships, as well as the role of culture and society in defining disease.",

              "The earliest, created by the Sumerian ruler Ur-Nammu of the city of Ur, dates all the way back to the 21st century B.",
              "C.",
              ", and evidence also shows that the Sumerian Code of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin was drawn up nearly two centuries before Hammurabi came to power.",
              "These earlier codes both bear a striking resemblance to Hammurabi\u2019s commands in their style and content, suggesting they may have influenced one another or perhaps even derived from a similar source.",
              "Hammurabi\u2019s Code is one of the most famous examples of the ancient precept of \u201clex talionis,\u201d or law of retribution, a form of retaliatory justice commonly associated with the saying \u201can eye for an eye.",
              "\u201d Under this system, if a man broke the bone of one his equals, his own bone would be broken in return.",
              "Capital crimes, meanwhile, were often met with their own unique and grisly death penalties.",
              "If a son and mother were caught committing incest, they were burned to death;",
              "if a pair of scheming lovers conspired to murder their spouses, both were impaled.",
              "Even a relatively minor crime could earn the offender a horrific fate.",
              "For example, if a son hit his father, the Code demanded the boy\u2019s hands be \u201chewn off.",
              "\u201d For crimes that could not be proven or disproven with hard evidence (such as claims of sorcery), the Code allowed for a \u201ctrial by ordeal\u201d\u2014an unusual practice where the accused was placed in a potentially deadly situation as a way of determining innocence.",
              "The Code notes that if an accused man jumps into the river and drowns, his accuser \u201cshall take possession of his house.",
              "\u201d However, if the gods spared the man and allowed him to escape unhurt, the accuser would be executed, and the man who jumped in the river would receive his house.",
              "Hammurabi\u2019s Code took a brutal approach to justice, but the severity of criminal penalties often depended on the identity of both the lawbreaker and the victim.",
              "While one law commanded, \u201cIf a man knock out the teeth of his equal, his teeth shall be knocked out,\u201d committing the same crime against a member of a lower class was punished with only a fine.",
              "Other rank-based penalties were even more significant.",
              "If a man killed a pregnant \u201cmaid-servant,\u201d he was punished with a monetary fine, but if he killed a \u201cfree-born\u201d pregnant woman, his own daughter would be killed as retribution.",
              "The Code also listed different punishments for men and women with regard to marital infidelity.",
              "Men were allowed to have extramarital relationships with maid-servants and slaves, but philandering women were to be bound and tossed into the Euphrates along with their lovers.",
              "Hammurabi\u2019s Code was surprisingly ahead of its time when it came to laws addressing subjects like divorce, property rights and the prohibition of incest, but perhaps most progressive of all was a stipulation mandating an ancient form of minimum wage.",
              "Several edicts in the Code referenced specific occupations and dictated how much the workers were to be paid.",
              "Field laborers and herdsmen were guaranteed a wage of \u201ceight gur of corn per year,\u201d and ox drivers and sailors received six gur.",
              "Doctors, meanwhile, were entitled to 5 shekels for healing a freeborn man of a broken bone or other injury, but only three shekels for a freed slave and two shekels for a slave.",
              "While it\u2019s notorious for its catalogue of barbaric punishments, Hammurabi\u2019s Code also set several valuable legal precedents that have survived to this day.",
              "The compendium is among the earliest legal documents to put forth a doctrine of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.",
              "\u201d In fact, the Code places the burden of proof on the accuser in extreme fashion when it says, \u201cIf any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death.",
              "\u201d The Code also includes a modern take on judicial procedures.",
              "For example, when two parties had a dispute, legal protocol allowed them to bring their case before a judge and provide evidence and witnesses to back up their claims. Hammurabi\u2019s Code offers a valuable glimpse into what daily life in ancient Babylonia might have been like, but just how the laws functioned in society is still up for debate.",
              "The statutes could have been a list of amendments to an even earlier and more expansive set of general laws, but they might also have acted as a set of judicial precedents compiled from real world cases.",
              "Some historians have even argued the Code was not a working legal document at all, but rather a piece of royal propaganda created to enshrine Hammurabi as a great and just ruler.",
              "However the Code operated, there is little doubt that the pillar itself was intended for public display.",

              "Medical Malpractice Reform: Historical ... - AMA Journal of Ethics",
              "Legal responsibility for medical malpractice is not a new concept, with a history that can be traced back to the Code of Hammurabi in 2030 BCE [1].",
              "Roman law recognized medical malpractice as a legal wrong, and this concept was expanded and introduced to continental Europe around 1200 CE [1].",
              "English common law, from its medieval origins, \u201cprovide[s] an unbroken line of medical malpractice decisions, all the way to modern times\u201d [2].",
              "Derived from English common law, United States medical malpractice law\u2014grounded in the legal concept of tort law\u2014has evolved through decades of state and federal court decisions and been modified by legislative intervention [1].",
              "As Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines it, \u201cA tort is a legal wrong committed upon the person or property independent of contract\u201d [3].",
              "It is an umbrella concept encompassing myriad categories such as negligence, gross negligence, professional negligence, recklessness, and acts of intentional harm (referred to as intentional torts).",
              "Medical malpractice is a form of professional negligence, since professionals discharging their professional duties are expected to act with a higher standard of care than nonprofessionals.",
              "To prevail in a medical malpractice claim against a physician, the injured party (the patient or patient\u2019s family) must demonstrate that it was more likely than not (this requirement is known as the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard) that the following four elements were present: (1) the physician had a duty to the patient;",
              "(2) the physician was negligent in his or her execution of the duty, (i.",
              "e., by breaching the standard of care);",
              "(3) the physician\u2019s negligent action was the proximate cause of the patient\u2019s injuries;",
              "and (4) the patient\u2019s injury resulted in damages, whether economic or other [4].",
              "A breach of a physician\u2019s duty to patients can take many forms. For example, injuries may result from misdiagnosis, errors in the choice or technical execution of procedures, improper administration of medications, failure to follow up appropriately with a patient, and failure to obtain adequate informed consent [5].",
              "The standard of care requirement means that the finder of fact, typically the jury, must hear testimony from both sides of the litigation about what the standard of care is and then evaluate that information to decide if the physician breached it, i.",
              "e., whether a reasonably prudent physician confronting similar circumstances would not have acted as the defendant physician did.",
              "Studdert, Mello, and Brennan state that \u201c[t]here are three social goals of malpractice litigation: to deter unsafe practices, to compensate persons injured through negligence, and to exact corrective justice\u201d [6].",
              "Thus, patients might reasonably expect medical malpractice law to serve as a deterrent to the improper practice of medicine and to compensate\u2014through a negotiated settlement or a trial\u2014patients who are victims of physician negligence.",
              "However, only a small number of harmed patients receive compensation, and a large number of compensated patients appear not to be victims of actual negligence [7, 8].",
              "As Kessler [9] asserts, \u201c[w]hile it is more difficult to assess the extent to which the malpractice system has provided incentives for appropriate care, a variety of evidence suggests that it has not\u201d [10].",
              "A significant literature suggests that physicians believe that pressure to avoid malpractice litigation leads to \u201cdefensive medicine\u201d [9, 11].",
              "Defensive medicine is medical practice performed primarily to limit future risk of a successful lawsuit against the physician and only secondarily to adhere to the medical standard of care.",
              "Defensive medicine can lead to a broad set of consequences: providing care that is \u201cunproductive, not cost effective, or even harmful\u201d or \u201cdeclining to supply care that could be beneficial\u201d [10].",
              "Additionally, defensive medicine can also inflict moral harm on the physician and damage the patient-physician relationship.",
              "Defensive medicine is problematic ethically because it moves the focus of medical care away from the best interests of the patient toward the best interests of the physician.",
              "The ethical consequences of this change in focus are considerable.",
              "As Rentmeester and George write, when a practitioner orients herself to a patient defensively, for example, the scope of her moral perception narrows and she draws her concern away from her patient toward herself.",
              "This kind of physician-centered practice suggests a physician\u2019s narrowed moral outlook toward her patients: what constitutes a reason to respond with care to a patient is defined narrowly (instead of broadly), exclusively (instead of inclusively), and meagerly (instead of generously) [12].",
              "Studies measuring the effect of malpractice pressure on malpractice premiums, claims frequency, or claims severity tend to find evidence of defensive, unproductive care [7, 13, 14].",
              "The costs of defensive medicine to the health care system, which a Cleveland Clinic study estimated to be $6 billion\u2014in addition to the economic and noneconomic costs of malpractice litigation itself\u2014have driven advocacy for malpractice reform [15].",
              "Furthermore, it appears that medical malpractice tort reform does have a positive impact on the health care bottom line.",
              "For example, the Congressional Budget Office concluded in 2009 that \u201cthe weight of the empirical evidence now demonstrates a link between tort reform and the use of healthcare services\u201d [16].",
              "This article examines this country\u2019s historical approach to medical malpractice, traditional reform models, proposals based on alternative models, and the role of mediation and ethics consultation in medical malpractice cases.",
              "In the United States, medical malpractice claims began to appear in the 1800s [17], but it was not until the 1960s that a surge of medical malpractice claims appeared in the courts [18].",
              "This surge was likely driven by a number of factors: new and more complex treatments with higher risks of iatrogenic harm, a changing legal landscape that removed barriers to lawsuits and changed liability rules that had previously shielded charitable institutions from suit, and changes in satisfaction with the health care system, among others [19].",
              "The rising incidence and costs of malpractice litigation led organized medicine to lobby for state and federal interventions to curb the burdens of the current malpractice liability system [9].",
              "Medical malpractice reform is the product of political processes, whereby groups with different interests attempt to push their agendas.",
              "Physicians and physician organizations have tended to view most medical malpractice claims as spurious and injurious to the medical system, whereas patient advocates view the malpractice system as both a deterrent against the practice of dangerous medicine and an avenue for much-deserved compensation for injured patients [9].",
              "In 2011, the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) compiled an analysis of medical malpractice reform goals and initiatives [20].",
              "The NCSL sought to address the challenges of cost containment while acknowledging that medical malpractice reform (i.",
              "e., tort reform) needs to address three major areas: limiting the costs associated with medical malpractice, deterring medical errors, and ensuring fair compensation for patients who are harmed [20].",
              "Traditionally, reforms have attempted to change the medical malpractice climate in one of three ways: (1) allowing fewer lawsuits by creating barriers to filing, such as a prefiling certification or review of the medical merits of the case [20];",
              "(2) limiting plaintiffs\u2019 compensation by imposing damage caps for noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering [21];",
              "or (3) changing how awards are paid out to plaintiffs (payments over time versus large lump-sum settlements) [22].",
              "Caps on noneconomic damages are the most common types of reforms and have been implemented in over half the states in various forms [23].",
              "Hyman and colleagues used claim-level data to estimate the effect of Texas\u2019s 2003 cap on noneconomic damages on jury verdicts, post-verdict payouts, and settlements in medical malpractice cases closed during 1988-2004.",
              "The investigators found that the cap affected 47 percent of verdicts favoring plaintiffs and reduced mean allowed noneconomic damages by 73 percent and mean total payout by 27 percent.",
              "The noneconomic damages cap affected 18 percent of cases settled without trial and reduced predicted mean total payout by 18 percent [24].",
              "In addition to affecting indemnity payments, it appears that damage caps also modestly reduce the rise in malpractice insurance premiums [25].",
              "Although malpractice reform in the form of caps on noneconomic damages may reduce the actual payouts to plaintiffs, the broader impact of these reforms on reducing defensive medicine is less clear.",
              "Waxman and colleagues attempted to gauge the impact of these reforms on emergency department care in three states with malpractice reform\u2014Texas, South Carolina, and Georgia\u2014as compared to neighboring states without reforms [26].",
              "Using a 5 percent random sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, the investigators identified all emergency department visits to hospitals in the three reform states and in neighboring (control) states from 1997 through 2011.",
              "They examined pre- and post-reform changes in the use of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, per-visit emergency department charges, and the rate of hospital admissions and they did not find any policy-attributable reduction in care intensity: no significant reduction in the rates of CT or MRI utilization or hospital admission in any of the three reform states and no significant reduction in charges in Texas or South Carolina was found.",
              "Georgia, however, did see a modest 3.",
              "6 percent reduction in per-visit emergency department charges [26].",
              "While traditional malpractice reform efforts could reduce the number and success of malpractice lawsuits in some states, they do little to help patients injured by physician negligence obtain what research suggests they truly desire: (1) an account of why the harm occurred;",
              "(2) an apology from the health care professionals involved;",
              "(3) information about how similar harms can be avoided in the future;",
              "and (4) appropriate restitution for an avoidable harm [27].",
              "Society as a whole has an interest in cultivating a medical system in which medical practitioners do not practice defensive medicine but rather engage in process improvement at both the individual level and the system level.",
              "Therefore, to be effective, medical malpractice reform must balance the needs of all parties.",
              "The health care system must promote a culture of open communication between clinicians and patients that persists even after a patient has experienced a negative outcome (regardless of who or what is to blame), allows for robust process improvement, and offers compensation to injured parties.",
              "A possible beneficial effect of such a culture may be that patients trust their physicians when physicians truthfully explain that a poor outcome was due to the natural history of disease rather than the negligent practice of medicine.",
              "Such a system would be adversarial only as a last resort, and even under those circumstances it should build on mediation-based models such as communication and resolution programs, discussed in more detail below.",
              "A 2013 study estimated that between 210,000 to 400,000 people die annually in the US due to medical error [28].",
              "Ethically, a reformed medical malpractice system must address the fact that medical errors do injure patients and are at play in a significant number of malpractice cases.",
              "For example, Studdert and colleagues analyzed 1,452 closed malpractice claims from five liability insurers and concluded that 63 percent of the claims did, in fact, involve injuries due to medical error [29].",
              "Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) models, which allow physicians and the health systems in which they operate to acknowledge openly when errors have occurred and offer reasonable compensation to the injured parties, balance the needs of clinicians\u2014to act ethically by being truthful and engaging in vigorous quality improvement\u2014and of patients\u2014to receive compensation for negligence-induced iatrogenic harm.",
              "Alternative dispute resolution allows litigants to move out of a \u201cbattle\u201d mentality and into a facilitated conversation to achieve resolution of the conflict.",
              "Alternative dispute resolution typically includes either mediation or arbitration.",
              "These two approaches are quite different, but both can be quite effective in resolving disputes in a less adversarial and less costly manner than traditional litigation [30].",
              "A number of health care institutions have experimented with a unique twist on ADR by developing communication and resolution programs (CRPs), novel approaches to addressing medical error that have paid off in terms of the costs associated with malpractice litigation [31-34].",
              "These programs encourage open communication and transparency with patients and their families and facilitate restitution for injured parties when appropriate.",
              "They also support physicians in disclosure conversations with patients.",
              "The Lexington, Kentucky, Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center was a pioneer in this area.",
              "In 1987, the Lexington VA implemented its CRP, which provided a full disclosure of the occurrence that led to harm as well as an expression of regret on behalf of the institution and its personnel [33].",
              "Under this system, patients and their families are invited to bring attorneys to discuss offers of compensation early in the process.",
              "Although ADR in a health care situation likely provides a number of benefits to both the health care provider (by promoting honesty and ethical behavior) and to the patient and patient\u2019s family (by providing an honest accounting of what happened, including a statement of regret and possibly an offer of compensation), the empirical literature discussing ADR typically emphasizes quantitative, economic measures in the form of payouts as a measure of success.",
              "With the implementation of this program, the Lexington VA became the VA hospital with the lowest payouts.",
              "Between 1990 and 1996, the average settlement per claim in Lexington was approximately $15,622 [33], whereas in other VA institutions it was $98,000.",
              "Additionally, the average duration of cases decreased from 2-4 years to 2-4 months [35].",
              "CRPs also exist outside the VA system and come in two varieties: early settlement and limited reimbursement [36].",
              "The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) was the first non-VA health system to adopt a CRP, implementing an early settlement model in 2001.",
              "UMHS self-insures [37];",
              "all its physicians are employed and insured by the university rather than by commercial malpractice carriers, thereby simplifying buy-in to the CRP.",
              "This model has four components: (1) acknowledging when patients are injured due to medical error;",
              "(2) compensating fairly (commensurate with degree of harm) and quickly when there is a deviation from the standard of care;",
              "(3) aggressively defending against meritless cases;",
              "and (4) studying all adverse events to determine how health care delivery can be improved.",
              "Because the payments are made on behalf of the institution only, they are not reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) [36].",
              "This operational detail is significant because the NPDB, which was created by Congress, \u201ccontains information on medical malpractice payments and certain adverse actions related to health care practitioners, entities, providers, and suppliers\u201d [38].",
              "It is publically available information that may affect a physician\u2019s reputation and follows a physician throughout his or her career.",
              "By not reporting this information to the NPDB, UMHS reduces an important barrier to physician participation in this CRP.",
              "In a retrospective chart review of UMHS claims reported in the eight years before and the five years after full implementation of the CRP in 2003, investigators compared the number of new claims for compensation, the number of claims compensated, the time to claim resolution, and claims-related costs from 1995-2007 [31].",
              "After full implementation of the CRP, the average monthly rate of new claims decreased from 7.",
              "03 to 4.",
              "52 per 100,000 patient encounters, the average monthly rate of lawsuits decreased from 2.",
              "13 to 0.",
              "75 per 100,000 patient encounters, and the median time from claim reporting to resolution decreased from 1.",
              "36 to 0.",
              "95 years.",
              "Moreover, the average monthly cost rates decreased by at least 50 percent for total liability, patient compensation, and noncompensation-related legal cost [31].",
              "The model employed by COPIC Insurance Company, a large medical liability insurer in Colorado, is an example of a limited-reimbursement model, the second type of CRP.",
              "In 2000 COPIC developed its 3Rs program\u2014Recognize, Respond, and Resolve\u2014to address situations in which their enrollees\u2019 patients were unsatisfied with their health outcomes [32, 39].",
              "When patients suffer adverse outcomes they receive a disclosure of what occurred and compensation for out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance (up to $25,000) and for lost time (up to $5,000).",
              "Disclosure and compensation occur without a determination of physician fault.",
              "Patients retain the right to sue, and payments are not reportable to the NPDB.",
              "Physician participation is voluntary, and participating physicians undergo disclosure training.",
              "Exclusion criteria include death, clear negligence, attorney involvement, a complaint to the state board, and a written demand for payment.",
              "From October 2000 to October 2007, there were 4,800 qualified events, with 1,026 patients receiving payments averaging $5,286.",
              "Seven paid cases were litigated, and only two resulted in tort compensation.",
              "Sixteen unpaid cases were litigated, and six resulted in tort compensation.",
              "Anecdotal evidence and survey data suggest to the COPIC leadership that the system is successful.",
              "The majority of physicians and patients find the system effective and only a small fraction of cases that go through the 3R system evolve into litigated and compensated claims. Because of the open disclosure and compensation, the animosity between the injured patient and the physician appears to be reduced, and many patients maintain their therapeutic relationship with their physician [32].",
              "CRPs are one innovative approach to medical malpractice reform that address both patient and institutional needs.",
              "CRPs require, however, a culture shift in the medical community and a management of expectations on the part of injured patients who may be anticipating larger payouts than they are offered in this type of system.",
              "CRPs also require a favorable legal environment;",
              "they work best if \u201capology laws\u201d explicitly protect clinicians and health institutions from penalty for discussing adverse events openly and honestly with patients and their families.",
              "Currently, apology and disclosure laws in the majority of states do not go far enough in fostering open communication after a medical error has occurred.",
              "A 2010 study of state apology laws found that the laws of 34 states and the District of Columbia were not written in ways that foster open and honest communication between the physician and the injured party [40].",
              "Of these jurisdictions, 25 states and the District of Columbia had \u201csympathy only\u201d laws.",

              "In addition, rights documents, which presumably are intended to protect the rights-bearer, increasingly are accompanied by statements of the responsibilities of the rightsbearer.",
              "The American Medical Association, for example, includes among the responsibilities of patients the provision of accurate and complete information and compliance with the treatment plan and instructions of those responsible for the patient's care.",

              "In the United States, the debates over access to experimental drugs by seriously ill patients and silicone implants by women seeking breast augmentation exemplify the dilemma.",
              "Religious and broad philosophical ethics also affect individuals in this category.",
              "Usually individuals have elected to follow the precepts of a particular ethic in their overall existence and bring that ethic into whatever situation they encounter.",

              "Ethics directives that pertain to nonprofessionals tend to be minimalistic.",
              "They set guidelines protecting basic concerns such as respect, privacy, and competence, but unlike their professional counterparts, the job descriptions of nonprofessionals do not include a unique ethical mandate.",
              "Nonprofessionals, like their professional counterparts, may be subject to certain duties to the institution or organization employing them.",
              "Similarly, nonprofessional workers are subject to moral standards articulated by legal and governmental bodies, as well as those stemming from religious or philosophical worldviews.",
              "The problem of conflicting duties arising from multiple moral authorities affects nonprofessionals, but not to the same degree as it plagues professionals.",
              "The conflicts faced by the nonprofessional are more analogous to those faced by any human being when the demands of law or one's employer conflict with a broader ethic that is perceived to be more fundamental.",
              "This is not to imply that these conflicts are any less difficult to resolve, only that their nature is different.",
              "The number and diversity of bioethics documents reflect the pluralism of our world.",
              "When the ideologies expressed in these documents clash, controversy and conflicts may arise.",

              "Frederick II, (born December 26, 1194, Jesi, Ancona, Papal States [Italy]\u2014died December 13, 1250, Castel Fiorentino, Apulia, Kingdom of Sicily), king of Sicily (1197\u20131250), duke of Swabia (as Frederick VI, 1228\u201335), German king (1212\u201350), and Holy Roman emperor (1220\u201350).",
              "A Hohenstaufen and grandson of Frederick I Barbarossa, he pursued his dynasty\u2019s imperial policies against the papacy and the Italian city-states.",
              "He also joined in the Sixth Crusade (1228\u201329), conquering several areas of the Holy Land and crowning himself king of Jerusalem (reigning 1229\u201343).",
              "In 1196, Frederick, at the age of two, was elected king by the German princes at Frankfort.",
              "His father, however, failed in his attempt to gain the princes\u2019 support to make Frederick\u2019s succession hereditary.",
              "Just before embarking on a Crusade to the Holy Land, Emperor Henry died in September 1197 after a brief illness, only 32 years old.",
              "Though the medieval Roman Empire was at the height of its strength, the emperor\u2019s death brought it close to dissolution.",
              "After the death of her husband, Empress Constance had young Frederick brought to Sicily, where in May 1198 he was crowned king of Sicily.",
              "Before her death later that year, Constance loosened the bonds that joined Sicily to the empire and to Germany by appointing Pope Innocent III her son\u2019s guardian as well as regent of the Kingdom of Sicily, which was already under papal suzerainty.",
              "In Germany two rival kings were elected, Frederick\u2019s uncle Philip of Swabia and Otto of Brunswick, as Otto IV.",
              "Even the pope, however, did not succeed in protecting Sicily from many years of anarchy.",
              "German and papal captains, local barons, and Sicilian Saracens, as well as the cities of Genoa and Pisa, fought for mastery of the country.",
              "The situation was not stabilized until the imperial chancellor conquered Palermo in November 1206 and governed in Frederick\u2019s name.",
              "In December 1208 Frederick, then 14, was declared of age.",
              "In 1209 he married the much older Constance of Aragon, who brought him an urgently needed troop of knights with whose help he gained control of Sicily, defeated a conspiracy of the barons, and was partially successful in regaining the crown properties that had been lost during his minority.",
              "At this time his relations with the pope began to show signs of strain.",
              "Frederick\u2019s Sicilian efforts were seriously endangered when at the end of 1210 Otto IV invaded the realm on the mainland and in 1211 even threatened Sicily itself.",
              "Otto withdrew, however, when in September 1211 a number of German princes deposed him and elected Frederick king.",
              "Before leaving for Germany in March 1212, Frederick had his one-year-old son Henry VII crowned king of Sicily and granted various privileges to the Holy See.",
              "Having rapidly conquered south Germany, where he met almost no opposition, Frederick was elected once again king of Germany by a large majority of princes at Frankfurt in December 1212 and crowned a few days later.",
              "In the same year he concluded an alliance with France against Otto, who was decisively defeated at the Battle of Bouvines in July 1214.",
              "In April 1220 Frederick\u2019s nine-year-old son, Henry VII, was elected king by the German princes, thus negating Frederick\u2019s promise to Pope Innocent that he would relinquish control of Sicily in favour of Henry, for it meant that Sicily and Germany would eventually be united under one ruler.",
              "Although Frederick sought to exonerate himself with Pope Honorius III by claiming that the election had been held without his knowledge, he had to pay for it by surrendering extensive royal prerogatives to the German ecclesiastical princes.",
              "Crowned emperor by the pope in St.",
              "Peter\u2019s Church, in Rome, on November 22, 1220, Frederick confirmed on the same day the legal separation of the empire from the Kingdom of Sicily while continuing the existing personal union.",
              "In addition, he granted important privileges to the Italian ecclesiastics and issued laws against heretics, and it seemed indeed that harmony had been reestablished between the emperor and the pope for some years to come.",
              "Frederick spent the following years consolidating his rule in Sicily.",
              "He broke the resistance of the barons to revocation of certain of their privileges and defeated the rebellious Saracens (1222\u201324), whom he later resettled in Apulia where they became his most faithful subjects, providing him with a loyal bodyguard immune to papal influence.",
              "In addition to erecting a chain of castles and border fortifications, he had enlarged the harbours of his kingdom and established a navy and a fleet of merchant vessels.",
              "He instituted measures designed to bring trade under state control and make the manufacture of certain products the monopoly of the state.",
              "Finally, he created a civil service for which candidates were trained at the first European state university, in Naples, which he himself founded in 1224."

              "It is difficult to isolate the facts of Hippocrates\u2019 life from the later tales told about him or to assess his medicine accurately in the face of centuries of reverence for him as the ideal physician.",
              "About 60 medical writings have survived that bear his name, most of which were not written by him.",
              "He has been revered for his ethical standards in medical practice, mainly for the Hippocratic Oath, which, it is suspected, he did not write.",
              "It is known that while Hippocrates was alive, he was admired as a physician and teacher.",
              "His younger contemporary Plato referred to him twice.",
              "In the Protagoras Plato called Hippocrates \u201cthe Asclepiad of Cos\u201d who taught students for fees, and he implied that Hippocrates was as well known as a physician as Polyclitus and Phidias were as sculptors.",
              "It is now widely accepted that an \u201cAsclepiad\u201d was not a temple priest or a member of a physicians\u2019 guild but instead was a physician belonging to a family that had produced well-known physicians for generations.",
              "Plato\u2019s second reference occurs in the Phaedrus, in which Hippocrates is referred to as a famous Asclepiad who had a philosophical approach to medicine.",
              "Meno, a pupil of Aristotle, specifically stated in his history of medicine the views of Hippocrates on the causation of diseases, namely, that undigested residues were produced by unsuitable diet and that these residues excreted vapours, which passed into the body generally and produced diseases.",
              "Aristotle said that Hippocrates was called \u201cthe Great Physician\u201d but that he was small in stature (Politics).",
              "These are the only extant contemporary, or near-contemporary, references to Hippocrates.",
              "Five hundred years later, the Greek physician Soranus wrote a life of Hippocrates, but the contents of this and later lives were largely traditional or imaginative.",
              "Throughout his life Hippocrates appears to have traveled widely in Greece and Asia Minor practicing his art and teaching his pupils, and he presumably taught at the medical school at Cos quite frequently.",
              "His birth and death dates are traditional but may well be approximately accurate.",
              "Undoubtedly, Hippocrates was a historical figure, a great physician who exercised a permanent influence on the development of medicine and on the ideals and ethics of the physician.",
              "Hippocrates\u2019 reputation, and myths about his life and his family, began to grow in the Hellenistic period, about a century after his death.",
              "During this period, the Museum of Alexandria in Egypt collected for its library literary material from preceding periods in celebration of the past greatness of Greece.",
              "So far as it can be inferred, the medical works that remained from the Classical period (among the earliest prose writings in Greek) were assembled as a group and called the works of Hippocrates (Corpus Hippocraticum).",
              "Linguists and physicians subsequently wrote commentaries on them, and, as a result, all the virtues of the Classical medical works were eventually attributed to Hippocrates and his personality constructed from them.",
              "The virtues of the Hippocratic writings are many, and, although they are of varying lengths and literary quality, they are all simple and direct, earnest in their desire to help, and lacking in technical jargon and elaborate argument.",
              "The works show such different views and styles that they cannot be by one person, and some were clearly written in later periods.",
              "Yet all the works of the Corpus share basic assumptions about how the body works and what disease is, providing a sense of the substance and appeal of ancient Greek medicine as practiced by Hippocrates and other physicians of his era.",
              "Prominent among these attractive works are the Epidemics, which give annual records of weather and associated diseases, along with individual case histories and records of treatment, collected from cities in northern Greece.",
              "Diagnosis and prognosis are frequent subjects.",
              "Other treatises explain how to set fractures and treat wounds, feed and comfort patients, and take care of the body to avoid illness.",
              "Treatises called Diseases deal with serious illnesses, proceeding from the head to the feet, giving symptoms, prognoses, and treatments.",
              "There are works on diseases of women, childbirth, and pediatrics.",
              "Prescribed medications, other than foods and local salves, are generally purgatives to rid the body of the noxious substances thought to cause disease.",
              "Some works argue that medicine is indeed a science, with firm principles and methods, although explicit medical theory is very rare.",
              "The medicine depends on a mythology of how the body works and how its inner organs are connected.",
              "The myth is laboriously constructed from experience, but it must be remembered that there was neither systematic research nor dissection of human beings in Hippocrates\u2019 time.",
              "Hence, while much of the writing seems wise and correct, there are large areas where much is unknown.",
              "The Embassy, a fictional work that connects Hippocrates\u2019 family with critical events in the history of Cos and Greece, was included in the original collection of Hippocratic works in the Library of Alexandria.",
              "Over the next four centuries, The Embassy inspired other imaginative writings, including letters between Hippocrates and the Persian king and also the philosopher Democritus.",
              "Though obviously fiction, these works enhanced Hippocrates\u2019 reputation, providing the basis for later biographies and the traditional picture of Hippocrates as the father of medicine.",
              "Still other works were added to the Hippocratic Corpus between its first collection and its first scholarly edition around the beginning of the 2nd century ce.",
              "Among them were the Hippocratic Oath and other ethical writings that prescribe principles of behaviour for the physician.",

              "Surgery, pharmacy, and anatomy advanced;",
              "physiology became the subject of serious speculation;",
              "and philosophic criticism improved the logic of medical theories.",
              "Competing schools in medicine (first Empiricism and later Rationalism) claimed Hippocrates as the origin and inspiration of their doctrines.",
              "In the 2nd century ce, the physician Galen of Pergamum developed his magnificent medical system, a synthesis of preceding work and his own additions that became the basis of European and Arabic medicine into the Renaissance.",
              "Galen was argumentative and long-winded, often abusive of contemporaries and earlier physicians, but at the same time, with exaggerated reverence that ignored five centuries of progress, he claimed that Hippocrates was the source of all that he himself knew and practiced.",
              "For later physicians, Hippocrates stood as the inspirational source, while the more difficult Galen offered the substantial details.",
              "As time went on, reverence for the past had to contend with new notions of scientific method and new discoveries.",
              "In the process, Galen\u2019s authority was undone, but Hippocrates\u2019 eminence as father of medicine remained.",
              "Scientific progress in fields such as anatomy, chemistry, microbiology, and microscopy, especially beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries, demanded that Galen\u2019s medicine be criticized and revised part by part.",
              "Arguments against Galenic medicine were often more effective when they were presented as returns to true Hippocratic medicine.",
              "New scientific methodology argued for a return to observation and study of nature, abandoning bookish authority.",
              "The simple and direct writings of the Hippocratic Collection read well as sample empirical texts that eschewed dogma.",
              "By the late 19th century, Galen was irrelevant to medical practice, and general knowledge of Hippocratic medical writings was beginning to fade.",
              "However, today Hippocrates still continues to represent the humane, ethical aspects of the medical profession.",
              "A number of idealized images of Hippocrates have survived from antiquity, but none that seems to derive from a contemporary portrait."

              "Finally, all practices regarded detailed recordings and evaluation of information within the guidelines.",
              "The Hippocratic philosophy on health care provision focused on the holistic health care model, applying standards and ethical rules that are still valid today.",
              "It is widely accepted that the foundations of science and the study of physiology, anatomy and psychology in ancient Greece were developed in order to find the sources of diseases and to promote health status (1).",
              "Moreover, there were the moral obligations of individuals who were working in health and other fields of science (2).",
              "With the increasing developments in medical science, different perceptions were created as to the exercise of medical practice as a consequence of the formation of different medical schools.",
              "Among the most famous is that of Knidos physicians, where philosophy focused entirely on the disease that cumbered the patient (3).",
              "However, the most dominant philosophy thus far has been that of the Methodists (medical thinking), which was founded by Asclepius, and which focused on maintaining health and the importance of understanding the whole consideration of patients\u2019 health and health status (4).",
              "Following the Asclepius paradigm, Hippocrates focused on the \u201cnatural\u201d treatment to approach the disease (5).",
              "This approach is widely accepted even today, and thus Hippocrates is considered to be the founder of ancient Greek medicine.",
              "According to Kristen et al.",
              ", the focal point of Hippocratic medicine is the belief that medicine should be practiced as a scientific discipline based on the natural sciences, diagnosing and preventing diseases as well as treating them (6).",
              "Also, Hippocrates believed that the physician should study anatomy, in particular that of the spine and its relationship to the nervous system, which controls all functions of the body.",
              "In addition, he was the first who believed that this observation helps recognize the symptoms of each disease (7).",
              "Moreover, the Hippocratic tradition emphasized environmental causes and natural treatments of diseases, the causes and therapeutic importance of psychological factors, nutrition and lifestyle, independence of mind, body and spirit, and the need for harmony between the individual and the social and natural environment (8).",
              "Furthermore, the \u201cHippocratic\u201d physician above all made sure the patient was healthy as the practice of medicine so required (9).",
              "Surprisingly, the Hippocratic ideal is reflected in the Hippocratic Oath (the oath required for obtaining a medical license in Greece), which focuses on the integrity of the professional, benevolence and human dignity in the practice of medicine (7, 10).",
              "The aim of this paper is to present the philosophy of health and the provision of care at a physical and mental level in ancient Greece and to highlight the influence of the Hippocratic ideal in relation to modern health care practices.",
              "Literature review was held using the browsing method in international databases (Medline, Scopus and Proquest) during the period June 2011 to May 2012.",
              "One hundred and eighty five articles on the topic were browsed.",
              "In this literature review only seventeen reviews, eight original researches and nine general articles, met the inclusion criterion of medical interest, whereas a total of 151 references were excluded due to philosophical or archaeological reasons.",
              "The ancient Greeks believed that mental and physical health were interrelated as they had found that the body and mind should be in harmony.",
              "Aristotle believed that sports and gymnastics were essential to the development of the human body to optimize functional capacity and harmony between mind and body, hence the famous phrase \u201chealthy mind in a healthy body\u201d (11).",
              "This ascertainment has been confirmed by several recent studies reporting that students with mile run/walk times beyond California Fitness gram standards, or those whose body mass index (BMI) were higher than the sex- and age-specific standards suggested by Centers for Disease Control (CDC), performed less satisfactorily in academic tests than students with healthier BMI or better fitness level, even after taking parent education and other covariates into consideration (12).",
              "Another finding indicates that single, vigorous sessions of moderately intense aerobic exercise such as walking may boost cognitive attention control in preadolescent children.",
              "Moreover, moderate intensity exercise may serve to improve attention and scholastic performance.",
              "This data suggests that single sessions of exercise affect certain underlying processes that are beneficial to cognitive health and can be essential for satisfactory performance during a person\u2019s life (13).",
              "Additionally, girls taking part in longer sessions of physical education (70\u2013300 minutes per week) scored slightly but significantly higher in mathematics and reading (referent: 0\u201335 minutes per week).",
              "However, no such differences were observed among boys, whose academic achievement did not seem to be positively or negatively affected by longer sessions of physical education (14).",
              "Physical activity was a necessary part of the training done in schools primarily to promote physical and mental health (15).",
              "Health promotion appeared during the Olympic Games since the care of athletes and prevention of injuries were specialist services provided by instructors called \u201cpaidotrivai\u201d (16).",
              "According to Hippocrates\u2019s study \u201con food\u201d, for the exercises that were done by athletes, olive oil was used to increase body temperature, warm up and for muscles to be flexible so as to avoid sport injuries (17).",
              "Also, figs and other fruits with high glucose concentration that provide energy were offered to athletes to improve performance (18).",
              "Wars were a common phenomenon in ancient Greece.",
              "There are records that indicate treatment practices on wounds during the Trojan War and even treatment of infected wounds.",
              "For such treatments medicinal preparations were taken from nature, such as seawater, honey, vinegar, rainwater and medicinal plants in the form of powder (18).",
              "In Homer\u2019s \u201cIliada\u201d injuries and amputations that reflect the actual care of wounds are described in wars in ancient Greece, and Hippocrates noticed the separation of limb gangrene and made incisions between dead and alive tissue to treat the condition (19).",
              "Hippocrates\u2019s views were highly innovative for their time as he suggested chest tube output for possible liquid in external fixation and traction when aligning broken bones.",
              "He believed that in order to properly and quickly heal the wounds they must be kept dry, after being taken care of using pure water or wine (20).",
              "In addition, the formation of pus was considered a positive factor for the reduction of wound complications because of the frequent occurrence of infections.",
              "As a consequence, the combined findings of Hippocrates and Galen had an influence on surgical care practices of injuries and wounds until the Middle Ages (21).",
              "The first classification of mental disorders proposed by Hippocrates was: Mania, Melancholy, Phrenitis, Insanity, Disobedience, Paranoia, Panic, Epilepsy and Hysteria.",
              "Some of these terms are still used today (22).",
              "Psychological and mental illnesses were viewed as the effect of nature on man and were treated like other diseases.",
              "Hippocrates argued that the brain is the organ responsible for mental illnesses and that intelligence and sensitivity reach the brain through the mouth by breathing.",
              "Hippocrates believed that mental illnesses can be treated more effectively if they are handled in a similar manner to physical medical conditions (23).",
              "According to Hippocrates, the diagnosis and treatment of mental and physical diseases is based on observation, consideration of the causes, balance of theory and on the four liquids, blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile (22).",
              "Interestingly, Plato\u2019s theory mentions that the healing of body and soul may be either true or false, and medicine and gymnastics are classified as true treatments while in true healing of the soul we have the legislative and the judiciary.",
              "The role of music and theater in the treatment of physical and mental illnesses and the improvement of human behavior was essential.",
              "It was believed that healing the soul through music also healed the body, and there were specific musical applications for certain diseases.",
              "For instance, the alternating sound of the flute and harp served as a treatment for gout.",
              "Asclepius was the first to apply music as therapy to conquer \u201cpassion\u201d (24).",
              "Aristotle claims that in some, the effect of religious melodies that thrill the soul resembles those who have undergone medical treatment and mental catharsis (25).",
              "The ancient tragedies acted as psychotherapy for patients (26).",
              "The Theater of Epidaurus at the Ancient Temple of Epidaurus was the place where \u201ccatharsis\u201d or the release of emotions through performance took place.",
              "Moreover, \u201cquiet rooms\u201d were designed in which patients would go to sleep so that they could dream of being mentally healthy, and it was believed that this would help them to improve their mental health (27).",
              "The concept of \u201cphysis\u201d was first proposed by Hippocrates, who changed hieratic or theocratic medicine into a rational discipline.",
              "The basic structure of the Asclepieion in Kos points to the fact that Hippocrates believed in a holistic health care model, and in his school science met with drug therapy, diets, and physical and mental exercise, as well as divine solicitation (28).",
              "Furthermore, the Asclepieion of Kos offered all patients general treatment that included physical exercise, massage and walks considered necessary to restore health, well-being of the soul and the inner peace of man, and using dreams both for diagnostic and for therapeutic reasons (5, 29).",
              "To achieve the desired therapeutic result, the therapist should have prior understanding of the concept of soul and its distinction from the body according to the Platonic trisection of the soul (30).",
              "Another great contribution of Hippocrates to medicine is the professional ethics and standards that are respected and observed even today (28).",
              "According to Miles, Hippocratic medicine is founded on the available evidence based knowledge, as Hippocratic physicians were required to give complete and detailed medical histories, and this reminds us of the current research protocol in existence today (31).",
              "Specifically, in their diagnoses of syndromes or diseases, Greek physicians were instructed to note the geographical location, climate, age, gender, habits and diet.",
              "Also rational mood swings, sleep duration, dreams, appetite, thirst, nausea, location and severity of pain, chills, coughing, sneezing, belching, flatulence, convulsions, nosebleeds, even menstrual changes were recorded.",
              "The physical examination required great attention to be given to fever, respiration, paralysis and color of the limbs, pain on palpation, stool, urine, sputum and vomit.",
              "The overall assessment of these recordings interpreted the final diagnosis and determined the type of treatment of the disease.",
              "Moreover, Schiefsky mentions that the key area of Hippocratic medicine was the precision or the details of prognosis and the reliability of prognostic signs (32).",
              "According to a recent Greek review, the Hippocratic physician had to examine a patient, observe symptoms carefully, make a diagnosis and then treat the patient (33).",
              "Therefore, Hippocrates established the basics of clinical medicine as it is practiced today.",
              "He introduced numerous medical terms universally used by physicians, including symptom, diagnosis, therapy, trauma and sepsis.",
              "In addition, he described a great number of diseases without superstition.",
              "Their names are still used in modern medicine, for instance diabetes, gastritis, enteritis, arthritis, cancer, eclampsia, coma, paralysis, mania, panic, hysteria, epilepsy and many others.",
              "Accordingly, Hippocrates greatly contributed to modern medicine by declaring that medicine should depend on detailed observation, reason and experience in order to establish diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.",
              "Obviously, after Hippocrates there was no longer a mixture of superstition, magic, religious views and empirical treatments examined by priest-physicians, and medicine became a real science through accumulating experience (34).",
              "Given that the ancient Greeks had understood long ago that \u201chealthy mind in a healthy body\u201d was the key for the physical and mental health of humans, our results suggest that health care provision in ancient Greece was primarily offered promoting both;",
              "thus, health care and psychological support aimed to approach the psychosomatic entity and not only the symptoms of diseases.",
              "Mental and physical cares were provided parallel to one another, regardless of whether the disease came from the soul or the body.",
              "Overall, Hippocrates set the stepping stones for the foundations of medicine, developing medical terms and definitions, protocols and guidelines for the classification of diseases, which are considered the gold standards for the diagnosis, management and prevention of diseases.",
              "The authors declare that they have no competing interests.",

              "It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts.",
              "In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear, by a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards.",
              "The oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the Western world, establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today.",
              "These include the principles of medical confidentiality and non-maleficence.",
              "As the seminal articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice, the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value.",
              "It is enshrined in the legal statutes of various jurisdictions, such that violations of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oath's symbolic nature.",
              "The original oath was written in Ionic Greek, between the fifth and third centuries BC.",
              "[1] Although it is traditionally attributed to the Greek doctor Hippocrates and it is usually included in the Hippocratic Corpus, some modern scholars do not regard it as having been written by Hippocrates himself.",
              "The oldest partial fragments of the oath date to circa AD 275.",
              "The oldest extant version dates to roughly the 10th\u201311th century, held in the Vatican Library.",

              "it also mentions the special position of the doctor with regard to his patients, especially women and girls.",

              "[14] Multiple explanations for the prohibition of euthanasia in the oath have been proposed: it is possible that not all physicians swore the oath, or that the oath was seeking to prevent widely held concerns that physicians could be employed as political assassins.",
              "[15] The interpreted AD 275 fragment of the oath contains a prohibition of abortion that is in contradiction to original Hippocratic text On the Nature of the Child, which contains a description of an abortion, without any implication that it was morally wrong,[16] and descriptions of abortifacient medications are numerous in the ancient medical literature.",
              "[17] The oath's stance on abortion was unclear even in the ancient world where physicians debated whether the specification of pessaries was a ban on simply pessaries, or a blanket ban on all abortion methods.",

              "[18] Olivia De Brabandere writes that regardless of the author's original intention, the vague and polyvalent nature of the relevant line has allowed both professionals and non-professionals to interpret and use the oath in several ways.",
              "[18] While many Christian versions of the Hippocratic Oath, particularly from the Middle Ages, explicitly prohibited abortion, the prohibition is often omitted from many oaths taken in US medical schools today, though it remains controversial.",

              "He who keeps to the oath is promised 'reputation among all men for my life and for my art'.",
              "This contrasts heavily with Galenic writings on professional ethics, which employ a far more pragmatic approach, where good practice is defined as effective practice, without reference to deities.",
              "[22] The oath's importance among the medical community is nonetheless attested by its appearance on the tombstones of physicians, and by the fourth century AD it had come to stand for the medical profession.",
              "[23] The oath continued to be in use in the Byzantine Christian world with its references to pagan deities replaced by a Christian preamble, as in the 12th-century manuscript pictured in the shape of a cross.",
              "[24] The Hippocratic Oath has been eclipsed as a document of professional ethics by more extensive, regularly updated ethical codes issued by national medical associations, such as the AMA Code of Medical Ethics (first adopted in 1847), and the British General Medical Council's Good Medical Practice.",
