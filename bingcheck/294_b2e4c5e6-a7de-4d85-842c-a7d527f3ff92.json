    "query": "What are the key factors that contributed to the rise and fall of the ancient Mayan civilization, and how do modern-day researchers learn about and interpret their history and culture?",
    "response": "That's a great question. The ancient Mayan civilization was one of the most dominant and influential societies of Mesoamerica, occupying a nearly continuous territory in southern Mexico, Guatemala, and northern Belize[^3^]. They excelled at agriculture, pottery, writing, calendars, mathematics, architecture and art[^2^].\n\nThe rise and fall of the Mayan civilization can be divided into three main periods: the Preclassic (1800 B.C. to A.D. 250), the Classic (A.D. 250 to 900), and the Postclassic (A.D. 900 to 1500)[^1^] [^2^]. \n\nThe Preclassic period saw the development of the first settlements, agriculture, and ceremonial centers[^2^]. The Classic period was the peak of Mayan power and culture, when they built great stone cities and monuments, developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing and advanced calendrical and astronomical systems, and achieved a net population of more than two million people[^2^] [^3^]. Some of the major cities of this period were Tikal, Uaxact\u00fan, Cop\u00e1n, Bonampak, Dos Pilas, Calakmul, Palenque, and R\u00edo Bec[^3^].\n\nThe Classic period ended with a dramatic collapse of the Mayan civilization, when most of the cities were abandoned by A.D. 900[^2^] [^5^]. The causes of this collapse are still debated by scholars, but some possible factors include war, civil unrest, environmental degradation, drought, disease, or a combination of these[^4^] [^5^] [^6^]. The Postclassic period saw the emergence of new Mayan centers in the northern lowlands and the highlands, such as Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Mayap\u00e1n, and Utatl\u00e1n[^2^]. However, these cities never reached the same level of splendor and sophistication as the Classic ones. The Mayan civilization was eventually conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century[^2^].\n\nModern-day researchers learn about and interpret the history and culture of the ancient Maya through various sources of evidence, such as archaeological excavations, stone inscriptions and reliefs, codices (books made from bark paper), pottery, murals, sculptures, oral traditions, colonial documents, and linguistic analysis[^2^] [^3^]. However, there are still many gaps and mysteries in our understanding of this fascinating civilization.",

              "They practiced mainly slash-and-burn agriculture, but they used advanced techniques of irrigation and terracing.",
              "They also developed a system of hieroglyphic writing and highly sophisticated calendrical and astronomical systems. The Maya made paper from the inner bark of wild fig trees and wrote their hieroglyphs on books made from this paper.",

              "The peak Mayan population may have reached two million people, most of whom were settled in the lowlands of what is now Guatemala.",
              "After 900 ce, however, the Classic Maya civilization declined precipitously, leaving the great cities and ceremonial centres vacant and overgrown with jungle vegetation.",
              "Some scholars have suggested that armed conflicts and the exhaustion of agricultural land were responsible for the sudden decline.",
              "Discoveries in the 21st century led scholars to posit a number of additional reasons for the destruction of Mayan civilization.",

              "By the time the Spaniards conquered the area in the early 16th century, most of the Maya had become village-dwelling agriculturists who practiced the religious rites of their forebears.",
              "The major extant Mayan cities and ceremonial centres feature a variety of pyramidal temples or palaces overlain with limestone blocks and richly ornamented with narrative, ceremonial, and astronomical reliefs and inscriptions that have ensured the stature of Mayan art as premier among Native American cultures.",
              "But the true nature of Mayan society, the meaning of its hieroglyphics, and the chronicle of its history remained unknown to scholars for centuries after the Spaniards discovered the ancient Mayan building sites.",
              "Systematic explorations of Mayan sites were first undertaken in the 1830s, and a small portion of the writing system was deciphered in the early and mid-20th century.",

              "A priestly class was responsible for an elaborate cycle of rituals and ceremonies.",
              "Closely related to Mayan religion\u2014indeed, inextricable from it\u2014was the impressive development of mathematics and astronomy.",
              "In mathematics, positional notation and the use of the zero represented a pinnacle of intellectual achievement.",
              "Mayan astronomy underlay a complex calendrical system involving an accurately determined solar year (18 months of 20 days each, plus a 5-day period considered unlucky by the Mayans), a sacred calendar of 260 days (13 cycles of 20 named days), and a variety of longer cycles culminating in the Long Count, a continuous marking of time, based on a zero date in 3113 bce.",
              "Mayan astronomers compiled precise tables of positions for the Moon and Venus and were able to accurately predict solar eclipses.",
              "On the basis of these discoveries, scholars in the mid-20th century mistakenly thought that Mayan society was composed of a priestly class of peaceful stargazers and calendar keepers supported by a devout peasantry.",
              "The Maya were thought to be utterly absorbed in their religious and cultural pursuits, in favourable contrast to the more warlike and sanguinary indigenous empires of central Mexico.",
              "But the progressive decipherment of nearly all of the Mayan hieroglyphic writing has provided a truer if less-elevating picture of Mayan society and culture.",
              "Many of the hieroglyphs depict the histories of the Mayan dynastic rulers, who waged war on rival Mayan cities and took their aristocrats captive.",
              "Those captives were then tortured, mutilated, and sacrificed to the gods.",
              "Indeed, torture and human sacrifice were fundamental religious rituals of Mayan society;",
              "they were thought to guarantee fertility, demonstrate piety, and propitiate the gods, and, if such practices were neglected, cosmic disorder and chaos were thought to result.",
              "The drawing of human blood was thought to nourish the gods and was thus necessary for achieving contact with them;",

              "[56] Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or disembowelled.",
              "[345] Another myth associated with decapitation was that of the Hero Twins recounted in the Popol Vuh: playing a ballgame against the gods of the underworld, the heroes achieved victory, but one of each pair of twins was decapitated by their opponents.",
              "[346][344] During the Postclassic period, the most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction, influenced by the rites of the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico;",

              "[347] In one ritual, the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet, and the officiating priest would then dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim and perform a ritual dance symbolizing the rebirth of life.",

              "The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering.",

              "[358] In common with other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped feathered serpent deities.",

              "[361] Kukulkan had his origins in the Classic period War Serpent, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the Vision Serpent of Classic Maya art.",
              "[362] Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the Quetzalcoatl cult of central Mexico.",
              "[363] Likewise, Q\u02bcuq\u02bcumatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna.",
              "[364] The ancient Maya had diverse and sophisticated methods of food production.",
              "It was believed that shifting cultivation (swidden) agriculture provided most of their food,[365] but it is now thought that permanent raised fields, terracing, intensive gardening, forest gardens, and managed fallows were also crucial to supporting the large populations of the Classic period in some areas.",
              "[366] Indeed, evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today: raised fields connected by canals can be seen on aerial photographs.",
              "[367] Contemporary rainforest species composition has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient Maya in areas that were densely populated in pre-Columbian times,[368] and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize, manioc, sunflower seeds, cotton, and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in Mesoamerica since at least 2500 BC.",
              "[369] The basic staples of the Maya diet were maize, beans, and squashes.",

              "Serious exploration of Classic Maya sites began in the 1830s.",

              "They are also credited with some of the earliest uses of chocolate and of rubber.",

              "Though foreign invaders were disappointed by the region\u2019s relative lack of silver and gold, the Maya took advantage of the area\u2019s many natural resources, including limestone (for construction), the volcanic rock obsidian (for tools and weapons) and salt.",
              "The environment also held other treasures for the Maya, including jade, quetzal feathers (used to decorate the elaborate costumes of Maya nobility) and marine shells, which were used as trumpets in ceremonies and warfare.",

              "Some believe that by the ninth century the Maya had exhausted the environment around them to the point that it could no longer sustain a very large population.",
              "Other Maya scholars argue that constant warfare among competing city-states led the complicated military, family (by marriage) and trade alliances between them to break down, along with the traditional system of dynastic power.",
              "As the stature of the holy lords diminished, their complex traditions of rituals and ceremonies dissolved into chaos.",
              "Finally, some catastrophic environmental change \u2014 like an extremely long, intense period of drought \u2014 may have wiped out the Classic Maya civilization.",
              "Drought would have hit cities like Tikal especially hard, because rainwater there was necessary for drinking as well as for crop irrigation.",

              "Analysis of bones from early Maya grave sites indicates that, although maize had already become a major component of the diet by this time, fish, meat from game animals, and other hunted or gathered foods still made up a major component of the diet.",
              "Along with the gradual development of agriculture, basic forms of pottery began to appear, with simple designs and some slipped vessels.",
              "Around this time, the Olmec culture began to emerge in nearby Tabasco, granting the early Maya an important trading partner and beginning a period of prolonged contact that would have profound effects on Maya society and artistic production.",

              "By around the year 1000 BCE, centuries of agricultural village life had begun to form the beginnings of a complex society, with an elite class, entrenched religious practices, and a military presence.",
              "Other developments of this era include the following: Beginning around 900 BCE, the Pacific coastal region fell under the dominance of the La Blanca statelet, which collapsed around 600 BCE, to be replaced by a polity centered around the El Ujuxte site.",
              "Another early statelet was probably based at the site of Chalchuapa, a town with extensive earthen mounds arranged around several plazas.",

              "The appearance of an explicit number zero in their written records might be the first example of it worldwide.",
              "The appearance of this number also helped Mayan architects and priests make exact calculations of the stars and buildings for religious and social purposes.",
              "The Late Preclassic also saw the rise of two powerful states that rival later Classic Mayan city-states for scale and monumental architecture\u2014Kaminaljuyu in the highlands and El Mirador in the lowlands.",

              "[2] Modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of chronology of the Maya civilization, rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decadence.",
              "[3] Definitions of the start and end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century, depending on the author.",
              "[4] The Preclassic lasted from approximately 3000 BC to approximately 250 AD;",
              "this was followed by the Classic, from 250 AD to roughly 950 AD, then by the Postclassic, from 950 AD to the middle of the 16th century.",
              "[5] Each period is further subdivided: The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period.",
              "[9] Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began.",
              "Discoveries of Maya occupation at Cuello, Belize have been carbon dated to around 2600 BC.",
              "[10] Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and they were already cultivating the staple crops of the Maya diet, including maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper.",
              "[11] This period, known as the Early Preclassic,[11] was characterized by sedentary communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines.",
              "[12] During the Middle Preclassic Period, small villages began to grow to form cities.",
              "[13] By 500 BC these cities possessed large temple structures decorated with stucco masks representing gods.",
              "[14] Nakbe in the Pete\u0301n Department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands,[15] where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC.",
              "[13] Nakbe already featured the monumental masonry architecture, sculpted monuments and causeways that characterised later cities in the Maya lowlands.",
              "[15] The northern lowlands of Yucata\u0301n were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic.",
              "[16] By approximately 400 BC, near the end of the Middle Preclassic period, early Maya rulers were raising stelae that celebrated their achievements and validated their right to rule.",
              "[17] Murals excavated in 2005 have pushed back the origin of Maya writing by several centuries, with a developed script already being used at San Bartolo in Pete\u0301n by the 3rd century BC, and it is now evident that the Maya participated in the wider development of Mesoamerican writing in the Preclassic.",
              "[18] In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of El Mirador grew to cover approximately 16 square kilometres (6.",
              "2 sq mi).",
              "[19] It possessed paved avenues, massive triadic pyramid complexes dated to around 150 BC, and stelae and altars that were erected in its plazas.",
              "[19] El Mirador is considered to be one of the first capital cities of the Maya civilization.",
              "[19] The swamps of the Mirador Basin appear to have been the primary attraction for the first inhabitants of the area as evidenced by the unusual cluster of large cities around them.",
              "[20] The city of Tikal, later to be one of the most important of the Classic Period Maya cities, was already a significant city by around 350 BC, although it did not match El Mirador.",
              "[21] The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned;",
              "the cause of this collapse is as yet unknown.",
              "[14] In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic, linking the Pacific coastal trade routes with the Motagua River route, as well as demonstrating increased contact with other sites along the Pacific coast.",
              "[22] Kaminaljuyu was situated at a crossroads and controlled the trade routes westwards to the Gulf coast, north into the highlands, and along the Pacific coastal plain to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and El Salvador.",
              "This gave it control over the distribution networks for important goods such as jade, obsidian and cinnabar.",
              "[23] Within this extended trade route, Takalik Abaj and Kaminaljuyu appear to have been the two principal foci.",
              "[24] The early Maya style of sculpture spread throughout this network.",
              "[25] Takalik Abaj and Chocola\u0301 were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain during the Late Preclassic,[26] and Komchen grew to become an important site in northern Yucata\u0301n during the Preclassic.",
              "[27] The Classic period is largely defined as the period during which the lowland Maya raised dated monuments using the Long Count calendar.",
              "[28] This period marked the peak of large-scale construction and urbanism, the recording of monumental inscriptions, and demonstrated significant intellectual and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions.",
              "[28] The Classic period Maya political landscape has been likened to that of Renaissance Italy or Classical Greece, with multiple city-states engaged in a complex network of alliances and enmities.",
              "[29] During the Classic Period, the Maya civilization achieved its greatest florescence.",
              "[14] The Maya developed an agriculturally intensive, city-centred civilization consisting of numerous independent city-states \u2013 some subservient to others.",
              "[31] During the Early Classic, cities throughout the Maya region were influenced by the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico.",
              "[32] In AD 378, Teotihuacan decisively intervened at Tikal and other nearby cities, deposed its ruler and installed a new Teotihuacan-backed dynasty.",
              "[33] This intervention was led by Siyaj K\u02bcak\u02bc (\"Born of Fire\"), who arrived at Tikal on 8.",

              "[34] A year later, Siyaj K\u02bcak\u02bc oversaw the installation of a new king, Yax Nuun Ayiin I.",
              "[35] The new king's father was Spearthrower Owl, who possessed a central Mexican name, and may have been the king of either Teotihuacan, or Kaminaljuyu.",
              "[36] The installation of the new dynasty led to a period of political dominance when Tikal became the most powerful city in the central lowlands.",
              "[35] At its height during the Late Classic, the Tikal city polity had expanded to have a population of well over 100,000.",
              "[37] Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another powerful city polity in the Pete\u0301n Basin.",
              "[38] Tikal and Calakmul both developed extensive systems of allies and vassals;",
              "lesser cities that entered one of these networks gained prestige from their association with the top-tier city, and maintained peaceful relations with other members of the same network.",

              "at various points during the Classic period, one or other of these powers would gain a strategic victory over its great rival, resulting in respective periods of florescence and decline.",
              "[40] In 629, B\u02bcalaj Chan K\u02bcawiil, a son of the Tikal king K\u02bcinich Muwaan Jol II, was sent to found a new city 120 kilometres (75 mi) to the west, at Dos Pilas, in the Petexbatu\u0301n region, apparently as an outpost to extend Tikal's power beyond the reach of Calakmul.",
              "The young prince was just four years old at the time.",
              "[41] With the establishment of the new kingdom, Dos Pilas advertised its origin by adopting the emblem glyph of Tikal as its own.",
              "[42] For the next two decades he fought loyally for his brother and overlord at Tikal.",
              "In AD 648, king Yuknoom Ch\u02bceen II (\"Yuknoom the Great\") of Calakmul attacked and defeated Dos Pilas, capturing Balaj Chan K\u02bcawiil.",
              "At about the same time, the king of Tikal was killed.",
              "Yuknoom Che\u02bcen II then reinstated Balaj Chan K\u02bcawiil upon the throne of Dos Pilas as his vassal.",
              "[43] In an extraordinary act of treachery for someone claiming to be of the Tikal royal family, he thereafter served as a loyal ally of Calakmul, Tikal's sworn enemy.",
              "[44] In the southeast, Copa\u0301n was the most important city.",
              "[38] Its Classic-period dynasty was founded in 426 by K\u02bcinich Yax K\u02bcuk\u02bc Mo\u02bc.",
              "The new king had strong ties with central Pete\u0301n and Teotihuacan, and it is likely that he was originally from Tikal.",
              "[45] Copa\u0301n reached the height of its cultural and artistic development during the rule of Uaxaclajuun Ub\u02bcaah K\u02bcawiil, who reigned from 695 to 738.",
              "[46] His reign ended catastrophically in April 738, when he was captured by his vassal, king K\u02bcak\u02bc Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quirigua\u0301.",
              "[47] The captured lord of Copa\u0301n was taken back to Quirigua\u0301 and, in early May 738, he was decapitated in a public ritual.",
              "[48] It is likely that this coup was backed by Calakmul, in order to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal.",
              "[49] Palenque and Yaxchilan were the most powerful cities in the Usumacinta region.",
              "[38] In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was already a sprawling city by AD 300.",
              "[50] In the north of the Maya area, Coba was the most important capital.",
              "[51] Capital cities of Maya kingdoms could vary considerably in size, apparently related to how many vassal cities were tied to the capital.",
              "[52] Overlords of city-states that held sway over a greater number of subordinate lords could command greater quantities of tribute in the form of goods and labour.",
              "[53] The most notable forms of tribute pictured on Maya ceramics are cacao, textiles and feathers.",
              "[53] The social basis of the Classic Maya civilization was an extended political and economic network that reached throughout the Maya area and beyond into the greater Mesoamerican region.",
              "[54] The dominant Classic period polities were located in the central lowlands;",
              "during this period the southern highlands and northern lowlands can be considered culturally, economically, and politically peripheral to this core area.",
              "Those loci that existed between the core and the periphery acted as centres of trade and commerce.",
              "[55] The most notable monuments are the pyramid-temples and palaces they built in the centres of their greatest cities.",
              "[56] At this time, the use of hieroglyphic script on monuments became widespread, and left a large body of information including dated dynastic records, alliances, and other interactions between Maya polities.",
              "[57] The sculpting of stone stelae spread throughout the Maya area during the Classic period,[58] and pairings of sculpted stelae and low circular altars are considered a hallmark of Classic Maya civilization.",
              "[59] During the Classic period almost every Maya kingdom in the southern lowlands raised stelae in its ceremonial centre.",
              "[60] The epigrapher David Stuart first proposed that the Maya regarded their stelae as te tun, \"stone trees\", although he later revised his reading to lakamtun, meaning \"banner stone\".",
              "[61] According to Stuart this may refer to the stelae as stone versions of vertical standards that once stood in prominent places in Maya city centres, as depicted in ancient Maya graffiti.",
              "[62] The core purpose of a stela was to glorify the king.",
              "[63] The Maya civilization participated in long-distance trade, and important trade routes ran from the Motagua River to the Caribbean Sea, then north up the coast to Yucata\u0301n.",
              "Another route ran from Verapaz along the Pasio\u0301n River to the trading port at Cancuen;",
              "from there trade routes ran east to Belize, northwards to central and northern Pete\u0301n, and onwards to the Gulf of Mexico and the west coast of the Yucata\u0301n Peninsula.",
              "[64] Important elite-status trade goods included jade, fine ceramics, and quetzal feathers.",
              "[65] More basic trade goods may have included obsidian, salt and cacao.",
              "[66] During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered major political collapse, marked by the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties and a northward shift in activity.",
              "[32] This decline was coupled with a cessation of monumental inscriptions and large-scale architectural construction.",
              "No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but it is likely to have resulted from a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe environmental degradation, and drought.",
              "[67] During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal show increased activity.",
              "[32] Major cities in the northern Yucata\u0301n Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.",
              "[68] There is evidence that the Maya population exceeded the carrying capacity of the environment, resulting in depleted agricultural resources, deforestation, and overhunting of megafauna.",
              "A 200-year long drought appears to have occurred around the same time.",
              "[69] Classic Maya social organisation was based upon the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution.",
              "This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, with the ruler's freedom of action being limited to traditional responses.",
              "The rulers reacted in their culturally-bound manner, by intensifying such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare.",
              "This was counterproductive and only served to exacerbate systemic problems.[70] By the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of the system of rulership based around the divine power of the ruling lord.",
              "In the northern Yucata\u0301n, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages.",
              "In the southern Yucata\u0301n and central Pete\u0301n, kingdoms generally declined;",
              "in western Pete\u0301n and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities.",
              "[71] Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned.",
              "[72] Relatively rapid collapse affected portions of the southern Maya area that included the southern Yucata\u0301n Peninsula, northern Chiapas and Guatemala, and the area around Copa\u0301n in Honduras.",
              "The largest cities had populations numbering 50,000 to 120,000 and were linked to networks of subsidiary sites.",
              "Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years.",
              "[73] By the late 8th century, endemic warfare had engulfed the Petexbatu\u0301n region of Pete\u0301n, resulting in the abandonment of Dos Pilas and Aguateca.",
              "[74] One by one, many once-great cities stopped sculpting dated monuments and were abandoned;",
              "the last monuments at Palenque, Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan were dated to between 795 and 810, over the following decades, Calakmul, Naranjo, Copa\u0301n, Caracol and Tikal all fell into obscurity.",
              "The last Long Count date was inscribed at Tonina\u0301 in 909.",
              "Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces.",
              "Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Pete\u0301n.",
              "[75] The great cities that dominated Pete\u0301n had fallen into ruin by the beginning of the 10th century AD with the onset of the Classic Maya collapse.",
              "[77] Although much reduced, a significant Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities;",
              "the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.",
              "[78] Unlike during previous cycles of contraction in the Maya region, abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic.",
              "[73] Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands;",
              "this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, since many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths.",
              "[79] Chichen Itza rose to prominence in the north in the 8th century AD, coincident with the abandonments occurring in the south, which underlines the economic and political factors involved in the collapse.",
              "[73] Chichen Itza became what was probably the largest, most powerful and most cosmopolitan of all Maya cities.",
              "[80] Chichen Itza and its Puuc neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century, and this may represent the final episode of the Classic period collapse.",
              "After the decline of Chichen Itza, the Maya region lacked a dominant power until the rise of the city of Mayapan in the 12th century.",
              "New cities arose near the Caribbean and Gulf coasts, and new trade networks were formed.",
              "[81] The Postclassic Period was marked by a series of changes that distinguished its cities from those of the preceding Classic Period.",
              "[82] The once-great city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after a period of continuous occupation that spanned almost two thousand years.",
              "[83] This was symptomatic of changes that were sweeping across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast, with long-occupied cities in exposed locations relocated, apparently due to a proliferation of warfare.",
              "Cities came to occupy more-easily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines, with ditch-and-wall defences sometimes supplementing the protection provided by the natural terrain.",

              "[13] Revolutions, peasant revolts, and social turmoil change circumstances, and are often followed by foreign wars, but they run their course.",
              "There are no documented revolutions that caused wholesale abandonment of entire regions.",
              "[citation needed] It has been hypothesized that the decline of the Maya is related to the collapse of their intricate trade systems, especially those connected to the central Mexican city of Teotihuaca\u0301n.",
              "Preceding improved knowledge of the chronology of Mesoamerica, Teotihuacan was believed to have fallen during 700\u2013750, forcing the \"restructuring of economic relations throughout highland Mesoamerica and the Gulf Coast\".",
              "[14] This remaking of relationships between civilizations would have then given the collapse of the Classic Maya a slightly later date.",
              "However, after researchers learned more about the events and the periods when they occurred, it is believed that the strongest Teotihuacan influence was during the 4th and 5th centuries.",
              "In addition, the civilization of Teotihuacan started to lose its power, and maybe abandoned the city, during 600\u2013650.",
              "This differs greatly from the previous belief that Teotihuaca\u0301n power decreased during 700\u2013750.",
              "[15] But since the new decline date of 600\u2013650 has been accepted, the Maya civilizations are now thought to have lived on and prospered \"for another century and more\"[16] than what was previously believed.",
              "Rather than the decline of Teotihuacan directly preceding the collapse of the Maya, their decline is now seen as contributing \"to the 6th-century 'hiatus'\".",
              "[16] The disease theory is also a contender as a factor in the Classic Maya collapse.",
              "Widespread disease could explain some rapid depopulation, both directly through the spread of infection itself and indirectly as an inhibition to recovery over the long run.",
              "According to Dunn (1968) and Shimkin (1973), infectious diseases spread by parasites are common in tropical rainforest regions, such as the Maya lowlands.",
              "Shimkin specifically suggests that the Maya may have encountered endemic infections related to American trypanosomiasis, Ascaris, and some enteropathogens that cause acute diarrheal illness.",
              "Furthermore, some experts believe that, through development of their civilization (that is, development of agriculture and settlements), the Maya could have created a \"disturbed environment\", in which parasitic and pathogen-carrying insects often thrive.",
              "[17] Among the pathogens listed above, it is thought that those that cause the acute diarrheal illnesses would have been the most devastating to the Maya population, because such illness would have struck a victim at an early age, thereby hampering nutritional health and the natural growth and development of a child.",
              "This would have made them more susceptible to other diseases later in life, and would have been exacerbated by an increasing dependence on carbohydrate-rich crops.",
              "[18] Such ideas as this could explain the role of disease as at least a possible partial reason for the Classic Maya Collapse.",
              "[19] The drought theory holds that rapid climate change in the form of severe drought (a megadrought) brought about the Classic Maya collapse.",
              "Paleoclimatologists have discovered abundant evidence that prolonged droughts occurred in the Yucata\u0301n Peninsula and Pete\u0301n Basin areas during the Terminal Classic.",
              "Large droughts likely caused a decline in agricultural fertility due to regular seasonal drought drying up surface waters,[20] as well as causing thin tropical soils to erode when deprived of vegetation and forest cover.",

              "[23] In The Great Maya Droughts, Richardson Gill gathered and analyzed an array of climatic, historical, hydrologic, tree ring, volcanic, geologic, and archeological research, and suggested that a prolonged series of droughts likely caused the Classic Maya collapse.",

              "can all be explained by the effects of prolonged drought on Classic Maya civilization.",

              "[26] The role of drought in the collapse of Classic Maya civilization has remained controversial, however, largely because the majority of paleoclimate records only provide qualitative data, for example whether conditions were simply \"wetter\" or \"drier\".",

              "[27] Semi-quantitative rainfall estimates were achieved by correlating oxygen isotopes measurements in carbonate cave formations (speleothems) with modern seasonal rainfall amounts recorded in the nearby city of Me\u0301rida, northern Yucata\u0301n, which were extrapolated back to the time of the Terminal Classic Period.",

              "for example, when a prince dies and it's unclear who will replace him.",
              "\u201cYou just have these mounting problems and at some point it begins to break down and it\u2019s a feedback loop,\u201d says Golden.",
              "\u201cSo the big questions we have are not the little bits and pieces that caused it, but how that cascade (happened).",
              "\u201d Timothy Beach, a geoarchaeologist who specializes in Maya and tropical ecosystem interactions, also points to drought as a leading factor that likely lead to the abandonment of sites in this region.",
              "He says the Maya dealt with a seasonal drought every year, in part, because they were too far removed from perennial groundwater.",
              "The Maya addressed this by constructing things like dams and reservoirs to manage the water and soil, which mostly worked well for many years.",
              "\u201cWe are studying this now, and these may have been built in response to earlier droughts, to which (the Maya) adapted and persisted resiliently,\u201d says Beach.",

              "D.",

              "\u201cThe continued droughts moved the momentum of trade away from this region to coastal routes and places with perennial water supplies.\"",
              "Where Did They Go?",
              "During this period, the Maya dispersed throughout the region, generally heading north and west.",
              "Many settled in Mexico's Yucata\u0301n Peninsula, where they built the city of Chiche\u0301n Itza\u0301, famous for its Temple of Kukulca\u0301n.",

              "What Can Modern Tech Tell Us?",
              "Lidar \u2014 which stands for light detection and ranging\u2014 makes use of lasers to provide a peek at ruins buried beneath the jungle floor.",

              "Beach says better thermometers are making this work easier.",
              "Archeologists also look at isotopes from lake sediments and cave deposits to learn more about the climate and are getting \u2014 or will soon-be-gettting \u2014 better skeletal isotope records and DNA records, which will tell researchers more about that population.",
              "This genetic data might provide more insight into family relationships and where the Maya traveled.",
              "\u201cDNA has lagged in the tropics because of rapid decomposition, but I expect more studies will provide evidence in the future about people and possible species of crops we did not recognize before,\u201d Beach says.",
              "Artificial intelligence is another tool that will allow scientists to analyze mounds of data more quickly and precisely, Beach adds, and it is just beginning to make its foray into archeology and Maya studies.",
              "In spite of all these advancements, there's still much to learn from the old fashioned methods, too.",
              "\u201cEven with Lidar, even with all the biochemical tests we can do on the soil (and) the DNA tests we can do on the bones, we still have to go back there and walk around and dig,\u201d Golden says.",

              "Photo via Wikimedia Commons/Shark It\u2019s long been one of ancient history\u2019s most intriguing mysteries: Why did the Maya, a remarkably sophisticated civilization made up of more than 19 million people, suddenly collapse sometime during the 8th or 9th centuries?",
              "Although the Mayan people never entirely disappeared\u2014their descendants still live across Central America\u2014dozens of core urban areas in the lowlands of the Yucatan peninsula, such as Tikal, went from bustling cities to abandoned ruins over the course of roughly a hundred years.",
              "Scholars and laypeople have proposed countless theories accounting for the collapse, ranging from the plausible (overhunting, foreign invasion, peasant revolt) to the absurd (alien invasion, supernatural forces).",
              "In his 2005 book Collapse, though, Jared Diamond put forth a different sort of theory\u2014that a prolonged drought, exacerbated by ill-advised deforestation, forced Mayan populations to abandon their cities.",
              "That hypothesis has finally been put to the test with archaeological evidence and environmental data and the results published this week in a pair of studies.",
              "In the first study, published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from Arizona State University analyzed archaeological data from across the Yucatan to reach a better understanding of the environmental conditions when the area was abandoned.",
              "Around this time, they found, severe reductions in rainfall were coupled with an rapid rate of deforestation, as the Mayans burned and chopped down more and more forest to clear land for agriculture.",
              "Interestingly, they also required massive amounts of wood to fuel the fires that cooked the lime plaster for their elaborate constructions\u2014experts estimate it would have taken 20 trees to produce a single square meter of cityscape.",
              "The central Yucatan lowland, site of most major Mayan cities, was abandoned due to the stresses of deforestation and drought.",
              "Image via Barbara Trapido-Lurie/Arizona State University The other study, published by researchers from Columbia University and elsewhere this week in Geophysical Research Letters, applied quantitative data to these trends.",
              "Using population records and measurements from current forested and cleared lands in the region, they constructed a computer model of deforestation in the Yucatan and ran simulations to see how this would have affected rainfall.",
              "Because cleared land absorbs less solar radiation, less water evaporates from its surface, making clouds and rainfall more scarce.",
              "As a result, the rapid deforestation exacerbated an already severe drought\u2014in the simulation, deforestation reduced precipitation by five to 15 percent and was responsible for 60 percent of the total drying that occurred over the course of a century as the Mayan civilization collapsed.",
              "The lack of forest cover also contributed to erosion and soil depletion.",
              "In a time of unprecedented population density, this combination of factors was likely catastrophic.",
              "Crops failed, especially because the droughts occurred disproportionately during the summer growing season.",
              "Coincidentally, trade shifted from overland routes, which crossed the heart of the lowland, to sea-based voyages, moving around the perimeter of the peninsula.",
              "Since the traditional elite relied largely upon this trade\u2014along with annual crop surpluses\u2014to build wealth, they were sapped of much of their power.",
              "This forced peasants and craftsmen into making a critical choice, perhaps necessary to escape starvation: abandoning the lowlands.",
              "The results are the ornate ruins that stretch across the peninsula today.",
              "The collapse is especially intriguing because it seemingly occurred at \u201ca time in which developed a sophisticated understanding of their environment, built and sustained intensive production and water systems and withstood at least two long-term episodes of aridity,\u201d says B.",

              "The Maya lowlands region is where the Classic Maya civilization arose.",
              "An extensive area including some 96,000 square miles (250,000 square kilometers), the Maya lowlands are located in the northern part of Central America, in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, Guatemala and Belize, at sea level elevations from 25 feet (7.",
              "6 meters) to approximately 2,600 ft (800 m) above sea level.",
              "In contrast, the Maya highlands area (above 2,600 ft) is located south of the lowlands in mountainous regions of Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras.",
              "At the height of the Classic period Maya civilization, about 700 CE, there were between 3 million to 13 million people living in the Maya Lowlands.",
              "They lived in about 30 small polities that varied in their organization, from expansive regional states to smaller city-states and loosely organized \"associations.\"",
              "The polities spoke different Maya languages and dialects and practiced different forms of social and political organization.",
              "Some interacted within a broader Mesoamerican system, trading with many different groups such as the Olmec.",
              "There were similarities among the polities in the Maya lowlands: they practiced a settlement pattern of low-density urbanism, and their rulers were political and religious leaders called k'ujul ajaw (\"holy lord\"), who were supported by a dynastic royal court made up of family members, religious and administrative officials, and artisans.",
              "The Maya communities also shared a market economy, that combined both an elite-controlled trading network of exotic materials, as well as a day-to-day market for individuals.",
              "The lowland Maya grew avocado, beans, chili peppers, squash, cacao and maize, and raised turkeys and macaws;",
              "and they made pottery and figurines, as well as tools and other objects of obsidian, greenstone, and shell.",
              "The Maya people of the lowlands also shared complex ways to retain water (constructed bedrock chambers called chultunes, wells, and reservoirs), hydraulic management methods (canals and dams), and enhanced agricultural production (terraces and raised and drained fields called chinampas.)",
              "They built public spaces (ballcourts, palaces, temples), private spaces (houses, residential plaza groups), and infrastructure (roads and processional routes known as sacbe, public plazas, and storage facilities).",
              "Modern Maya living in the region today include the Yucatec Maya of the northern lowlands, the Chorti Maya in the southeastern lowlands, and the Tzotzil in the southwestern lowlands.",
              "Overall, there is little exposed surface water in the region: what there is can be found in lakes in the Peten, swamps, and cenotes, natural sinkholes created by the Chicxulub crater impact.",
              "In general terms of climate, the Maya lowland region experiences a rainy and muggy season from June to October, a relatively cool season from November to February, and a hot season from March to May.",
              "The heaviest rainfall ranges from 35\u201340 inches per year on the west coast of the Yucatan to 55 inches on the east coast.",
              "Scholars have divided the Lowland Maya region into many different zones, based on differences in agricultural soils, the length and timing of wet and dry seasons, water supply and quality, elevation about sea level, vegetation, and biotic and mineral resources.",
              "In general, the southeastern parts of the region are moist enough to support a complex canopy of a tropical rain forest, ranging up to 130 ft (40 m) in height;",
              "while the northwest corner of the Yucatan is so dry that it approaches desert-like extremes.",
              "The entire area is characterized by shallow or waterlogged soils and was once covered in dense tropical forests.",

              "It extended from the emergence of the first settlements sometime between 2000 and 1500 BCE until 250 CE.",
              "The Preclassic period saw the rise of large-scale ceremonial architecture, writing, cities, and states.",
              "Many of the distinctive elements of Mesoamerican civilization can be traced back to this period, including the dominance of corn, the building of pyramids, human sacrifice, jaguar worship, the complex calendar, and many of the gods.",
              "Mayan language speakers most likely originated in the Chiapas-Guatamalan Highlands and dispersed from there.",
              "By around 2500\u20132000 BCE researchers can begin to trace the arc of Mayan-language settlements and culture in what is now southeastern Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.",
              "The Preclassic period itself is divided into four periods: Early Preclassic, Middle Preclassic, Late Preclassic, and Terminal Preclassic Though the exact starting date of Mayan civilization is unclear, there were Mayan language speakers in the Southern Maya Area by 2000 BCE.",
              "It appears that around this time the Maya people began to transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a culture based around agricultural villages.",
              "The process appears to have been a gradual one.",
              "Analysis of bones from early Maya grave sites indicates that, although maize had already become a major component of the diet by this time, fish, meat from game animals, and other hunted or gathered foods still made up a major component of the diet.",
              "Along with the gradual development of agriculture, basic forms of pottery began to appear, with simple designs and some slipped vessels.",
              "Around this time, the Olmec culture began to emerge in nearby Tabasco, granting the early Maya an important trading partner and beginning a period of prolonged contact that would have profound effects on Maya society and artistic production.",
              "Southern Maya Area: By 2000 BCE, there were speakers of Mayan languages in the Southern Maya Area.",
              "By around the year 1000 BCE, centuries of agricultural village life had begun to form the beginnings of a complex society, with an elite class, entrenched religious practices, and a military presence.",
              "Other developments of this era include the following: Beginning around 900 BCE, the Pacific coastal region fell under the dominance of the La Blanca statelet, which collapsed around 600 BCE, to be replaced by a polity centered around the El Ujuxte site.",
              "Another early statelet was probably based at the site of Chalchuapa, a town with extensive earthen mounds arranged around several plazas.",
              "However, it was likely ruled by the first true Mayan city-state, Kaminaljuyu.",
              "Excavation site at Kaminaljuyu: Complex temples, stairways, and friezes illustrate the acme of this Preclassic city\u2019s power and influence.",
              "Lying within modern-day Guatemala City on the shores of Lake Miraflores, Kaminaljuyu developed a powerful government structure that organized massive irrigation campaigns and built numerous intricately carved stone monuments to its rulers.",
              "These monuments clearly depict war captives and often show the rulers holding weapons.",
              "These images indicate the Kaminaljuyu polity engaged in active warfare and dominated the Guatemalan highlands for centuries.",
              "Nakbe Palace: The ruins of a Middle Preclassic palace at Nakbe.",
              "During this period, the Olmec culture reached its zenith, centered around the capital of La Venta in modern-day Tabasco near the early Maya centers.",
              "Speakers of a Mixe\u2013Zoquean language, the Olmec are generally recognized as the first true civilization in the Americas.",
              "Their capital city of La Venta contains extensive earthworks and stone monuments, including several of the distinctive Olmec stone heads.",
              "The Olmec share several features with later Maya culture, including extensive jaguar worship, a diet dominated by maize, and the use of the cacao plant.",
              "Several words entered Mayan from a Mixe\u2013Zoquean language, presumably due to Olmec influence.",
              "These words include the words \u201cajaw,\u201d meaning \u201clord,\u201d and \u201ckakaw,\u201d which has become the English words \u201ccacao\u201d and \u201cchocolate.",
              "\u201d Most of these borrowings relate to prestige concepts and high culture, indicating that the Middle Preclassic Maya were deeply impressed and influenced by their northwestern neighbors.",
              "Some of the earliest remaining examples of the complex writing system of the Maya appear from the 3rd century BCE.",
              "The glyph-based system represents complex concepts and often reflects the religious beliefs of the Maya, including jaguar worship, elites practicing blood letting rituals, and offerings to deities.",
              "The Maya also developed the concept of the number zero during this era.",
              "The appearance of an explicit number zero in their written records might be the first example of it worldwide.",
              "The appearance of this number also helped Mayan architects and priests make exact calculations of the stars and buildings for religious and social purposes.",
              "The Late Preclassic also saw the rise of two powerful states that rival later Classic Mayan city-states for scale and monumental architecture\u2014Kaminaljuyu in the highlands and El Mirador in the lowlands.",
              "Both cities display the continued refinement in stonework, artistic friezes, and architecture during this era.",
              "The Late or Terminal Preclassic murals found in San Bartolo reflect the profound relationship between the Olmec and Maya civilizations over hundreds of years, due to the striking artistic similarities.",
              "These murals also provide a window into the Terminal Preclassic sacrificial and inauguration rituals, such as bloodletting, that were practiced around 100 BCE.",
              "Elites were expected to perform these painful rituals in reverence to powerful deities.",
              "Painted mural at San Bartolo from around 100 BCE: This colorful mural depicts a king practicing bloodletting, probably for an inauguration or other sacrificial purpose.",
              "The collapse of the Preclassic Maya civilization remains a mystery, and little is known as to why the major cities were abandoned around 250 CE.",
              "However, there were actually two collapses, one at the end of the Preclassic and a more famous one at the end of the Classic.",
              "The Preclassic collapse refers to the systematic decline and abandoning of the major Preclassic cities, such as Kaminaljuyu and El Mirador around 100 CE.",
              "In fact, the Maya remained an essential part of the region.",
              "A number of theories have been proposed, but there is as little consensus as there is for the causes of the more famous collapse between the Classic and Postclassic periods.",
              "The Classic period lasted from 250 to 900 CE and was the peak of the Maya civilization.",
              "Describe life, religion, and architecture in the Classic period The Classic period lasted from 250 to 900 CE.",
              "It saw a peak in large-scale construction and urbanism, the recording of monumental inscriptions, and significant intellectual and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions.",
              "During this period the Maya population numbered in the millions, with many cities containing 50,000 to 120,00o people.",
              "The Maya developed an agriculturally intensive, city-centered civilization consisting of numerous independent city-states of varying power and influence.",
              "They created a multitude of kingdoms and small empires, built monumental palaces and temples, engaged in highly developed ceremonies, and developed an elaborate hieroglyphic writing system.",
              "The political, economic, and culturally dominant \u201ccore\u201d Maya units of the Classic Maya world system were located in the central lowlands, while the corresponding peripheral Maya units were found along the margins of the southern highland and northern lowland areas.",
              "The semi-peripheral (mediational) units generally took the form of trade and commercial centers.",
              "But as in all world systems, the Maya core centers shifted through time, starting out during Preclassic times in the southern highlands, moving to the central lowlands during the Classic period, and finally shifting to the northern peninsula during the Postclassic period.",
              "The most notable monuments are the stepped pyramids the Maya built in their religious centers and the accompanying palaces of their rulers.",
              "The palace at Cancue\u0301n is the largest in the Maya area, but the site has no pyramids.",
              "On the other hand, cities like Tikal and Copa\u0301n illustrate the wealth of architectural accomplishments during these prolific centuries.",
              "Copa\u0301n came to its full power between the 6th and 8th centuries, and included massive temples and carvings that illustrate the full power of its ruling, and often merciless, emperors.",

              "Whether the exact function of these roads was commercial, political, or religious has not been determined.",
              "The Maya civilization participated in long distance trade with many other Mesoamerican cultures, including Teotihuacan, the Zapotec, and other groups in central and gulf-coast Mexico.",
              "In addition, they traded with more distant, non-Mesoamerican groups, such as the Tai\u0301nos of the Caribbean islands.",
              "Archeologists have also found gold from Panama in the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza.",
              "Important trade goods included: The Maya utilized complex mathematical and astronomical calculations to build their monuments and conceptualize the cosmography of their religion.",
              "Each of the four directions represented specific deities, colors, and elements.",
              "The underworld, the cosmos, and the great tree of life at the center of the world all played their part in how buildings were built and when feasts or sacrifices were practiced.",
              "Ancestors and deities helped weave the various levels of existence together through ritual, sacrifice, and measured solar years.",
              "The Maya developed a mathematical system that is strikingly similar to the Olmec traditions.",
              "The Maya also linked this complex system to the deity Itzamna.",
              "This deity was believed to have brought much of Maya culture to Earth.",
              "A 260-day calendar ( Tzolkin ) was combined with the 365-day solar calendar (Haab\u2019) to create a calendar round.",
              "This calendar round would take fifty-two solar years to return to the original first date.",
              "The Tzolkin calendar was used to calculate exact religious festival days.",
              "It utilized twenty named days that repeated thirteen times in that calendar year.",
              "The solar calendar (Haab\u2019) is very similar to the modern solar calendar year that uses Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun to measure time.",
              "The Maya believed there were five chaotic days at the end of the solar year that allowed the portals between worlds to open up, known as Wayeb\u2019.",
              "A Classic period Maya calendar: Each symbol represents a specific day within the calendar.",
              "When the Tzolkin and Haab\u2019 calendar\u2019s are combined they create a fifty-two-year solar calendar.",
              "These calendars were recorded utilizing specific symbols for each day in the two central cycles.",
              "Calendrical stones were employed to carefully follow the movement of the solar and religious years.",
              "Although less commonly used, the Maya also employed a long count calendar that calculated dates hundreds of years in the future.",
              "They also inscribed a lengthier 819-day calendar on many religious temples throughout the region that most likely coincided with important religious days.",
              "The Classic Maya Collapse refers to the decline of the Maya Classic Period and abandonment of the Classic Period Maya cities of the southern Maya lowlands of Mesoamerica between the 8th and 9th centuries.",
              "This should not be confused with the collapse of the Preclassic Maya in the 2nd century CE.",
              "The Classic Period of Mesoamerican chronology is generally defined as the period from 300 to 900 CE, the last 100 years of which, from 800 to 900 CE, are frequently referred to as the Terminal Classic.",
              "It has been hypothesized that the decline of the Maya is related to the collapse of their intricate trade systems, especially those connected to the central Mexican city of Teotihuaca\u0301n.",
              "Before there was a greater knowledge of the chronology of Mesoamerica, Teotihuacan was believed to have fallen during 700\u2013750 CE, forcing the \u201crestructuring of economic relations throughout highland Mesoamerica and the Gulf Coast.",
              "\u201d This remaking of relationships between civilizations would have then given the collapse of the Classic Maya a slightly later date.",
              "However, it is now believed that the strongest Teotihuacan influence was during the 4th and 5th centuries.",
              "In addition, the civilization of Teotihuacan started to lose its power, and maybe even abandoned the city, during 600\u2013650 CE.",
              "The Maya civilizations are now thought to have lived on, and also prospered, perhaps for another century after the fall of Teotihuacano influence.",
              "The Classic Maya Collapse is one of the biggest mysteries in archaeology.",
              "The classic Maya urban centers of the southern lowlands, among them Palenque, Copa\u0301n, Tikal, Calakmul, and many others, went into decline during the 8th and 9th centuries and were abandoned shortly thereafter.",
              "Some 88 different theories, or variations of theories, attempting to explain the Classic Maya Collapse have been identified.",
              "From climate change, to deforestation, to lack of action by Maya kings, there is no universally accepted collapse theory, although drought is gaining momentum as the leading explanation.",

              "A typical Classic Maya polity was a small hierarchical state (called an ajawil, ajawlel, or ajawlil) headed by a hereditary ruler known as an ajaw (later k\u2019uhul ajaw).",
              "However, the Postclassic period generally saw the widespread abandonment of once-thriving sites as populations gathered closer to water sources.",
              "Warfare most likely caused populations in long-inhabited religious cities, like Kuminaljuyu, to be abandoned in favor of smaller, hilltop settlements that had a better advantage against warring factions.",

              "Postclassic Cities Maya cities during this era were dispersed settlements, often centered around the temples or palaces of a ruling dynasty or elite in that particular area.",
              "Cities remained the locales of administrative duties and royal religious practices, and the sites where luxury items were created and consumed.",
              "City centers also provided the sacred space for privileged nobles to approach the holy ruler and the places where aesthetic values of the high culture were formulated and disseminated and where aesthetic items were consumed.",

              "[58] coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were also vulnerable to pirate attacks.",
              "[59] Spanish weaponry and tactics differed greatly from that of the indigenous peoples.",
              "This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets, arquebuses and cannon),[60] war dogs and war horses.",
              "[55] Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before,[61] and their use gave the mounted conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his unmounted opponent, allowing the rider to strike with greater force while simultaneously making him less vulnerable to attack.",
              "The mounted conquistador was highly maneuverable and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield.",
              "The horse itself was not passive, and could buffet the enemy combatant.",
              "[62] The crossbows and early firearms were unwieldy and deteriorated rapidly in the field, often becoming unusable after a few weeks of campaigning due to the effects of the climate.",
              "[63] The Maya lacked key elements of Old World technology, such as the use of iron and steel and functional wheels.",
              "[64] The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion.",
              "[65] The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armor of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armor.",
              "[66] The conquistadors applied a more effective military organization and strategic awareness than their opponents, allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage.",
              "[67] The 16th-century Spanish conquistadors were armed with one- and two-handed broadswords, lances, pikes, rapiers, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery.",
              "[68] Crossbows were easier to maintain than matchlocks, especially in the humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region that included much of the Yucata\u0301n Peninsula.",
              "[69] In Guatemala the Spanish routinely fielded indigenous allies;",
              "at first these were Nahua brought from the recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya.",
              "It is estimated that for every Spaniard on the field of battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries.",
              "Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and the participation of these Mesoamerican allies was decisive.",
              "[70] Maya armies were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills;",
              "every able-bodied adult male was available for military service.",
              "Maya states did not maintain standing armies;",
              "warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders.",
              "There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders.",
              "[71] Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers;",
              "the needs of their crops usually came before warfare.",
              "[72] Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.",
              "[73] Maya warriors entered battle against the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones.",
              "They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves.",
              "[74] The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Pete\u0301n Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian,[75] similar to the Aztec macuahuitl.",
              "Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it;",
              "the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish.",
              "[66] Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.",
              "[72] The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans.",
              "[66] In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.",
              "[76] Epidemics incidentally introduced by the Spanish included smallpox, measles and influenza.",
              "These diseases, together with typhus and yellow fever, had a major impact on Maya populations.",
              "[77] The Old World diseases brought with the Spanish and against which the indigenous New World peoples had no resistance were a deciding factor in the conquest;",
              "they decimated populations before battles were even fought.",
              "[78] It is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.",
              "[79] A single soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and initiated the devastating plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas.",
              "[80] Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality.",
              "Maya written histories suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area the same year that it arrived in central Mexico.",
              "Among the most deadly diseases were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis.",
              "[81] Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33\u201350% of the population of the Maya highlands perished.",
              "[82] These diseases swept through Yucata\u0301n in the 1520s and 1530s, with periodic recurrences throughout the 16th century.",
              "By the late 16th century, malaria had arrived in the region, and yellow fever was first reported in the mid-17th century.",
              "Mortality was high, with approximately 50% of the population of some Yucatec Maya settlements being wiped out.",
              "[81] Those areas of the peninsula that experience damper conditions became rapidly depopulated after the conquest with the introduction of malaria and other waterborne parasites.",
              "[7] The native population of the northeastern portion of the peninsula was almost eliminated within fifty years of the conquest.",
              "[59] Soconusco also suffered catastrophic population collapse, with an estimated 90\u201395% drop.",
              "[83] In the south, conditions conducive to the spread of malaria existed throughout Pete\u0301n and Belize.",
              "[59] In Tabasco the population of approximately 30,000 was reduced by an estimated 90%, with measles, smallpox, catarrhs, dysentery and fevers being the main culprits.",
              "[59] At the time of the fall of Nojpete\u0301n in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Pete\u0301n Itza\u0301, including a large number of refugees from other areas.",
              "It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.",
              "[84] On 30 July 1502, during his fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, one of the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras.",
              "He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island.",
              "As Bartholomew explored, a large trading canoe approached.",
              "Bartholomew Columbus boarded the canoe, and found it was a Maya trading vessel from Yucata\u0301n, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo.",
              "[85] The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly captain to serve as an interpreter;",
              "the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way.",
              "[86] This was the first recorded contact between Europeans and the Maya.",
              "[87] It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes \u2013 the first prophecies of bearded invaders sent by Kukulkan, the northern Maya feathered serpent god, were probably recorded around this time, and in due course passed into the books of Chilam Balam.",
              "[88] In 1511 the Spanish caravel Santa Mari\u0301a de la Barca sailed along the Central American coast under the command of Pedro de Valdivia.",
              "The ship foundered upon a reef somewhere off Jamaica.",
              "[89] There were just twenty survivors from the wreck, including Captain Valdivia, Gero\u0301nimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero.",
              "[90] They set themselves adrift in one of the ship's boats and after thirteen days, during which half of the survivors died, they made landfall upon the coast of Yucata\u0301n.",
              "[89] There they were seized by a Halach Uinik, a Maya lord.",
              "Captain Vildivia was sacrificed with four of his companions, and their flesh was served at a feast.",
              "Aguilar and Guerrero were held prisoner and fattened for killing, together with five or six of their shipmates.",
              "Aguilar and Guerrero managed to escape their captors and fled to a neighbouring lord, who took them prisoner and kept them as slaves.",
              "After a time, Gonzalo Guerrero was passed as a slave to the lord Nachan Can of Chetumal.",
              "Guerrero became completely Mayanised and by 1514 Guerrero had achieved the rank of nacom, a war leader who served against Nachan Can's enemies.",
              "[91] In 1517, Francisco Herna\u0301ndez de Co\u0301rdoba set sail from Cuba with a small fleet.",
              "[92] The expedition sailed west from Cuba for three weeks before sighting the northeastern tip of the Yucata\u0301n Peninsula.",
              "The ships could not put in close to the shore due to the coastal shallows.",
              "However, they could see a Maya city some two leagues inland.",
              "The following morning, ten large canoes rowed out to meet the Spanish ships, and over thirty Maya boarded the vessels and mixed freely with the Spaniards.",
              "[93] The following day the conquistadors put ashore.",
              "As the Spanish party advanced along a path towards the city, they were ambushed by Maya warriors.",
              "Thirteen Spaniards were injured by arrows in the first assault, but the conquistadors regrouped and repulsed the Maya attack.",
              "They advanced to a small plaza upon the outskirts of the city.",
              "[74] When the Spaniards ransacked nearby temples they found a number of low-grade gold items, which filled them with enthusiasm.",
              "The expedition captured two Mayas to be used as interpreters and retreated to the ships.",
              "The Spanish discovered that the Maya arrowheads were fashioned from flint and tended to shatter on impact, causing infected wounds and a slow death;",
              "two of the wounded Spaniards died from the arrow-wounds inflicted in the ambush.",
              "[94] Over the next fifteen days the fleet followed the coastline west, and then south.",
              "[94] The expedition was now perilously short of fresh water, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows.",
              "[95] On 23 February 1517,[96] the Spanish spotted the Maya city of Campeche.",
              "A large contingent put ashore to fill their water casks.",
              "They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats;",
              "they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs.",
              "The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city.",
              "[97] Once inside the city, the Maya leaders made it clear that the Spanish would be killed if they did not withdraw immediately.",
              "The Spanish party retreated in defensive formation to the safety of the ships.",
              "[98] After ten more days, the ships spotted an inlet close to Champoto\u0301n, and a landing party discovered fresh water.",
              "[99] Armed Maya warriors approached from the city, and communication was attempted with signs.",
              "Night fell by the time the water casks had been filled and the attempts at communication concluded.",
              "By sunrise the Spanish had been surrounded by a sizeable army.",
              "The massed Maya warriors launched an assault and all of the Spanish party received wounds in the frantic melee that followed, including Herna\u0301ndez de Co\u0301rdoba.",
              "The Spanish regrouped and forced passage to the shore, where their discipline collapsed and a frantic scramble for the boats ensued, leaving the Spanish vulnerable to the pursuing Maya warriors who waded into the sea behind them.",
              "By the end of the battle, the Spanish had lost over fifty men, more than half their number,[100] and five more men died from their wounds in the following days.",
              "[101] The battle had lasted only an hour.",
              "They were now far from help and low on supplies;",
              "too many men had been lost and injured to sail all three ships back to Cuba, so one was abandoned.",
              "[102] The ship's pilot then steered a course for Cuba via Florida, and Herna\u0301ndez de Cordo\u0301ba wrote a report to Governor Diego Vela\u0301zquez describing the voyage and, most importantly, the discovery of gold.",
              "Herna\u0301ndez died soon after from his wounds.",
              "[103] Diego Vela\u0301zquez, the governor of Cuba, was enthused by Herna\u0301ndez de Co\u0301rdoba's report of gold in Yucata\u0301n.",
              "[96] He organised a new expedition and placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command over his four ships.",
              "[104] The small fleet left Cuba in April 1518,[105] and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel,[106] off the east coast of Yucata\u0301n.",
              "[105] The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish and would not respond to Grijalva's friendly overtures.",
              "The fleet then sailed south along the east coast of the peninsula.",
              "The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast, but Grijalva did not land at any of these and turned back north to loop around the north of the peninsula and sail down the west coast.",
              "[107] At Campeche the Spanish tried to barter for water but the Maya refused, so Grijalva opened fire against the city with small cannon;",

              "[106] At the mouth of the Tabasco River the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not approach.",
              "[108] By means of interpreters, Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies.",
              "From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west.",

              "Grijalva put into Havana five months after he had left.",
              "[105] Grijalva's return aroused great interest in Cuba, and Yucata\u0301n was believed to be a land of riches waiting to be plundered.",
              "A new expedition was organised, with a fleet of eleven ships carrying 500 men and some horses.",
              "Herna\u0301n Corte\u0301s was placed in command, and his crew included officers that would become famous conquistadors, including Pedro de Alvarado, Cristo\u0301bal de Olid, Gonzalo de Sandoval and Diego de Ordaz.",

              "[110] Corte\u0301s sent out messengers to them and was able to rescue the shipwrecked Gero\u0301nimo de Aguilar, who had been enslaved by a Maya lord.",
              "Aguilar had learnt the Yucatec Maya language and became Corte\u0301s' interpreter.",
              "[111] From Cozumel, the fleet looped around the north of the Yucata\u0301n Peninsula and followed the coast to the Grijalva River, which Corte\u0301s named in honour of the Spanish captain who had discovered it.",

              "during this period the southern highlands and northern lowlands can be considered culturally, economically, and politically peripheral to this core area.",
              "Those loci that existed between the core and the periphery acted as centres of trade and commerce.",
              "[55] The most notable monuments are the pyramid-temples and palaces they built in the centres of their greatest cities.",
              "[56] At this time, the use of hieroglyphic script on monuments became widespread, and left a large body of information including dated dynastic records, alliances, and other interactions between Maya polities.",
              "[57] The sculpting of stone stelae spread throughout the Maya area during the Classic period,[58] and pairings of sculpted stelae and low circular altars are considered a hallmark of Classic Maya civilization.",
              "[59] During the Classic period almost every Maya kingdom in the southern lowlands raised stelae in its ceremonial centre.",
              "[60] The epigrapher David Stuart first proposed that the Maya regarded their stelae as te tun, \"stone trees\", although he later revised his reading to lakamtun, meaning \"banner stone\".",
              "[61] According to Stuart this may refer to the stelae as stone versions of vertical standards that once stood in prominent places in Maya city centres, as depicted in ancient Maya graffiti.",
              "[62] The core purpose of a stela was to glorify the king.",
              "[63] The Maya civilization participated in long-distance trade, and important trade routes ran from the Motagua River to the Caribbean Sea, then north up the coast to Yucata\u0301n.",
              "Another route ran from Verapaz along the Pasio\u0301n River to the trading port at Cancuen;",

              "[65] More basic trade goods may have included obsidian, salt and cacao.",
              "[66] During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered major political collapse, marked by the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties and a northward shift in activity.",
              "[32] This decline was coupled with a cessation of monumental inscriptions and large-scale architectural construction.",
              "No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but it is likely to have resulted from a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe environmental degradation, and drought.",
              "[67] During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal show increased activity.",
              "[32] Major cities in the northern Yucata\u0301n Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.",
              "[68] There is evidence that the Maya population exceeded the carrying capacity of the environment, resulting in depleted agricultural resources, deforestation, and overhunting of megafauna.",
              "A 200-year long drought appears to have occurred around the same time.",
              "[69] Classic Maya social organisation was based upon the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution.",
              "This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, with the ruler's freedom of action being limited to traditional responses.",
              "The rulers reacted in their culturally-bound manner, by intensifying such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare.",
              "This was counterproductive and only served to exacerbate systemic problems.[70] By the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of the system of rulership based around the divine power of the ruling lord.",
              "In the northern Yucata\u0301n, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages.",
              "In the southern Yucata\u0301n and central Pete\u0301n, kingdoms generally declined;",
              "in western Pete\u0301n and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities.",
              "[71] Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned.",
              "[72] Relatively rapid collapse affected portions of the southern Maya area that included the southern Yucata\u0301n Peninsula, northern Chiapas and Guatemala, and the area around Copa\u0301n in Honduras.",
              "The largest cities had populations numbering 50,000 to 120,000 and were linked to networks of subsidiary sites.",
              "Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years.",
              "[73] By the late 8th century, endemic warfare had engulfed the Petexbatu\u0301n region of Pete\u0301n, resulting in the abandonment of Dos Pilas and Aguateca.",
              "[74] One by one, many once-great cities stopped sculpting dated monuments and were abandoned;",
              "the last monuments at Palenque, Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan were dated to between 795 and 810, over the following decades, Calakmul, Naranjo, Copa\u0301n, Caracol and Tikal all fell into obscurity.",
              "The last Long Count date was inscribed at Tonina\u0301 in 909.",
              "Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces.",
              "Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Pete\u0301n.",
              "[75] The great cities that dominated Pete\u0301n had fallen into ruin by the beginning of the 10th century AD with the onset of the Classic Maya collapse.",
              "[77] Although much reduced, a significant Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities;",
              "the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.",
              "[78] Unlike during previous cycles of contraction in the Maya region, abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic.",
              "[73] Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands;",
              "this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, since many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths.",
              "[79] Chichen Itza rose to prominence in the north in the 8th century AD, coincident with the abandonments occurring in the south, which underlines the economic and political factors involved in the collapse.",
              "[73] Chichen Itza became what was probably the largest, most powerful and most cosmopolitan of all Maya cities.",
              "[80] Chichen Itza and its Puuc neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century, and this may represent the final episode of the Classic period collapse.",
              "After the decline of Chichen Itza, the Maya region lacked a dominant power until the rise of the city of Mayapan in the 12th century.",
              "New cities arose near the Caribbean and Gulf coasts, and new trade networks were formed.",
              "[81] The Postclassic Period was marked by a series of changes that distinguished its cities from those of the preceding Classic Period.",
              "[82] The once-great city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after a period of continuous occupation that spanned almost two thousand years.",
              "[83] This was symptomatic of changes that were sweeping across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast, with long-occupied cities in exposed locations relocated, apparently due to a proliferation of warfare.",
              "Cities came to occupy more-easily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines, with ditch-and-wall defences sometimes supplementing the protection provided by the natural terrain.",
              "[83] Walled defences have been identified at a number of sites in the north, including Chacchob, Chichen Itza, Cuca, Ek Balam, Mayapan, Muna, Tulum, Uxmal, and Yaxuna.",
              "[84] One of the most important cities in the Guatemalan Highlands at this time was Q\u02bcumarkaj, also known as Utatla\u0301n, the capital of the aggressive K\u02bciche\u02bc Maya kingdom.",
              "[82] The government of Maya states, from the Yucata\u0301n to the Guatemalan highlands, was often organised as joint rule by a council.",
              "However, in practice one member of the council could act as a supreme ruler, with the other members serving him as advisors.",
              "[85] Mayapan was abandoned around 1448, after a period of political, social and environmental turbulence that in many ways echoes the Classic period collapse in the southern Maya region.",
              "The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare in the Yucata\u0301n Peninsula, which only ended shortly before Spanish contact in 1511.",
              "Even without a dominant regional capital, the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces.",
              "[81] During the Late Postclassic, the Yucata\u0301n Peninsula was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in their internal sociopolitical organisation.",
              "[86] Two of the most important provinces were Mani and Sotuta, which were mutually hostile.",
              "[87] At the time of Spanish contact, polities in the northern Yucata\u0301n peninsula included Mani, Cehpech, Chakan, Ah Kin Chel, Cupul, Chikinchel, Ecab, Uaymil, Chetumal, Cochuah, Tases, Hocaba, Sotuta, Chanputun (modern Champoto\u0301n), and Acalan.",
              "[88] A number of polities and groups inhabited the southern portion of the peninsula incorporating the Pete\u0301n Basin, Belize, and surrounding areas,[89] including the Kejache, the Itza,[90] the Kowoj,[91] the Yalain,[92] the Chinamita, the Icaiche, the Manche Ch\u02bcol, and the Mopan.",
              "[93] The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning eastern Chiapas and southwestern Pete\u0301n.",
              "[90] On the eve of the Spanish conquest, the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states.",

              "However, in the late 15th century the Kaqchikel rebelled against their former K\u02bciche\u02bc allies and founded a new kingdom to the southeast, with Iximche as its capital.",

              "Although the final chapter of Tizimin ends on a note of resignation at the ending of this final katun and the seating of the \u201cChristian katun,\u201d the author apparently believed that a new Itza\u0301 cycle was initiated as late as 1824, a testimony to the remarkable endurance and continuity of Maya culture.",
              "I greatly admire Edmonson\u2019s work, but he, like other \u201cwestern\u201d or European scholars, seems to feel the need to rearrange the Maya order of historical events in order to correspond to the European concept of linear time.",

              "Massive pyramids and immense plazas testify to a complex and fascinating culture.",
              "One can hardly hear the word \"Maya\" without imagining elaborately decorated kings and priests climbing the long, steep stairs of pyramids like those at Tikal.",

              "Inomata and his team dug below the monumental architecture at Ceibal to see how such structures began.",
              "Inomata assumed that the now iconic classic architecture probably stood on earlier sites used for similar purposes.",
              "His assumption turned out to be correct.",

              "C.",
              "The presence of ritual architecture early in the development of the Maya is an indication of a settled lifestyle with complex agriculture, religion, and a stratified society\u2014all of which add up to a unified culture and the beginnings of a larger civilization.",
              "Redefining the Olmec Connection Experts have traditionally believed that when the Olmec were busy building their civilization at large sites such as La Venta, near the Gulf coast in modern Mexico, the people who would become the Maya were living in loosely associated nomadic groups in the jungles to the east and southeast.",
              "This theory holds that the Maya derived their entire society\u2014including their architecture and social structure\u2014directly from the Olmec.",

              "More Flexible Definitions To further complicate matters, Inomata stresses that the evidence doesn't show clear distinctions between the Olmec and Maya at the preclassic stage.",
              "The two civilizations are easy to differentiate during the classic period, since the Maya had by then developed a distinct language and culture.",
              "But the period between 1000 and 700 B.",
              "C.",
              "is more transitional.",
              "With La Venta and Ceibal freely trading ideas, technologies, cultural elements, and perhaps even population, it's difficult to call one Olmec and the other Maya.",
              "\"Determining labels for these early people is quite a tricky question\u2014we're not sure if residents of early Ceibal were wholly Mayan,\" says Inomata.",
              "\"We have decided to take a much more flexible approach, avoiding fixed labels in favor of looking at patterns of interaction and how more stable identities developed.\"",
              "An Agricultural Revolution Inomata and his team will spend the next three years analyzing the findings from Ceibal.",
              "They will then begin to excavate outside the site's center, hoping to gain an understanding of what day-to-day life was like in the preclassic period.",
              "The peripheral areas, separated from the ritual plazas and temples, could hold more keys to the origins of the Maya.",

              "\"Instead of starting with villages,\" Inomata says, \"they made a ceremonial center.\"",
              "The idea for that may have come from the people who later created La Venta.",
              "A radical shift in agriculture at that time may also have played an important role in the move to a more settled lifestyle.",
              "Corn, the principal crop of the Maya, \"became much more productive,\" says Inomata.",

              "Why Did the Mayan Civilization Collapse? A New Study Points to ...",
              "Sections A severe drought, exacerbated by widespread logging, appears to have triggered the mysterious Mayan demise Joseph Stromberg Bustling Mayan cities such as Tikal, in present-day Guatemala, were likely abandoned due to a combination of deforestation and drought.",
              "Photo via Wikimedia Commons/Shark It\u2019s long been one of ancient history\u2019s most intriguing mysteries: Why did the Maya, a remarkably sophisticated civilization made up of more than 19 million people, suddenly collapse sometime during the 8th or 9th centuries?",
              "Although the Mayan people never entirely disappeared\u2014their descendants still live across Central America\u2014dozens of core urban areas in the lowlands of the Yucatan peninsula, such as Tikal, went from bustling cities to abandoned ruins over the course of roughly a hundred years.",
              "Scholars and laypeople have proposed countless theories accounting for the collapse, ranging from the plausible (overhunting, foreign invasion, peasant revolt) to the absurd (alien invasion, supernatural forces).",
              "In his 2005 book Collapse, though, Jared Diamond put forth a different sort of theory\u2014that a prolonged drought, exacerbated by ill-advised deforestation, forced Mayan populations to abandon their cities.",
              "That hypothesis has finally been put to the test with archaeological evidence and environmental data and the results published this week in a pair of studies.",
              "In the first study, published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from Arizona State University analyzed archaeological data from across the Yucatan to reach a better understanding of the environmental conditions when the area was abandoned.",
              "Around this time, they found, severe reductions in rainfall were coupled with an rapid rate of deforestation, as the Mayans burned and chopped down more and more forest to clear land for agriculture.",
              "Interestingly, they also required massive amounts of wood to fuel the fires that cooked the lime plaster for their elaborate constructions\u2014experts estimate it would have taken 20 trees to produce a single square meter of cityscape.",
              "The central Yucatan lowland, site of most major Mayan cities, was abandoned due to the stresses of deforestation and drought.",
              "Image via Barbara Trapido-Lurie/Arizona State University The other study, published by researchers from Columbia University and elsewhere this week in Geophysical Research Letters, applied quantitative data to these trends.",
              "Using population records and measurements from current forested and cleared lands in the region, they constructed a computer model of deforestation in the Yucatan and ran simulations to see how this would have affected rainfall.",
              "Because cleared land absorbs less solar radiation, less water evaporates from its surface, making clouds and rainfall more scarce.",
              "As a result, the rapid deforestation exacerbated an already severe drought\u2014in the simulation, deforestation reduced precipitation by five to 15 percent and was responsible for 60 percent of the total drying that occurred over the course of a century as the Mayan civilization collapsed.",
              "The lack of forest cover also contributed to erosion and soil depletion.",
              "In a time of unprecedented population density, this combination of factors was likely catastrophic.",
              "Crops failed, especially because the droughts occurred disproportionately during the summer growing season.",
              "Coincidentally, trade shifted from overland routes, which crossed the heart of the lowland, to sea-based voyages, moving around the perimeter of the peninsula.",
              "Since the traditional elite relied largely upon this trade\u2014along with annual crop surpluses\u2014to build wealth, they were sapped of much of their power.",
              "This forced peasants and craftsmen into making a critical choice, perhaps necessary to escape starvation: abandoning the lowlands.",
              "The results are the ornate ruins that stretch across the peninsula today.",
              "The collapse is especially intriguing because it seemingly occurred at \u201ca time in which developed a sophisticated understanding of their environment, built and sustained intensive production and water systems and withstood at least two long-term episodes of aridity,\u201d says B.",

              "One of the lessons of these complementary studies, says climate modeler Robert Oglesby of the University of Nebraska, who worked on the second paper, is that our reshaping of the environment can often have unintended consequences\u2014and we may not have any idea of what they are until it\u2019s too late.",
