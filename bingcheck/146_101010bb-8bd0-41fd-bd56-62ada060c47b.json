    "query": "What is the history and cultural significance behind the ancient art of paper folding, origami, and how has it evolved into a modern-day form of artistic expression and mathematical study?",
    "response": "Origami is the art of folding paper to create various shapes and forms. The word origami comes from Japanese oru (\u201cto fold\u201d) and kami (\u201cpaper\u201d)[^1^]. Origami has a long and rich history that spans across different cultures and regions.\n\nOrigami is believed to have originated in China, where paper was invented around the first or second century[^2^] [^3^]. Paper folding was then introduced to Japan by Buddhist monks in the sixth century[^2^] [^4^]. In Japan, origami became a popular form of artistic expression and cultural tradition. Some of the earliest examples of origami in Japan include folded paper butterflies used in Shinto weddings and linked cranes used as a symbol of peace[^2^].\n\nOrigami also developed independently in other parts of the world, such as Europe, where paper folding was used for napkin folding, cloth pleating, and religious ceremonies[^2^]. In the 19th century, origami was influenced by German educators such as Friedrich Froebel and Rudolf Steiner, who advocated paper folding as a way of teaching geometry, creativity, and hand-eye coordination to children[^2^].\n\nIn the 20th century, origami became more widely known and practiced around the world, thanks to the efforts of various artists, mathematicians, and enthusiasts. Some of the notable figures in modern origami include Akira Yoshizawa, who created a system of notation and symbols for origami diagrams; Robert J. Lang, who applied mathematical principles and computer algorithms to design complex origami models; and Eric Joisel, who pioneered the wet-folding technique that allows for more sculptural and expressive origami forms[^1^].\n\nToday, origami is a diverse and vibrant art form that continues to evolve and inspire people of all ages and backgrounds. Origami can be used for decoration, entertainment, education, science, engineering, and even therapy. Origami can also reflect the personality and style of the folder, whether it is realistic, abstract, simple, or intricate[^1^].",

              "While cutting was traditionally a part of origami, most modern practitioners\u2014often called \u201cfolders\u201d\u2014eschew cutting (although it continues to be used in the Rokoan style of connected cranes).",

              "Creative competitions involve varying degrees of competitiveness.",

              "A great book featuring his work called \"Akira Yoshizawa\" was published in September 2016.",
              "Origami did not initially allow any cutting or gluing, but standards have loosened considerably over the years.",

              "Unfortunately, only a few hundred of these models were ever officially documented in his published origami books.",
              "Yoshizawa also pioneered the popular wet-folding origami technique, which involves spraying paper with a fine mist of water in order to create folds with a rounder and more sculpted appearance.",
              "A great book featuring his work called \"Akira Yoshizawa\" was published in September 2016.",
              "Origami did not initially allow any cutting or gluing, but standards have loosened considerably over the years.",
              "Today, you will see many origami books with models that involve some form of cutting or gluing to provide increased stability to the final design.",
              "Another way in which origami has evolved is that figures are no longer folded exclusively with origami paper.",
              "Today, you can find paper-folding enthusiasts who work with wrapping paper, typing paper, scrapbook paper, and various forms of handmade paper.",

              "Writing a comprehensive history of paper folding is almost impossible, since information about the art form prior to the 15th century is virtually nonexistent.",
              "There are many plausible assertions about its origins and early history, but most of those are based on little firm documentation.",
              "Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China.",
              "It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials before paper was invented, so the origins of recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather.",
              "Certainly, within Europe, the practise of napkin folding and cloth pleating were held in high esteem.",
              "However, paper has proved to be the ideal material to fold, and so it is logical to assume that paper folding followed the discovery of the papermaking process.",
              "Paper was invented in China, and a Chinese court official, Cai Lun, has been traditionally credited as the inventor, though contemporary research suggests that paper was invented earlier.",
              "However, Cai is known to have introduced the concept of sheets of paper about the year 105 ce.",
              "By making paper from the macerated bark of trees, hemp waste, old rags, and fishnets, he discovered a far superior and cheaper way of creating a writing surface, compared with the cloth made of silk that was commonly used.",
              "Papermaking skills subsequently migrated to Korea and from there to Japan, via Buddhist monks, by 610.",
              "Japanese papermakers improved the quality of paper still further, and the quality of their paper would have been suitable for folding, although no hard evidence of origami exists before 1600.",
              "In 1680 a short poem by poet and novelist Ihara Saikaku references butterfly origami, revealing how well engrained in Japanese culture paper folding had become by that time.",
              "One of the earliest known paper-folding instruction books was Akisato Rito\u2019s Sembazuru orikata (1797), and it showed how to fold linked cranes cut and folded from a square of paper.",
              "German educator Friedrich Froebel (1782\u20131852), inventor of the kindergarten, was an avid proponent of paper folding and its educational benefits, and he helped to spread paper folding around the world.",
              "Three basic types of folds are associated with him: the Folds of Life (basic folds that introduced kids to paper folding), the Folds of Truth (teaching basic principles of geometry), and the Folds of Beauty (more-advanced folds based on squares, hexagons, and octagons);",
              "the famed folded and woven paper Froebel star, a popular Christmas craft and decoration, was named after him but was likely invented by someone else.",
              "About 1880 those Froebelian folds were introduced into Japan and Japanese schools, and it was about that time that the word origami began to be used to describe recreational folding.",
              "German contributions to paper folding continued with Rudolf Steiner\u2019s first Waldorf school (1919), in Stuttgart, Germany, which emphasized assorted hands-on activities including origami, and with the Bauhaus school of design (1919\u201333).",
              "Bauhaus used paper folding as a means of training students in commercial design, and revered Bauhaus teacher and artist Josef Albers was especially adept at creating dome-shaped structures from flat sheets of paper.",
              "Spanish author and philosopher Miguel de Unamuno (1864\u20131936) was also significant in spreading origami\u2019s popularity.",
              "He was a celebrated paper folder who could be found in cafe\u0301s making paper birds.",

              "\u201cLove and Pedagogy\u201d), and even used it as a metaphor for his deeper discussions of science, religion, philosophy, and life.",
              "Paper folding spread across South America as well, principally because of the work of the Argentine physician and master folder Vicente Solo\u0301rzano Sagredo (1883\u20131970), author of the most comprehensive manuals on paper folding in Spanish.",
              "In England Margaret Campbell\u2019s seminal book Paper Toy Making was published in 1937, and it contained a large collection of origami designs.",

              "H.",
              "Stone, whose paper structures altered their faces in curious ways when properly flexed, gave a boost to both the recreational and educational popularity of paper folding.",
              "After World War II there was increasing interest in origami in North America, and the subject was intensively researched, especially by folklorist Gershon Legman in the United States.",
              "In 1955 Legman arranged an exhibition in Amsterdam of the origami of the Japanese master Akira Yoshizawa (1911\u20132005).",
              "Yoshizawa was considered the preeminent folder of his time, and his work inspired subsequent generations of folders.",
              "Also in the 1950s, Lillian Oppenheimer helped popularize the word origami and introduce it to Americans.",
              "She founded the Origami Center of America in New York in 1958, used the relatively new medium of television to popularize the art form, and produced several books on origami with children\u2019s entertainer and TV star Shari Lewis;",
              "as Oppenheimer was fond of saying, \u201cWhy should the Japanese have all the fun?",
              "\u201d In the 1960s and early \u201970s, American folders such as Fred Rohm and Neal Elias developed novel techniques that produced models of unprecedented complexity.",
              "By the late 1980s, Jun Maekawa, Fumiaki Kawahata, Issei Yoshino, and Meguro Toshiyuki in Japan and Peter Engel, Robert Lang, and John Montroll in the United States had advanced techniques still further, inspiring, for example, the folding of creatures and insects with multiple legs and antennae.",
              "In the early 1990s Lang developed a computer program (TreeMaker) to assist in the precise folding of bases and another one (ReferenceFinder) for finding short, efficient folding sequences for any point or line within a unit square.",
              "Scores of origami societies exist around the world.",
              "Especially significant is the Japan Origami Academic Society, which is a conduit for many of the most innovative constructions in contemporary origami."

              "[1][2] However, this page describes the history of both ceremonial and recreational origami.",
              "The modern growth of interest in origami dates to the design in 1954 by Akira Yoshizawa of a notation to indicate how to fold origami models.",
              "[3][4] The Yoshizawa-Randlett system is now used internationally.",
              "Today the popularity of origami has given rise to origami societies such as the British Origami Society and OrigamiUSA.",
              "The first known origami social group was founded in Zaragoza, Spain during the 1940s.",
              "[5] By the 7th century, paper had been introduced to Japan from China via the Korean Peninsula, and the Japanese developed washi by improving the method of making paper in the Heian period.",
              "The paper making technique developed in Japan around 805 to 809 was called nagashi-suki (\u6d41\u3057\u6f09\u304d), a method of adding mucilage to the process of the conventional tame-suki (\u6e9c\u3081\u6f09\u304d) technique to form a stronger layer of paper fibers.",
              "[1][2][6][7] With the development of Japanese paper making technology and the widespread use of paper, folded paper began to be used for decorations and tools for religious ceremonies such as gohei, o\u0304nusa (ja:\u5927\u9ebb (\u795e\u9053)) and shide at Shinto shrines.",
              "Religious decorations made of paper and the way gifts were wrapped in folded paper gradually became stylized and established as ceremonial origami.",
              "[1][2] During the Heian period, the Imperial court established a code of etiquette for wrapping money and goods used in ceremonies with folded paper, and a code of etiquette for wrapping gifts.",
              "[8] In the Muromachi period from the 1300s to the 1400s, various forms of decorum were developed by the Ogasawara clan and Ise clans (ja:\u4f0a\u52e2\u6c0f), completing the prototype of Japanese folded-paper decorum that continues to this day.",

              "The shapes of ceremonial origami created in this period were geometric, and the shapes of noshi to be attached to gifts at feasts and weddings, and origami that imitated butterflies to be displayed on sake vessels, were quite different from those of later generations of recreational origami whose shapes captured the characteristics of real objects and living things.",
              "The \"noshi\" wrapping, and the folding of female and male butterflies, which are still used for weddings and celebrations, are a continuation and development of a tradition that began in the Muromachi period.",

              "This included origami of various designs, including paper models of cranes, which are still well known today, and it is thought that by this time, many people were familiar with origami for play, which modern people recognize as origami.",
              "During this period, origami was commonly called orikata (\u6298\u5f62) or orisue (\u6298\u636e) and was often used as a pattern on kimonos and decorations.",

              "In describing the piece, he writes: I intended to cover the whole of the history of paperfolding in three short pieces.",
              "However, the third piece, covering Origami in the West since the formation of the origami Center in 1958, still has to be written.",
              "It is partly because I am still chewing round how to select and organize the enormous amount of information, and partly beause I have been busy with other things.",
              "Mr.",
              "Lister cautions that these pieces are by no means a complete History of Origami, and that there may be errors and omissions.",
              "We are all looking forward to David Lister's complete origami history in a published format, but in the meantime we can still learn so much from his wonderful \"miscellaneous collections of jottings\", presented to you here: This time, I thought I would write something about the history of paperfolding in Europe up to about 1945.",
              "As I have said, Paperfolding in Europe MAY have been brought from the East, with the coming of paper making (which certainly did come from the East through the Arabs) or along the Silk Route with the traders through Asia, or through the sailors travelling by ship between Europe and the East.",
              "The Dutch, especially traded with the Far East and retained a very tenuous connection with Japan throughout the period of Japan's self-imposed isolation from the rest of the world, through the permitted Dutch trading post on an island outside Nagasaki.",
              "However, we still have no evidence at all that European folding came from the East.",
              "It is equally possible that because paper can only be folded in a limited number of simple ways, that European folding spontaneously arose in Europe.",
              "We do know that pleated folding of cloth existed in the West since Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine periods.",
              "I will say something more about cloth folding in Europe, before I go on to paperfolding, because the folding of cloth and of paper are clearly related.",
              "During the 16th Century and throughout the 17th Century, there developed in Europe a tradition for folding table napkins into elaborate models of animals and ships and other objects in the palaces of royalty and the great nobility.",
              "Napkins were pleated and cross-pleated and moulded into elaborate creations which decorated the tables at banquets.",
              "This was not much like modern paperfolding, but some of the figures of paperfoldinl such as the waterbomb base are found in the manuals on the subject.",
              "The napkins were pleated and cross-pleated and the moulded into shape, often being stitched together with red thread.",
              "Possibly the tradition of folding table napkins as done at the present day derives from this period of folding.",
              "What is remarkable about it is that is parallels the Japanese ceremonial foldsN0shi and tsutsumi) in that like them it used pleating and was used for ceremonial, not recreational purposes.",
              "Paper making was introduced into Europe much later than into Japan.",
              "It was brought by the Moors, who were converted to Islam by the Arabs.",
              "Papermaking reached Spain in 1036, Italy in 1256 and France in 1348.",
              ".",
              "So there could not be any paperfolding in Europe before the 13th Century, except perhaps in Spain, the southern part of which was then controlled by the Moors.",
              "But as I have said, we have no evidence that the Moors practised paperfolding.",
              "Bearing in mind this background, we have only glimpses of paperfolding in Europe until the 19th Century.",
              "One of the earliest pieces of \"evidence\" is the use of the pattern of the windmill base for astrological diagrams in the south of Spain in the 12th Century.",
              "Horoscopes were drawn up based on a person's birth and we know that baptismal certificates were later foldid into a double or treble blintz, which is related to the Windmill base.",
              "But the 12th century seems early for paperfolding in Spain and we cannot be sure of this as proper evidence.",
              "A second piece of evidence is from a book printed in Venice in 1490, namely \"Tractatus de Spaera Mundi\" by Johannes de Sacrobusto.",
              "It has a diagram of the world showing ships sailing on a sea in front of a town.",
              "The ships look VERY like the simple little boats which are folded by children everywhere from the simple paper hat.",
              "But again, the picture is ambiguous and cannot be relied upon with certainty.",
              "In 1614, the English playwrightJ ohn Webster produced his play \"The Duchess of Malfi\".",
              "He refers to the paper prisons in which small boys capture flies to increase the loudness of the buzzing.",
              "This is the water-bomb of paper balloon and it is known from modern China, from modern Egypt as well as England in 1614.",
              "It is convincing evidence that paperfolding was known in England in 1614.",
              "Another glimpse is of a boy, Guillermo Pen of Spain in 1757, who made his friends kites, boats , ships, birds and many other things out of paper.",
              "There are other similar reports from different parts of Eurpoe about the same time.",
              "In 1806 a clear drawing of the paper \"Chinese Junk\" was made in Holland.",
              "It certainly shows that this model was known in Europe at that time.",
              "Since it was in Holland, it may have been brought there from th4e East Freidrich Froebel, the educator was born in 1782 and we know that he played with paperfolding as a boy in Germany.",
              "Some paperfolded soldiers, some on foot and some on horseback actually exist in a museum in Nuremburg in Germany.",
              "We can assume that by then paperfolding was widely known in Europe.",
              "From the evidence we have, it is likely that nearly all European paperfolding was derived from the waterbomb base or from the windmill base.",
              "There is no indication that at this time either the bird base of the frog bases were known, as they were in Japan.",
              "Friedrich Froebel founded the kindergarten movement and he encouraged children to practise paperfolding of three kinds.",
              "The were (1) the \"Folds of Truth\", which consisted mathematical folding.",
              "(2) \"Folds of Life\" which were the traditional children'ss folds of animal birds and simple objects;",
              "and (3) \"Folds of beauty\" which were decorative patterns mainly folded from the Blintz Base.",
              "Yet there was still no knowledge of the bird base or the frog base.",
              "Froebelian folding was carried all over Europe and the world with the spread of the kindergarten movement.",
              "It was taken to North and South America and even to Japan.",
              "In Japan, Froebelian folding became merged with the native Japanese tradition of children's folding.",
              "After the end of the Japanese isolation in 1854,, Japanese stage magicians began to come to Europe and North America, performing in theatres and at exhibitions.",
              "The dates are not precisely know.",
              "There are reports that one of their tricks was to pre-crease a flapping bird.",
              "They would then show the unfolded square to the audience so that the bright footlights concealed the previously made creases.",
              "Then with a few deft flicks they produced the Flapping Bird as if by magic.",
              "This was the introduction of the Slapping Bird to the West.",
              "But where it came from is a mystery, because it is the crane (\"tsuru\"), which is known in Japan, not the flapping bird.",
              "One suggestion is that someone was trying to remember how to fold the crane but hit upon the flapping bird by mistake.",
              "Knowledge of the Flapping Bird spread through Europe.",
              "The first publication we know so far is in the British \"Boys' Own paper\" in 1886.",
              "But the illustration is typically French and there may be earlier instances waiting to be discovered.",
              "For the most part, while the Flapping Bird itself became popular there was generally no immediate movement to use the Bird base for folding in Europe.",
              "The idea of creating one's own models, for the most part, simply did not exist.",
              "It seems, however that in the villages Spain there existed a tradition of creative folding centred round the Pajarita.",
              "Unfortunately very little evidence for this movement survives either in practice or in any records.",
              "Miguel Unamuno, the Spanish poet and philosopher may have derived inspiration from it but we do not know.",
              "Then, in the later years of the 19th century, Unamuno hit upon the idea of creating his own models by folding some variants of the Pajarita.",
              "By the beginning of the 20th Century he was using the Bird Base fold some rather angular animals and birds.",
              "It appears that Unamuno's folding linked with the existing Spanish tradition of folding and gave rise to group of followers in Spain itself.",
              "Then his folding was taken to Argentina in South America, where a group of folders, and in particular Dr.",
              "Solorzano Sagerdo, developed paper folding much further.",
              "Solorzano published several important books about folding around 1940.",
              "For the time being, however, paperfolding of Spain and Argentina was little known outside those countries.",
              "It is interesting that at the time there was a Japanese community in Argentine who had a paperfolding society of their own.",
              "The late 19th Century saw the publication of paperfolding in books in both Europe and North America.",
              "Usually they were included in books of children's recreations.",
              "An early instance was Cassellss \"Book of Indoor Amusements\" published in London in 1881.",
              "There were many other similar books.",
              "Burt the models that they contained were still the old traditional childrenss folds, with an occasional different fold having only curiosity value.",
              "Then in the 1920s books devoted to paper magic (literally, conjuring with paper) appeared and contained paperfolded figures.",
              "They included \"Paper Magic\" by Will Blythe in 1920 and Houdini's \"Paper Magic\" by the famous escapologist Harry Houdini in 1922.",

              "Writing a comprehensive history of paper folding is almost impossible, since information about the art form prior to the 15th century is virtually nonexistent.",
              "There are many plausible assertions about its origins and early history, but most of those are based on little firm documentation.",
              "Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China.",
              "It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to other materials before paper was invented, so the origins of recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather.",
              "Certainly, within Europe, the practise of napkin folding and cloth pleating were held in high esteem.",
              "However, paper has proved to be the ideal material to fold, and so it is logical to assume that paper folding followed the discovery of the papermaking process.",
              "Paper was invented in China, and a Chinese court official, Cai Lun, has been traditionally credited as the inventor, though contemporary research suggests that paper was invented earlier.",
              "However, Cai is known to have introduced the concept of sheets of paper about the year 105 ce.",
              "By making paper from the macerated bark of trees, hemp waste, old rags, and fishnets, he discovered a far superior and cheaper way of creating a writing surface, compared with the cloth made of silk that was commonly used.",
              "Papermaking skills subsequently migrated to Korea and from there to Japan, via Buddhist monks, by 610.",
              "Japanese papermakers improved the quality of paper still further, and the quality of their paper would have been suitable for folding, although no hard evidence of origami exists before 1600.",
              "In 1680 a short poem by poet and novelist Ihara Saikaku references butterfly origami, revealing how well engrained in Japanese culture paper folding had become by that time.",
              "One of the earliest known paper-folding instruction books was Akisato Rito\u2019s Sembazuru orikata (1797), and it showed how to fold linked cranes cut and folded from a square of paper.",
              "German educator Friedrich Froebel (1782\u20131852), inventor of the kindergarten, was an avid proponent of paper folding and its educational benefits, and he helped to spread paper folding around the world.",
              "Three basic types of folds are associated with him: the Folds of Life (basic folds that introduced kids to paper folding), the Folds of Truth (teaching basic principles of geometry), and the Folds of Beauty (more-advanced folds based on squares, hexagons, and octagons);",
              "the famed folded and woven paper Froebel star, a popular Christmas craft and decoration, was named after him but was likely invented by someone else.",

              "Origami has a long and storied history spanning numerous cultures and eras.",
              "In its early days, origami developed independently in East and West as both a ceremonial craft and recreational pastime before interconnecting in the modern era.",
              "While origami\u2019s origins are ancient, its exponential growth primarily occurred over the past century.",
              "Through pioneering innovators and global collaboration, origami experienced a creative explosion in techniques, complexity, and practical applications.",
              "Computational design, mathematical principles, and cross-disciplinary connections with fields like science and education unlocked origami\u2019s immense potential.",
              "An art form once limited to simple folds became a vibrant international medium pushing the boundaries of creativity and innovation.",
              "This post will trace origami\u2019s progression from its mysterious beginnings to the groundbreaking revolution of today, showing how a humble paper craft evolved into a globally significant art and tool primed for an awe-inspiring future.",
              "Paper was first invented in China, with archaeological evidence showing some of the earliest known examples dating back to between 140-87 BC.",
              "This early paper was rough and used for clothing rather than writing.",
              "By the 1st century AD, specimens were being used for writing and wrapping delicate items. The origins of papermaking are traditionally attributed to Cai (or Ts\u2019ai) Lun, a Chinese court official during the Han Dynasty around 100 AD.",
              "Cai Lun was charged with managing state records and recognized the need for a better writing medium than inefficient materials like bamboo and silk.",
              "However, recent archaeological discoveries from the 2nd century BC suggest paper was already being used earlier by the Chinese military.",
              "This indicates Cai Lun\u2019s role was likely improving and promoting the nascent technology of paper rather than inventing it himself.",
              "Cai Lun is credited with refining the papermaking process using inexpensive materials like bark, hemp, rags, and fishing nets.",
              "This innovation made paper cheaper to produce compared to relying solely on rags.",
              "Paper quickly spread across China, aided by the invention of woodblock printing during the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century AD.",
              "By the 6th century, toilet paper was already in use.",
              "Paper was also central to the arts of poetry, painting, and calligraphy.",
              "The lightweight and flexible paper medium allowed books to be efficiently produced and transported, expanding Chinese written culture.",
              "From China, the secrets of papermaking gradually spread to Vietnam by the 3rd century AD, Korea by the 4th century AD, and finally Japan by the 5th century AD \u2013 often carried by traveling Buddhist monks.",
              "Paper from Korea was prized for its glossy white color, perfect for painting and calligraphy.",
              "Papermaking was traditionally thought to have been introduced to Japan from Korea around 610 AD by a Buddhist monk named Doncho (or Damjing).",
              "However, some scholars have questioned whether Doncho was definitively the first to bring paper to Japan.",
              "The Nihon Shoki, written in 720 AD, simply states that Doncho produced paper, colors, and ink skillfully \u2013 not necessarily that he introduced those crafts.",
              "Archaeological evidence shows paper was already in use for government records in Japan by that time.",
              "The passage on Doncho may have just been complimenting his adeptness with papermaking rather than crediting him as the source.",
              "Regardless, papermaking techniques from Korea took hold in Japan during the 6th-7th centuries AD, enabling key artistic and literary advances.",
              "The Japanese refined methods to produce their prized traditional handmade washi paper.",
              "Washi became revered worldwide for its strength and quality.",
              "While the pioneers remain uncertain, this period was pivotal in establishing papermaking in Japan.",
              "Evidence of recreational paper folding in Japan before the 17th century is very limited.",
              "However, ceremonial and utilitarian folding practices existed earlier.",
              "For instance, tato containers and letter folding may date back to the Heian period (794-1185 AD).",
              "Ocho and mecho butterflies were ceremonially used to decorate sake flasks in the 1300s-1400s Muromachi period.",
              "Their origins may have been as paper covers for flasks.",
              "Tsutsumi gift-wrapping techniques also became important in the Muromachi period, establishing folding etiquette.",
              "During the Heian period, folded paper decorations and tools like gohei, onusa, and shide became part of Shinto religious rituals.",
              "The Muromachi period saw geometrically folded noshi attached to gifts and abstract butterflies displayed on sake vessels as part of formal etiquette.",
              "These ceremonial origami styles were highly stylized, contrasting with later recreational folding that realistically represented objects.",
              "Overall, direct evidence of recreational folding in Japan before the 17th century is scarce.",
              "But ceremonial and utilitarian folding existed, though its recreational origins remain a mystery.",
              "Folding may have also developed in China along with paper itself, but firm proof is lacking.",
              "The early history of origami is masked by the limited surviving evidence.",
              "By the early 17th century, recreational paper folding was thriving in Japan alongside ceremonial origami.",
              "This marks the first definitive evidence of origami made purely for amusement and play rather than ritual purposes.",
              "Simple recreational folds like boats, hats, cubes, and the iconic tsuru (crane) were widespread by the mid-1600s based on pictorial depictions in early sources.",
              "Books like Ramma Zushiki published in 1747 show the boom in recreational origami, with instructions for folds like boats, cranes, cubes, and early modular toys.",
              "Ukiyo-e prints and kimono patterns from the 1600s-1700s commonly featured recreational origami motifs.",
              "Poems and texts also referenced recreational folding, like Ihara Saikaku\u2018s 1680 haiku: Rosei ga yume no cho wa orisue (the butterflies in Rosei\u2019s dream would be origami).",
              "The Kan no Mado manuscript compiled around 1845 contains a wide collection of whimsical recreational folds, suggesting origami\u2019s popularity as a hobby by the early 1800s.",
              "The earliest known origami book, Hiden Senbazuru Orikata published in 1797, contained instructions for folding dozens of interconnected cranes from one sheet.",
              "In the Edo period, recreational origami was commonly called \u201corikata\u201d or \u201corisue\u201d and wasn\u2019t strictly differentiated from ceremonial folding.",
              "Both served as creative pastimes alongside arts like poetry and painting.",
              "Specific recreational folds also emerged like the Komoso and Yakko-san figures.",
              "While its early origins are murky, recreational folding flourished in Japan during the 1600s-1700s based on the many depictions and texts.",
              "The Edo era marked origami\u2019s transition from solely ritual to a widespread recreational practice.",
              "In contrast to Japan, recreational paper folding developed more sporadically in medieval Europe.",
              "The earliest evidence appears in the 15th-16th centuries based on depictions of paperfolds in texts and artworks.",
              "The 1614 English play \u201cDuchess of Malfi\u201d, by John Webster, seems to reference the traditional paper waterbomb, which indicates that recreational folding was familiar by the early 1600s.",
              "Paper folding likely derived from other European folding traditions like decorative napkin folding popular in the 15th century.",
              "Napkin and cloth folding laid the groundwork for recreational paper folding to later arise as paper spread.",
              "Napkins shaped into birds, animals, ships, and other forms decorated banquet tables of nobles and royalty.",
              "Books like Li Tre Trattati published in 1639 in Italy contained diagrams for folding napkins into various origami-like shapes.",
              "The 1639 book shared many patterns with George Philipp Harsdo\u0308rffer\u2019s Trincir-Buch published in Germany in 1665, showing the prevalence of decorative napkin folding.",
              "While not strictly paper folding, napkin folding helped spread folding techniques and creative shapes that cross-pollinated with recreational paper origami\u2019s later development.",
              "In the mid-19th century, the Kindergarten movement founded by Friedrich Fro\u0308bel (1782-1852) in Germany helped popularize recreational paperfolding across Europe and eventually worldwide.",
              "As an educator, Fro\u0308bel recognized paper folding, weaving, sewing, and cutting as beneficial developmental activities for young children.",
              "His revolutionary Kindergarten system incorporated paper folds as educational tools, spreading recreational folding globally as Kindergartens proliferated.",
              "While the Kindergarten style focused on geometric \u201cFolds of Beauty\u201d, it made paper folding accessible to the masses.",
              "As Kindergartens opened worldwide in the late 1800s, they brought colored paper and recreational origami along with Fro\u0308bel\u2019s educational principles.",
              "This laid crucial groundwork for the widespread adoption of folding, though some argued Fro\u0308belian folding became creatively restrictive.",
              "While recreational origami developed independently in Japan and the West through the 19th century, some cross-cultural transmission also occurred.",
              "For instance, traditional Japanese folds like the crane and flapping bird migrated to Europe and America starting in the 1870s, likely brought by visiting Japanese performers and educators at World Expos.",
              "At the same time, Japanese schools adopted aspects of Fro\u0308bel\u2019s Kindergarten paper folding in the 1880s, blending some Western geometric methods with native origami.",
              "So by the late 19th century, origami was no longer evolving in complete isolation between East and West.",
              "Some creative techniques began circulating globally through performances, teaching practices, and trade.",
              "The modern origami renaissance blossomed in the mid-20th century, catalyzed by pioneering folders in Japan and the United States.",
              "In Japan, Akira Yoshizawa developed a radically creative new approach to origami in the 1930s-50s.",
              "He introduced innovations like wet-shaping techniques to create lifelike figures.",
              "Yoshizawa also originated the iconic dotted-line system used today for origami diagrams, working with Samuel Randlett to standardize symbols.",
              "Through thousands of expressive designs, Yoshizawa elevated origami into an artistic medium.",
              "Yoshizawa\u2019s groundbreaking works reached global fame thanks to Gershon Legman, an American origami enthusiast.",
              "Starting in the 1950s, Legman organized some of the first major exhibitions of Yoshizawa\u2019s origami outside Japan.",
              "He connected Yoshizawa with folders worldwide through his research and writings.",
              "This pivotal promotion helped introduce Yoshizawa\u2019s creative style internationally.",
              "In the United States, Lillian Oppenheimer founded the pioneering Origami Center in New York City in 1958.",
              "This organization hosted exhibitions, published instructional books/magazines, and spread awareness of origami as a creative art for all ages.",
              "Oppenheimer gave opportunities to innovators like Neal Elias and Michael Shall.",
              "Her work made origami a recognized artistic medium.",
              "Together, Yoshizawa\u2019s radical creative approach as the \u201cfather of modern origami,\u201d Legman\u2019s promotion, and Oppenheimer\u2019s organizational efforts catalyzed the worldwide modern origami movement.",
              "Their synergistic global partnership marked a pivotal new era for origami as an international art form starting in the 1950s-60s.",
              "The modern origami movement led to an explosion of origami societies, books, and magazines worldwide from the 1950s-60s onward.",
              "National origami organizations like the British Origami Society, Centre de Diffusion de l\u2019Origami in France, and Origami Center of America formed starting in the 1960s.",
              "These pioneering member groups provided platforms for artists to collaborate and gave rise to conventions.",
              "Many influential creators began publishing their original models and instructional manuals, spreading innovative techniques globally.",
              "For instance, Akira Yoshizawa produced numerous seminal books in Japan showcasing his works.",
              "Yoshizawa\u2019s diagram system also became widely adopted.",
              "Origami periodicals like the British Origami Society\u2019s The Paper started alongside similar magazines from origami societies around the world.",
              "Books for beginners like Paper Magic by Robert Harbin also appeared in the 1950s-60s.",
              "This explosion of organized societies, conventions, dedicated books/magazines, and activity books helped drive origami\u2019s soaring popularity as a global creative art during its modern renaissance starting in the mid-late 20th century.",

              "TreeMaker - Lang Origami",
              "In 1989, I wrote an article for the magazine Engineering & Science about the state of technical folding, which, even then, seemed to be progressing by leaps and bounds due to an infusion of scientific and mathematical principles.",
              "In recounting some of the connections between origami, math, and technology, I wrote: Computing succumbed to the appeal of folded paper when, in 1971, Arthur Appel programmed an IBM System 360 computer to print out simple geometric configurations at the rate of more than one hundred a minute.",
              "Ninety percent were considered unsuccessful, but it raises an interesting question: could a computer someday design a model deemed superior to that designed by man?",
              "Since so much of the process of design is geometric, the prospect is not as outrageous as it may seem.",
              "The ensuing decade saw this speculation turned into reality (and no one was more surprised than me!)",
              "Within the next few years, the powerful design techniques of circle-river packing had been discovered and systematized by multiple folders, including myself, Toshiyuki Meguro in Japan, and others.",
              "Building on these concepts, I set out in the early 1990s to do exactly what I\u2019d speculated on in my E&S article: write a computer program that could \u201cdesign\u201d a non-trivial origami figure based on a description of the number, lengths, and connectedness of the flaps.",
              "After several months of work I had succeeded;",
              "and the result, was a computer program, which I dubbed TreeMaker, since it started with a particular type of stick figure (called a tree in graph theory).",
              "Initially, TreeMaker was little more than a mathematical curiosity and a tool for exploring the mathematical theory of how to design a base.",
              "The first version did little more than solve the associated circle-packing problem, but gave no clue as to how to fill in the bulk of the creases.",
              "Over the years, as my understanding of crease patterns grew, I added what knowledge I gained to TreeMaker, adding algorithms for computing molecules, imposing symmetries, and introducing strain into the stick figure, releasing new versions every few years.",
              "By 1998, I had finished version 4.",
              "0 of TreeMaker, which, in addition to including many algorithms for the origami design, incorporated a powerful numerical optimization code, CFSQP developed by Professor Andre Tits and his students at the University of Maryland (the code is now licensed and maintained by AEM Design;",
              "this made it run very fast.",
              "And suddenly, TreeMaker was no longer an academic curiosity;",
              "it had become a powerful tool, capable of constructing the full crease pattern for a wide variety of origami bases.",
              "In fact, version 4 of TreeMaker could solve for crease patterns that I couldn\u2019t construct by any other way \u2014 by which I mean, using pencil and paper.",
              "I (and at this writing, most other composers of technical origami) have usually designed my/our compositions on paper using the geometric concepts collectively described as \u201ccircle/river packing.",
              "\u201d (Those concepts are described in my book, Origami Design Secrets;",
              "see its page for details.)",
              "No computer is needed for this type of design;",
              "one simply sketches circles and the crease patterns known as molecules, constructs the crease pattern, and folds away.",
              "Occasionally a bit of algebra is needed to work out an initial reference point or two (see ReferenceFinder for more on this).",
              "TreeMaker allows one to set up quite elaborate relationships between flaps, their lengths, and their angles: far more complex relationships than are possible using pencil-and-paper origami design.",
              "Which meant that it was now possible, with TreeMaker, to solve for origami bases that truly were more complicated than anything a person could design by hand.",
              "The flip side of this power is: these complex crease patterns are extremely difficult to fold.",
              "Since all you\u2019re given is the crease pattern, it\u2019s up to you to devise a step-by-step folding sequence for all the creases, and the subsequent assembly into a base can also be fiendishly difficult.",
              "But the value of TreeMaker is that it combines novelty with efficiency: the patterns constructed are commonly the most efficient solutions possible for a given stick figure, and they are just as often totally new structures in the world of origami.",
              "And that opens up another question: if you are an origami composer (or wish to be), do you need to use TreeMaker?",
              "The answer is: absolutely not.",
              "The vast majority of the world\u2019s composers of technical origami don\u2019t use it;",
              "in fact, I don\u2019t use it for the majority of my own designs.",
              "What I do use it for is for what you might call \u201crapid prototyping\u201d;",
              "quickly examining 3 or 4 (or 5 or 10) different general arrangements of flaps in a base before settling on one particular configuration as the focus of my design.",
              "For that purpose, it\u2019s an invaluable tool in my arsenal.",
              "And for several of my designs, notably the Scorpion varileg, Opus 379, White-Tailed Deer, Opus 550, Mule Deer, Opus 421, and Maine Lobster, Opus 447, couldn\u2019t have been designed them without it.",
              "TreeMaker is a program for the design of origami bases.",
              "You draw a stick figure of the base on the screen;",
              "each stick in the stick figure (the \u201ctree\u201d) will be represented by a flap on the base.",
              "You can also place various constraints on the flaps, forcing them to be corner, edge, or middle flaps, and/or setting up various symmetry relationships (forcing pairs of flaps to be symmetric about a line of symmetry of the paper, for example).",
              "Once you have defined the tree, TreeMaker computes the full crease pattern for a base which, when folded, will have a projection (roughly speaking, its \u201cshadow\u201d) equivalent to that specified by the defining tree.",
              "The crease pattern can be printed out, or copied and pasted into another graphics program for further processing.",
              "Crease assignment (mountain or valley) are not computed, but with a few simple rules and some exploration by hand, the proper crease assignment can usually easily be found.",
              "In recent years, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with Professor Erik Demaine and Martin L.",
              "Demaine at MIT on various aspects of the mathematical theory of origami.",
              "One problem we have attacked has been the challenge of computing the full crease pattern for a TreeMaker base, and the related (and much harder) problem of proving that the algorithms of tree theory always give a correct solution (i.",
              "e., a flat-foldable base), or if they don\u2019t, under what circumstances they do.",
              "In my initial development of tree theory, I had found early versions of TreeMaker to be an invaluable tool for testing and exploring mathematical concepts, and so in 2003 I set out to update TreeMaker to use in this further exploration.",
              "The crease assignment problem is deceptively challenging, because we can identify most of the creases by simple inspection: The problem is, we don\u2019t know which of the axial creases are mountain and which are valley.",
              "And the last family of crease \u2014 hinge creases \u2014 were completely unspecified.",
              "Fortunately, one could almost always find the crease assignment very quickly by experimenting by folding the pattern produced by TreeMaker 4, but it was an annoying lingering hole in the theory that I desperately wanted to plug.",
              "Although it turned out to be far more complicated than I\u2019d originally imagined, by late 2005, I had an algorithm for full crease pattern generation that worked for a wide range of structures and that was implemented in TreeMaker 5.",
              "Over the same period, I migrated the code base from an Apple Macintosh-specific GUI based on Metrowerks PowerPlant to the cross-platform class library wxWidgets, which offered the promise \u2014 now realized \u2014 of fully cross-platform versions of TreeMaker: this last accomplished with the invaluable assistance of Brazilian programmer Carlos Furuti for GNU/Linux porting and Polish programmer and wxWidgets team member Wlodzimierz \u2018ABX\u2019 Skiba for Windows porting (not to mention all-around help and advice on programming and wxWidgets from both of them).",
              "One more nice development was that although CFSQP was incredibly faster than my own hand-rolled optimization code, the roughly 1000x improvement in numerical computing speeds over the last decade meant that my own optimization code was now fast enough.",
              "This meant that I could release the full TreeMaker code.",

              "g., forcing particular crease angles).",
              "What TreeMaker 5 adds to the mix is: The figure to the right shows TreeMaker 5\u2018s take on the scorpion design shown above, with the complete mountain/valley-assigned crease pattern, the folded form of the base, and the new \u201cInspector\u201d window for editing the tree and its conditions.",

              "E\u0301ric Joisel (15 November 1956 \u2013 10 October 2010) was a French origami artist who specialized in the wet-folding method, creating figurative art sculptures using sheets of paper and water, without the use of any adhesive or scissors.",
              "[1][2][3][4][5] Joisel was born on 15 November 1956, in Montmorency, Val-d'Oise, a commune in the northern suburbs of Paris, and focused his education on history and law before turning to art.",
              "His initial experiences in the art world were in sculpting, using the traditional forms of clay and stone.",
              "He first discovered in the 1980s the unique forms created with paper by Akira Yoshizawa, the Japanese grandmaster of origami who had created more than 50,000 models, developing the wet-folding method that allowed for the creation of three-dimensional rounded sculptures.",
              "Joisel was taken by the way the Yoshizawa's works blended classical origami methods and standard forms of sculpture in order to make expressive figures out of wet paper, without making any cuts or using any glue.",
              "[6] Joisel shifted to working with paper in the 1990s, devoting the remainder of his career to creating origami art using his own self-taught variation of the wet-folding techniques that Yoshizawa had developed and refined.",
              "[6] He devoted his life to origami after losing his job as the manager of a printing company.",
              "[7] Living in a small home, he devoted hours focusing on the meticulous design and detail of each piece of origami.",
              "He could spend as much as years working out the plans for one of his original origami pieces, with a single piece created over a period of days or weeks, involving hundreds of precisely planned and executed folds to sheets of paper that could measure to as much as 15 feet (4.",
              "6 m) by 25 feet (7.",
              "6 m) to create figures that ranged from the size of one's hand to life size, while many were no more than 12 inches (30 cm) high.",
              "Though his work was displayed at the Muse\u0301e du Louvre and collectors from around the world paid as much as thousands of dollars for some of his origami sculptures, the tremendous amount of time that he devoted to each work meant that he didn't earn much income.",
              "Themed pieces that he handcrafted included figures from commedia dell'arte and foot-high sculptures of musicians each holding a finely detailed musical instrument.",
              "[6][8][9] Joisel published many of the design plans for his figures, providing a look into the extraordinary level of detail and precision that \"renders his art simultaneously approachable and unattainable\".",
              "In his obituary, The New York Times included instructions on how to duplicate one of Joisel's figures of a rat, though it noted that \"no lay person should even contemplate the hedgehog\".",

              "The wet folding process allows a model to retain a curved shape more easily.",
              "It also reduces substantially any bad creases.",
              "Finally, wet folding allows rigidity once the model is dry.",
