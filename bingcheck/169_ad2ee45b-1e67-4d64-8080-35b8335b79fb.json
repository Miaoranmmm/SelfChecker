    "response": "Hello, this is Bing. I'm glad you asked me about autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are conditions where your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's cells instead of protecting them from invaders like bacteria or viruses[^1^]. There are over 100 known autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, Crohn's disease and type 1 diabetes[^1^].\n\nThe most effective way to treat and manage autoimmune diseases depends on the type and severity of the condition, but generally involves reducing inflammation and other symptoms, and controlling the immune response in your body[^2^]. There is no permanent cure for autoimmune diseases, but some common treatments include:\n\n- Over-the-counter (OTC) therapies: These are medications that do not require prescriptions and can help with mild symptoms like pain, fever or swelling. Examples are aspirin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen[^2^].\n- Prescription medications: These are medications that require prescriptions and can help with more severe symptoms like anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep problems or skin problems. Examples are corticosteroids, methotrexate or cyclosporine[^2^].\n- Immunosuppressant therapies: These are medications that target different parts of your immune system and suppress its activity. They can help protect your organs from damage and reduce inflammation. Examples are low-dose chemotherapy or drugs to prevent organ rejection after transplants[^2^].\n- Lifestyle changes: These are changes that you can make to improve your overall health and well-being. They can help reduce stress, improve your mood, boost your energy and prevent complications. Examples are eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, quitting smoking or avoiding alcohol[^2^].\n- Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM): These are therapies that are not part of conventional medicine but may offer some benefits for some people with autoimmune diseases. They can help with relaxation, pain relief or symptom management. Examples are acupuncture, massage, yoga or herbal remedies[^2^].\n- Experimental treatments: These are treatments that are still being researched and tested for safety and effectiveness. They may offer new hope for some people with autoimmune diseases who do not respond well to other treatments. Examples are stem cell therapy, gene therapy or biologic drugs[^2^].\n\nSome recent advancements in the field of autoimmune disease treatment include:\n\n- Developing new biologic drugs that target specific molecules involved in the immune system's attack on the body's cells. These drugs may be more effective and have fewer side effects than traditional immunosuppressants[^3^].\n- Using precision medicine to tailor treatments based on the individual's genetic makeup, environmental factors and disease characteristics. This may help identify the best treatment options for each person and avoid unnecessary or harmful treatments[^4^].\n- Finding new ways to diagnose autoimmune diseases earlier and more accurately using biomarkers, imaging techniques or artificial intelligence. This may help prevent irreversible damage to the organs and tissues and improve the prognosis of the disease[^4^].\n\nI hope this information was helpful to you. If you have any questions or concerns about your health, please consult your doctor or healthcare provider.",

              "Other mainstay therapeutics included agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, sodium aurothiomalate (gold salts), sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, d-penicillamine and mycophenolate;",
              "however, their clinical application was rarely properly defined in terms of immune specificity, or indeed in terms of underlying disease pathogenesis1.",
              "These agents were used in sequence, or in combination, with considerable caution arising from a significant adverse event burden.",
              "Clinical outcomes were modest at best, as judged by modern ambitions \u2014 partial responder and non-responder populations were common, and remission was rarely achieved.",
              "Long-term disability was, sadly, the expected norm across IMIDs.",
              "Two critical advances presaged a transformed landscape.",
              "A new paradigm of biotherapeutic innovation based on key pathogenic disease mechanisms was pioneered, initially with cytokine blockade and the groundbreaking application of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors in the treatment of RA2,3.",
              "This brought about rapid changes in the advent of immune-targeted therapeutics, both biological and, more recently, small-molecule-based therapeutics, targeting a wide range of cytokines and their receptors, inflammatory cell trafficking pathways and cell regulatory ligand pairs, and the application of cell depletion strategies.",
              "This expanding diversity of biological and small-molecule therapies occurred alongside a second significant advance: the recognition that strict control of inflammation is critical to disease outcome.",
              "Substantial strategic changes thus occurred in the clinical approach to IMID management, with increased emphasis on early diagnosis and intervention, followed by the goal to achieve remission or low-disease activity states, while preventing target organ damage and thereby positively impacting both quality of life and longevity4,5.",
              "Many important lessons were learnt in the early days of biological drug development for IMIDs (Fig.",
              "1).",
              "Cell depletion approaches, for example using monoclonal antibodies directed against T cells (specific for CD3, CD4 or CDw52 (alemtuzumab)), showed promise in open-label studies, but in controlled trial designs these approaches consistently failed6,7, in contrast to experiences in the transplantation and cancer fields.",
              "This may have been due in part to the failure to deplete relevant T cells within inflamed sites such as synovial tissues, with emergence of dominant clonotypes, as was demonstrated in trials in RA with alemtuzumab8,9, or to the depletion of protective regulatory T cell subsets.",
              "Such results prompted a re-evaluation of pathogenesis models, in particular concerning the predominance of adaptive immune mechanisms and functionally discrete T cell subsets in driving the established phase of IMIDs.",
              "In parallel, a rethinking of trial design, with meticulous attention to development of novel composite outcome measures, permitted refined evaluation of clinical efficacy in IMIDs.",
              "Thereafter, the notion, arising from earlier studies in sepsis, that functional redundancy in cytokine biology would obviate the success of targeted immune interventions against specific cytokines, was utterly refuted in the clinic.",
              "This is best exemplified in the application of TNF and IL-1 inhibitors in RA and shortly thereafter in IBD2,3,10.",
              "Whereas in the 1990s the perceived immune functional profile of the TNF and IL-1 pathways was similar (both cytokines were present in disease tissue and appeared viable as targets in in vivo disease models), TNF inhibitors, but not IL-1 inhibitors, were highly successful in clinical application in RA.",
              "These results demonstrated that, although IL-1 is a cytokine of functional importance in animal models of RA, its role in perpetuating inflammation is less critical than that of TNF in human RA, and that targeting TNF alone is a highly effective approach.",
              "The idea that IL-1 was an inferior therapeutic target that lacked hierarchical dominance was later refuted when IL-1 inhibitors were successfully developed to treat monogenic autoinflammatory disorders such as Muckle\u2013Wells syndrome and, thereafter, inflammasome-driven diseases such as gout11,12.",
              "A core pathogenic role for IL-1 in these latter conditions is now well understood.",

              "The concept of public pathways was clear in the application of TNF inhibitors across a range of disorders, including axial SpA, IBD, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) (see, for example, refs13,14).",
              "Once again, however, lessons were learnt from the failures of this strategy, and the existence of private pathways of disease was also recognized.",
              "For example, whereas IL-6 receptor and IL-6 inhibition were successful in RA and vasculitis, this approach failed in psoriasis and axial SpA.",
              "IL-17A inhibition was efficacious in psoriasis, PsA and axial SpA, but not in RA nor IBD (see, for example, refs15,16,17).",
              "Indeed, IL-17A inhibition may result in disease exacerbation in IBD, informing an important barrier function in the gut, which is independent of local IL-23p19 expression, as inhibition of IL-23p19 is more likely anti-inflammatory18.",
              "Such studies in turn provoked notions of a hierarchy of diseases defined by central immune pathways \u2014 a molecular taxonomy of sorts for IMIDs19.",
              "In parallel with lessons learnt regarding specific targeting of immune pathways in IMIDs, it was recognized that the best disease outcomes occur when inflammation is completely controlled.",
              "The field thus moved to early and aggressive use of targeted therapies to control inflammation5,20.",
              "Such an approach prevents irreversible tissue damage, as has been demonstrated in the tight control of inflammation in RA and protection from the subsequent destruction of joint cartilage and bone.",
              "Indeed, it has also become evident that when tissue damage does occur, such as erosion of the articular bone seen in RA, repair of the damaged bone is possible, but only in settings in which inflammation is rigorously controlled21.",
              "The current state of the art in IMID therapeutics thus seeks high response rates and remission for a significant proportion of patients, achieved against an acceptable toxicity burden.",
              "These ambitious targets have been achieved to variable levels across the rheumatic IMIDs, but much unmet need remains.",
              "There is increasing recognition that IMIDs should be defined on the basis of their absolute immunological activity state, rather than on the level of disease activity relative to a prior timepoint (defined by transient response to an intervention).",
              "By this means, an IMID might be classified as active with no therapy, in a residual activation state despite (a range of) interventions or in remission, either drug-maintained or drug-free.",
              "Studies of drug-free and drug-maintained remission offer particular possibilities in terms of identifying immunological pathways associated with persistence of disease in the absence of clinical manifestations.",
              "For example, molecular analyses of \u2018cleared psoriasis\u2019 plaques after treatment with IL-17A inhibitors or TNF inhibitors do not reveal molecular normality, but rather demonstrate evidence of a healed state22.",
              "Mucosal biopsy samples of resolved colonic lesions similarly exhibit pathways associated with a regulatory or \u2018restrained\u2019 state23.",
              "With use of a similar approach, a subset of macrophages positive for tyrosine-protein kinase Mer (MERTK) and CD206 has been described in synovial biopsy samples from patients with RA in clinical remission that is associated with a long-term disease-free state24.",
              "A final key lesson has been the recognition that if IMIDs are controlled early and aggressively with achievement of immunological remission, we can begin to successfully reduce and, even in some cases, eliminate therapies in the short term25.",
              "However, in most cases, disease will recur.",
              "Thus, a fundamental change in the underlying immunological process has not been fully realized;",
              "rather, the disease has been successfully suppressed.",
              "Earlier use of biological agents is more efficacious than late disease intervention.",
              "The reason for this is not yet clear but it could reflect a more tractable clinical state in early disease, with less target organ damage and therefore enhanced residual potential for recovery.",
              "It is, however, possible that this clinical observation speaks to an evolving immunological pathogenic predominance over time in IMIDs.",
              "It is well accepted that different immune pathways operate over the course of an infectious disease and perhaps, as organ damage accumulates, we should explore similar models in IMIDs over time, with sequential use of targeted therapeutics arising in consequence.",
              "Moreover, in terms of strategic intervention, there is a move from early intervention to the interception of disease at a phase of \u2018predisease\u2019.",
              "This is particularly exciting in the area of psoriasis, where approximately 30% of patients will go on to develop PsA and other related axial SpA phenomena and in whom, in theory, appropriate immune therapeutic intervention could be preventive.",
              "Similar options arise with the identification of \u2018pre-RA\u2019, which is loosely defined on the basis of genetic risk factors, family history and the presence of circulating autoantibodies recognizing altered post-transcriptionally modified peptides26.",

              "Intriguing recent evidence in patients with RA of CD45\u2212CD31\u2212PDPN+ pre-inflammatory mesenchymal cells, the appearance of which in peripheral blood immediately precedes clinical flare, would be consistent with such a model53.",
              "Just as the initial IMID revolution was supported by altered strategic approaches, so too will be the next phase, the phase of molecular revolution, which will capitalize on the application of (epi)genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic methods.",
              "Such methods are being extensively tested for their ability to predict the natural history of disease, optimal therapeutic selection and likely adverse event profiles for individuals with IMIDs.",
              "Early progress is being made through analysis of blood and especially through tissue-based approaches in RA, psoriasis and IBD54.",
              "Thus far, we lack critical validation of this molecular approach but are optimistic of its long-term success.",
              "A further strategic advance will concern the adoption of strategies that induce remission and then maintenance, which may arise from the identification of immune or stromal pathways associated with clinical remission states in IMIDs.",
              "This approach is considered the standard of care in oncology yet has been less embraced in IMID therapeutics;",
              "perhaps the increasing range of available mechanisms of action and formal association of certain mechanisms with identifiable clinical states and immunological status will be permissive in this regard.",
              "Do we yet have the confidence to develop immune-targeting medicines that will work \u2018only\u2019 in a remission/maintenance context?",
              "A significant challenge remains the reliable assessment of immune states \u2014 an \u2018immunological stethoscope\u2019 \u2014 the development of which would be an exciting advance.",
              "A final consequence of this high-fidelity resolution of disease pathogenesis will be to underpin future rational combinations of immune-targeted therapeutics in IMIDs.",
              "As we move increasingly to electronic health records, the era of \u2018big data\u2019 in health and associated assembly of large biobanks, further potential lies in the comparisons that are now possible across IMIDs.",
              "There are now large, well-characterized biobanks for IMIDs that are ripe for comparative analysis to better define those immune pathways that are commonly engaged, or are lacking in the case of regulators, across IMIDs and those that may offer more disease-specific potential.",
              "As an example, the IMID-Bio-UK metaconsortium (see \u2018Related links\u2019), which includes data from diseases such as RA, PsA, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjo\u0308gren syndrome, primary biliary cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis, confers such potential.",
              "Interrogation of data from such metaconsortia will allow the discovery or validation of identified pathways before embarking on clinical trials.",
              "It is encouraging that even clinical trials are rapidly evolving to include extensive in silico testing of new agents before clinical introduction55.",
              "In parallel, the creation of biobanks associated with phase II/III clinical trials should allow greater mechanistic interrogation of such clinical cohorts to offer insights as well as clinical efficacy data.",
              "The \u2018holy grail\u2019 in the IMID field remains the restoration of immune homeostasis.",
              "It is unclear whether this will be possible on the basis of our current understanding of the underlying network dysfunction in IMIDs that sustains the breach of tolerance, especially in the context of existing tissue damage.",
              "Numerous interesting approaches are focused particularly on expanding regulatory T cell subsets (such as with IL-2), introducing tolerogenic dendritic cells and other approaches48,49.",
              "Another emerging avenue is the use of chimeric antigen receptor T cells directed against B cells in autoantibody-producing diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus56.",
              "In addition, myeloablative autologous stem cell transplantation has been used effectively for fatal diseases such as systemic sclerosis57 and may be useful in other IMIDs.",
              "A further intriguing opportunity lies in characterization of the molecular pathways that underpin the development of immune-related adverse events following checkpoint inhibitor administration for cancer.",
              "This provides a \u2018natural experiment\u2019 in which regulatory checkpoints are bypassed and subsequent self-tissue damage and the mechanisms involved can be evaluated in real time, with the onset of insult precisely known58.",
              "Finally, as the upstream pathways that drive IMIDs are increasingly recognized (for example, with roles for the microbiome and for smoking in pulmonary lesions in RA), there will be more opportunities for preventative approaches.",
              "IMID therapeutics have been transformed \u2014 from the worst of times to the best of times \u2014 representing a remarkable success story for the application of modern molecular medicine driven by an ambitious and increasingly integrated experimental medicine field.",
              "However, we still do not achieve remission in sufficient numbers of patients with IMIDs, organ integrity is not always preserved and tissue repair is not typically achieved.",
              "Quality of life remains suboptimal for many patients, especially for those with complex rheumatic diseases and those with neurological IMIDs.",

              "Your treatment options usually involve reducing inflammation and other symptoms. Once you have been diagnosed, some autoimmune diseases can be difficult to treat.",
              "You may need to try different options before finding the right combination that works for you.",
              "In general, treatment usually cannot cure the disease, but it may reduce symptoms and help you manage the condition better.",
              "Specific treatments will vary depending on the type of autoimmune condition you have and its severity.",
              "However, most treatments fall into one of the categories below: Shana Novak / Getty Images Over-the-counter (OTC) therapies do not require prescriptions and may be some of the first treatments your healthcare provider recommends for an autoimmune disease.",
              "Usually, OTC medications help relieve mild symptoms, such as pain.",
              "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help with inflammation, swelling, stiffness, fever, and pain.",
              "Common OTC drugs include: The right OTC medication will depend on the type of autoimmune disease you have and how far the condition has progressed.",
              "Your healthcare provider may have you try different OTC drugs.",
              "Some people need only OTC therapies to manage their disorders, but NSAIDs do pose some risks.",
              "If you have severe symptoms or OTC therapies are not working, you may need to take prescription drugs for autoimmune disorders.",
              "These medications can help with different symptoms like fever, pain, anxiety, swelling, depression, fatigue, sleep problems, skin problems, rashes, or digestive issues.",
              "Prescription drugs usually cost more than OTC medications, and they may have more side effects.",

              "Immunosuppressive biologics include: Side Effects Immunosuppressant medicines are often considered a gold-standard treatment for many conditions, but they can come with major side effects.",

              "Additionally, some drugs for treating autoimmune diseases have fatigue as a side effect.",
              "Your healthcare provider may need to adjust your medications if fatigue is a serious problem.",
              "Medicines for treating fatigue include: Since there is a wide range of autoimmune diseases, your medications will vary based on the condition you have and your specific symptoms. For example, you may need to take substances, such as insulin or thyroid hormone replacement drugs, to replace what is missing in your body because of an autoimmune condition.",
              "Other treatment options that may help include: Lifestyle changes can help you manage an autoimmune disease.",
              "Since most medical treatment options do not offer a cure, lifestyle modifications can be an important part of helping you feel better.",
              "The goal of making these changes is to lower inflammation in the body and control other symptoms. Keep in mind that making and sticking to lifestyle changes can take time and effort.",
              "Your healthcare provider can make recommendations, but you must be willing to alter how you live.",
              "Consider asking friends and family to help keep you accountable.",

              "Yet there is a measure of order in that miniscule, infinitesimal corner of phenomena that begs for clarification and solid attempts to create order from the chaos.",
              "Such was the world of comparative immunology in the early 60s when the parent field of immunology was budding into the giant sequoia of a discipline that it is today.",
              "There was essentially one model the eternal mouse whose spleen seemed to provide the essence of immunology!",
              "How did it all get started and how did that somewhat fortuitous birth provide succor for a field that could approach CAM.",
              "Entering CAM with an evidence-based approach was therefore as much of a fruitful and fulfilling challenge as trying to probe convincingly the existence of innate immunity in earthworms (1,2).",
              "Invertebrates possess elements of both non-specific and specific immune responses.",
              "Although these concepts have been subjected to intense scrutiny, these two elements are often controversial.",
              "One point of contention, perhaps the chief, may be traced to the earliest history of immunology that was rooted first in the humoral system.",
              "A commonly held belief concerning the immune system is that its progressive, phylogenetic development paralleled the appearance of immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors (TCR) in vertebrates.",
              "If this is true, the entire animal kingdom can be divided according to this narrow view: (i) invertebrates that produce only nonspecific reactions by leukocytes and humoral components;",
              "(ii) vertebrates that additionally show specific responses through T cells and B cells that destroy cancers and synthesize immunoglobulins.",
              "Because the cell-mediated immune response appears to be prototypic, it may deserve newer approaches in order to reveal increasing and progressive levels of differentiation, especially when invertebrates are considered.",
              "Thus strict demarcations seem blurred.",
              "With respect to immunity, there has always been the dominant anthropocentric theme starting most vividly at the end of the 18th century with Jenner's attempts at vaccination.",
              "No one really investigated the universality of mechanisms or the possible existence or at least importance of beings other than humans, not at least with respect to immunology.",
              "However, the current status of immunity can be described using two general terms: cellular immunity and humoral immunity.",
              "These two great camps are in turn subdivided into innate immunity and adaptive immunity.",
              "Innate immunity is characteristically non-specific, natural non-anticipatory, non-clonal and germline.",
              "On the other hand, adaptive immunity is specific, induced anticipatory, clonal and somatic.",
              "Each of these terms defines particular attributes and when compared represents distinct underlying mechanisms. Invertebrates are considered to possess cells and molecules that almost exclusively effect only innate responses.",
              "Vertebrates retained this innate response but also evolved the adaptive response.",
              "Metchnikoff's contribution was also instrumental in forging the discipline of comparative immunology, a branch of immunology that investigates the evolution of immune mechanisms by experimentation using different animal species.",
              "Invertebrate immunology is considered a subdiscipline of this since it deals with several related features.",
              "First, there is the need to understand the basis of innate, natural, non-specific, non-anticipatory and non-clonal responses, which is the only response of invertebrates according to current evidence.",
              "Second, a thorough understanding of diverse mechanisms is essential if we are to define the various steps in the evolutionary development of the invertebrate type of response and its relationship to that of vertebrates.",
              "In addition to this invertebrate immune system, with progressive and more complicated evolutionary steps, a more intricate system appeared in vertebrates: the highly evolved and presumably more advanced adaptive, induced, specific, anticipatory and clonal responses.",
              "Third, invertebrate immune systems are of interest as experimental subjects because, by revealing their immune response characteristics, we can better comprehend environmental forces that may have influenced the evolution of immune systems. Clearly the most prominent force was probably the survival of a species by virtue of having evolved an immune system (2,3).",
              "Now from a famous editorial for the journal, Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine (eCAM) we have the musings of what is appropriate for creating this linkage between the immune system and CAM.",
              "\u2018As a developmental immunobiologist, interested in origins and foundations, I am of course steeped in the beginnings of modern immunology.",
              "Let us deal in a bit of musing juxtaposing immunology, science and CAM.",

              "Lessons from Immunology\u2019.",
              "According to Burnet (See 4): The first objective in a serious approach to immunology should be to obtain a broad understanding, with a minimum of detail, of how immunology fits into the pattern of biology\u2014of the way in which the immune system evolved, its function and coordination with other body systems, and its development from the embryo onwards.",
              "At the same time, such an outline should provide an adequate background for easy application of immunological ideas to the detail of practical immunological work in public health, clinical, and veterinary practice.",
              "Would it be possible to paraphrase this statement in the context of eCAM so that it reads: \u2018the first objective in a serious approach to CAM should be to obtain a broad understanding, with a minimum of detail, of how CAM fits into the pattern of biology\u2014of the way in which the neuroendocrineimmune system evolved, its function and coordination with other body systems, and its development from the embryo onwards.",
              "At the same time, such an outline should provide an adequate background for easy application of CAM ideas to the detail of practical CAM work in public health, clinical and medical practice, and yet not stray far away from the very biology that under girds it.",
              "CAM is organismic, inclusive and not exclusive (4).",
              "Now it is appropriate to turn to the next question.",
              "Does any of this fit?",
              "So how do we define CAM?",
              "Readers may be wondering just what is complementary medicine and what is alternative medicine?",
              "Several definitions may be offered based on different points of view and those in turn influenced by professional training, practice and, perhaps, the dictates of funding agencies.",
              "The discipline is a heterogeneous subject, to say the least, and it is unlikely that all the adherent disciplines that are sheltered by the umbrella of CAM will carry equal weight or influence or can be subjected to the same rigors of scientific inquiry.",
              "Some of these generalizations apply to all disciplines, including those subdisciplines that fall under the aegis of the immunology umbrella.",
              "However, perhaps CAM is ripe for an infusion of empiricism.",
              "Modern immunology, like CAM, has its earliest roots in concerns for health and disease, but immunology never seemed to have been branded with the aura that often shrouds CAM.",
              "There were always a group of experimentalists and, perforce, the necessity to use animal models with which experimentation could be performed to test hypotheses (5).",
              "Once eCAM was launched there was a beginning flurry of works devoted to immunity and CAM.",
              "The interesting twist concerned an area that seemed to have been the bridge between what was truly primitive of Metchnikoff's heyday and what is truly immune.",
              "Enter therefore and only naturally, the NK cell.",
              "According to Takeda and Okumura (5,6) it has been well known since ancient times that CAM, including exercise, provides a lot of benefit to health.",
              "Many CAM modalities are believed to prevent or even cure diseases, especially morbid ones such as cancer and aging (7,8,9,10).",
              "However, until recently conventional medicine has largely rejected the use of CAM agents because little biological evidence has been provided for the functional mechanisms of many of them.",
              "For the past few decades, many modern scientific researchers have rediscovered the value of CAM.",
              "Modulation of immune functions by CAM agents is the mechanism most widely analyzed and has been suggested to provide some scientific evidence for the biological effects of various CAM agents.",
              "Specifically, evidence for up-regulation of natural killer (NK) cell numbers and/or NK cell cytotoxicity by these agents has been accumulating.",
              "NK cells have been well established as innate cytotoxic effector cells for self-defense in both vertebrates and invertebrates, in both of which they may use similar mechanisms in the lysis of target cells.",
              "Takeda and Okumura (1) further point out that ever since Macfarlane Burnet proposed the immune surveillance hypothesis against tumor development, the concept has been a hot focus of debate for more than 40 years.",
              "The original immune surveillance hypothesis was challenged because nude mice lacking T cells did not show a higher incidence of cancer than did syngenic immunocompetent mice.",
              "However, this contradictory conclusion is now taken as fine evidence that innate immunity is in the critical arms of immune surveillance against tumor development.",
              "Moreover, in the innate immune system NK cells, which do not express TCR that recognize specific peptides presented on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), rather than T cells, seem well suited for this role.",
              "NK cells thus mediating natural cytotoxicity are composed predominantly of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) and some of small agranular lymphocytes, both of which express CD16 and CD56, but no T-cell receptor on the cell surface.",
              "NK cells can induce cytolysis in the absence of MHC class I antigen expression on their target cells.",
              "This phenomenon is commonly understood according to the \u2018missing self\u2019 hypothesis.",
              "Culture of NK cells with some cytokines augments their cytotoxic activity so that they become able to induce cytolysis for a wide spectrum of cells, including tumor cells expressing autologous MHC class I.",
              "They are now called lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, although LAK cells are also induced by T lymphocytes.",
              "For the past few decades, scientific investigations on CAM have remarkably advanced and partly supported their medical efficacy through preclinical and clinical experiments.",
              "Here is reviewed briefly information from Takeda and Okumura (5,6).",
              "Such CAM modalities include: Oriental medicine, especially traditional Chinese medicine (including Kampo and acupuncture), extract products from natural plants, animal molecules and live lactic acid bacteria.",
              "In particular, many investigators have suggested that NK cell activation is one of the critical mechanisms for the biological effects induced by various CAM agents.",
              "For example, intake of green tea and some kind of live lactic acid bacteria enhanced NK cell activity.",
              "Administration of extracts from ginseng, aged garlic, Viscum album (mistletoe), Cichorium intybus, Echinacea purpurea root, Derris scandens hydroalcholic, some wild plants, Chinese herbs and some kinds of mushrooms significantly augmented NK cytotoxicity or restored NK cell activity in some immune-suppressive conditions.",
              "Some of these agents showed inhibition of experimental metastasis of cancer.",
              "Oral administration of Phyllanthus emblica, which is known as an excellent source of vitamin C, enhanced NK cell activity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), thus, supplemental nutriments might enhance NK cell activity.",
              "Moreover, acupuncture, skin rubdown, relaxation, massage therapy, music therapy, mirthful laughter and hypnotherapy enhanced NK cell activity and/or NK cell numbers.",
              "There are a considerable numbers of studies reporting that acute and chronic exercise and long-term repeated exercise (training effects) elevated NK cell activity in peripheral blood.",
              "In 1998, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) was established by the US Congress at the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) to investigate CAM modalities rigorously in order to determine which are beneficial and worthy of further consideration for mainstream practice.",
              "Among the many CAM approaches that warrant careful investigation are those that claim to sustain, restore or boost immunity.",
              "In this review, Goldrosen and Strauss covered the following topics: use of CAM, regulation of CAM, risks of CAM use, clinical trials of CAM, CAM and immunity, dietary supplements and mind\u2013body approaches.",
