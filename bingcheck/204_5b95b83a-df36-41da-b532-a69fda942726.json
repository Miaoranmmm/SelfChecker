I can try to explain the process and technology behind the development of autonomous vehicles, and what potential implications and impacts they will have on transportation systems and society as a whole.\n\nAutonomous vehicles (AVs) use technology to partially or entirely replace the human driver in navigating a vehicle from an origin to a destination while avoiding road hazards and responding to traffic conditions[^1^]. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed a widely-adopted classification system with six levels based on the level of human intervention[^1^].\n\nAVs use combinations of technologies and sensors to sense the roadway, other vehicles, and objects on and along the roadway[^2^]. They use sensors, actuators, algorithms, machine learning, and processors to create and maintain a map of their surroundings and communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure[^3^].\n\nAVs have the potential to significantly impact society by providing driverless mobility to a broad range of people, from door to door. Not only those who are currently able to drive a vehicle, but also those who don\u2019t due to physical, psychological or other conditions will be affected by this new technology[^4^].\n\nAVs may also offer benefits such as increased safety, reduced congestion, enhanced comfort, lower carbon emissions, and more efficient use of road space[^4^] [^5^] [^6^]. However, they also pose challenges such as regulation, liability, public perception, infrastructure adaptation, cybersecurity, ethical dilemmas, and social equity[^4^] [^5^] [^6^].\n\nAVs may also have secondary effects on various sectors such as insurance, car repair, logistics, retail, commerce, and others that depend on or are related to transportation[^4^] [^5^]. The extent and direction of these impacts are uncertain and depend on many factors such as the level of automation, the rate of adoption, the mode of ownership, the policy environment, and the consumer behavior[^5^] [^6^].\n\nI hope this helps you understand the basics of autonomous vehicles and their potential impacts.

              "For example, a coordinating autonomous vehicle already on a highway could adjust its speed to make room for a merging car, eliminating a risky merging situation altogether.",
              "The team substantiated the potential to safely scale remote supervision in two theorems. First, using a mathematical framework known as queuing theory, the researchers formulated an expression to capture the probability of a given number of supervisors failing to handle all merges pooled together from multiple cars.",

              "What are these terms?",
              "That was one of the more important changes we made in this version, and it was one of the thorniest issues that we tackled with the ISO-SAE group.",
              "It was particularly important for companies working on ADS-dedicated vehicles operating in geofenced urban areas to distinguish between remote driving and remote assistance.",
              "Consider the need for an ADS-dedicated vehicle to, for example, pass a double-parked vehicle that is blocking its lane, where passing it requires crossing a double-yellow line to enter a lane of opposing traffic: the vehicle would signal a person in the fleet operations center of its predicament and that person will either remotely drive the vehicle using, for example, the vehicle\u2019s cameras and a joy-stick apparatus wirelessly linked to the vehicle\u2019s steering and braking controls to accomplish the passing maneuver.",
              "Or, remotely assist the vehicle by sending it instructions to accomplish the passing maneuver in its own.",
              "The first example constitutes remote-driving and means that the ADS-dedicated vehicle in question is Level 3, while the second example constitutes remote assistance and means that the ADS-dedicated vehicle in question is Level 4.",
              "The SAE press release also notes that the update does not include driver warning and momentary driver-intervention systems in the classification of these levels.",
              "For some, this may relate to the recent Tesla crash in Texas that prompted policymakers to call for driver monitoring even in the lower SAE levels.",
              "Actually, J3016 clarifies that stand-alone crash avoidance features equipped on conventional vehicles without ADS, such as automatic emergency braking, electronic stability control, and blind spot intervention, are subsumed by an ADS whenever one is engaged.",
              "Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, however, is not an ADS, but a Level 2 driver support feature.",
              "And the preliminary NTSB investigation apparently proved that Autopilot was not engaged during the crash in question, although adaptive cruise control was.",
              "Regarding driver monitoring systems, Tesla has been using a steering wheel-based system that looks for hand contact and wheel torque as an indication of driver engagement in the driving task.",
              "This DMS, however, proved easy to defeat using a counterweight hung on the steering wheel, and otherwise allowed a driver to rely on Autopilot\u2019s ability to maintain lane position \u2013 and to even leave the driver\u2019s seat, as some users did.",
              "However, in late May, Tesla announced that it will start using an already-equipped interior driver-facing camera on the Model 3 and Model Y to monitor driver compliance with Autopilot\u2019s requirement that the driver remain seated in the driver\u2019s seat, and that they maintain attention to the roadway while Autopilot is engaged.",
              "As your committee hears calls for driving-monitoring systems across the board, what\u2019s the reaction?",
              "Is it needed?",
              "Just to be clear, this J3016 document lives under the On-Road Automated Driving Committee.",
              "There\u2019s a Safety and Human Factors Steering Committee that also has a Driving Automation committee that\u2019s working on the HMI aspects of driving automation, and that group already has published a J3114 document with definitions;",
              "it\u2019s doing an update of that document as well as coming out with a new document, J3196, that will address certain guidance aspects of driver monitoring for driving-automation features.",
              "There are no Level 2 systems on the road that do not have some form of driver-monitoring system.",
              "The steering-wheel-based system that senses both torque and is touch-sensitive is the most common of these.",
              "The other type of driver-monitoring system that\u2019s favored by the NTSB is a camera-based system that detects the driver\u2019s face position, and in some cases, eye position.",
              "That system is featured on the Cadillac [GM] Super Cruise which is designed to be hands-free.",
              "Also in the SAE release on the J3016 update is the term \u2018dual-mode vehicle;",
              "\u2019 what is that?",
              "That\u2019s still a hypothetical vehicle.",
              "Nobody has designed one yet, but it\u2019s theoretically possible \u2013 it\u2019s a Level 5 vehicle owned by a private person.",
              "It can be operated by the ADS or by a human.",
              "The vehicle could be dispatched in driverless operation to, for example, pick up someone from the airport, or it could be driven as a conventional vehicle.",
              "It\u2019s dual-mode in that sense.",
              "Theoretically, it\u2019s also capable of Level 4, but the utility of a geofenced, dual-mode Level 4 vehicle might not support a business case.",
              "So it\u2019s being thought of more as a Level 5 vehicle that also is operable by a human.",
              "And the terms \u201cconventional vehicle\u201d vs. \u201cADS-dedicated vehicle,\u201d what is that distinction?",

              "These sensors use ultrasonic waves and operate in the range of 20\u201340 kHz [14].",
              "These waves are generated by a magneto-resistive membrane used to measure the distance to the object.",
              "The distance is measured by calculating the time-of-flight (ToF) of the emitted wave to the echoed signal.",

              "The sensor output is updated after every 20 ms [47], making it not compliant with the strict QoS constraints of an ITS.",
              "These sensors are directional and provide a very narrow beam detection range [14].",
              "Therefore, multiple sensors are needed to to get a full-field view.",
              "However, multiple sensors will influence each other and can cause extreme ranging errors [48].",
              "The general solution is to provide a unique signature or identification code which will be required to discard the echoes of other ultrasonic sensors operating in near-by range [49].",
              "In AVs, these sensors are utilised to measure short distances at low speeds.",
              "For example, they are used for SPA and LDWS [50].",

              "In modern vehicles, different frequency bands such as 24, 60, 77 and 79 GHz are employed and they can measure a range from 5 to 200 m [52].",
              "The distance between the AV and the object is calculated by measuring the ToF between the emitted signal and the received echo.",
              "In AVs, the RADARs use an array of micro-antennas that generate a set of lobes to improve the range resolution as well as the detection of multiple targets [53].",
              "As mm-Wave RADAR has higher penetrability and a wider bandwidth, and it can accurately measure the short-range targets in any direction utilising the variation in Doppler shift [51,52,53,54].",
              "Due to longer wavelength, mm-Wave radars have an anti-blocking and anti-pollution capability that allows them to cope in rain, snow, fog and low-light.",
              "Furthermore, mm-Wave radars have the ability to measure the relative velocity using the Doppler shift [15].",

              "One of these changes is the reduction in the vehicle ownership or increase in the vehicle utilization.",
              "Results of previous simulation models show that every single AV can replace a significant number of conventional vehicles, especially if it is used as a shared mode of transportation, which means that a lower fleet size can serve the same population with higher vehicle utilization [14, 15].",
              "Studies show significant increase in vehicle utilization from 5% in conventional vehicles [16] up to 75% [17].",
              "This increase in vehicle utilization is beneficial as it means shorter life span and adaption of newer and better technology [18].",
              "Simulations of AVs as a shared mode showed that every AV can replace more than 10 conventional vehicles [16\u201321].",
              "However, using AVs privately showed a slight reduction in the overall vehicle ownership.",

              "5 conventional vehicles.",
              "This is because of the difference in assumptions between this study and all other studies [22].",
              "All the previous studies assumed that all trips will be made by SAVs, but Moreno, Michalski, Llorca, and Moeckel (2018) study [22] mimicked the results of a survey that showed that 24% of respondents would use shared AVs.",
              "Consequently, it is more reasonable to rely on the later results (AV = 2.",
              "5 conventional vehicles) because it is not realistic to assume that 100% of the trips will be made by shared AVs (SAVs).",
              "Over time, the percentage of trips made in shared AVs might change as AV penetration increases and shared AVs prove their high performance and gains for society then the percentage of shared trips might increase and become closer to the percentages stated in the first studies (AV > = 10 conventional vehicles).",
              "Similarly, Zhang, Guhathakurta, and Khalil (2018) showed that sharing AVs between the same household members reduces the vehicle ownership by 20%, which is also a significant reduction, but modest when compared to other studies [23].",
              "In brief, AVs have the potential to reduce vehicle ownership significantly, even if it used privately.",
              "On the other hand, using AVs as a shared mode shows promising results with a significant reduction in the required fleet size to serve the same population.",
              "This reduction in fleet size is beneficial for the society and environment because it means lower emissions, better traffic conditions, much higher vehicle utilization, and shorter life span, which in turn means the adoption of newer and cleaner technology quickly.",

              "For the case of shared AVs, results show that shared AVs can provide significantly lower waiting time (5 min on average) when compared with the current transit waiting time and with significantly lower trip costs as shown in Table \u200bTable44.",
              "Summary of the studies investigating the waiting time and trip costs of SAVs In conclusion, shared AVs have the potential to significantly reduce the average waiting time and trip costs when compared with the current transit service, which means that shared AVs will be a strong competitor to the transit service and might attract public transit users.",

              "in particular, AVs will be available sooner or later.",
              "One of the biggest advantages of AVs is that passengers will be able to be engaged in other activities, which in turn means that the trip time will not be considered as economic loss [34].",

              "4 (Implications of AVs on Vehicle ownership (Fleet size) and vehicle utilization).",
              "This reduction in fleet size means better traffic conditions and mitigation of congestion.",
              "On the other hand, AVs will motivate people to make longer trips, travel further, and make additional trips which in turn increase the VKT [34, 37].",

              "Thus, it must be mentioned that the low waiting times and low trip costs of AVs might attract people to make additional trips (induced demand) and might discourage people from making trips using public transportation [37], which in turn means a significant increase in the VKT, and emissions.",
              "Moreover, this additional demand besides with the increase in the VKT might worsen the traffic conditions.",
              "Thus, AVs might not solve the congestion problem, but as mentioned before the time spent in the vehicle will not be considered as an economic loss [34] as passengers will spend their time in productive activities.",
              "In conclusion, while AVs have the potential to allow people to be engaged in productive activities during their trips (good influence from the economic perspective), AVs have the potential to motivate people to make additional trips which significantly increase the VKT and emissions (bad influence from the environmental perspective).",
              "Thus, while AVs might enhance the economic condition, they might destroy the environment.",
              "One major factor that has an impact on the public behaviour is regulations.",
              "Regulatory action will be a significant determinant on controlling the change in the public behaviour and in turn the impact of AVs.",
              "For example, regulations might allow AVs as a first mile-last mile solution to support public transit service, which guarantees the maximum benefits of AVs.",
              "AVs have the potential to reduce the distance between the vehicles (distance ahead) and to reduce the lane width [40] due to the high level of communication between vehicles and the elimination of human factors from the driving process, which in turn means a significant increase in capacity of roads as shown in Table \u200bTable66.",
              "Summary of the studies investigating the impact of AVs on the road and intersection capacity In conclusion, AVs have the potential to increase roads and intersection capacities.",
              "On the other hand, it is not expected that this increase can be achieved until a high level of market penetration [37] as with conventional driving the human factor will dominate for safety issues or for human feeling of safety as people will be sacred to see the vehicle drive close to the vehicle ahead or the vehicle beside.",
              "However, in AVs, people might be involved in other activities (sleeping, watching movies, or any other activity) and probably they will not see the surrounding roads, which might allow vehicles to drive close to each other.",

              "In the 1920s, research focused on the vehicle-to-vehicle communication system using radio waves [1].",
              "This was followed by the invention of the electromagnetic guidance system in the 1940s [2].",
              "In the 1980s, the first autonomous vehicle (AV) system was invented when Mercedes-Benz partnered with Bundeswehr University in Munich [3].",
              "The invention of the first autonomous vehicle (AV) or self-driving car was a milestone that attracted many manufacturers and since this point many companies have been competing for introducing AVs [4].",
              "According to the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration, there are 5 levels of AVs\u2019 functionality.",
              "Level 0: no automation and the driver perform all the driving tasks.",
              "Level 1: driver assistance system which means that the driver takes control of the vehicle while some driving assistance features are added to the vehicle;",
              "level 2: partial automation which means that the vehicle has an automated function, but the driver must be engaged in the driving tasks;",
              "level 3: conditional automation which means that drivers must always be ready to take control of the vehicle;",
              "level 4: high automation which means that the vehicle can drive autonomously but the driver might have the option to take control;",
              "and level 5: full automation which means that the vehicle can take control of the vehicle under all conditions [5].",
              "In the last decade, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have witnessed tremendous improvement because of the significant effort dedicated to AVs from both research and industry [6].",
              "In 2009, Google launched a project with the vision of introducing AVs by 2020 [7].",
              "Uber and Volvo introduced the third generation of their AVs and it was expected that they would test it by 2020 [8].",
              "In 2014, Apple launched its AV project \u201cTitan\u201d and they announced that their AVs will be available by 2016 but the project faced many issues and it is expected that their AVs will be available between 2023 and 2025 [9].",
              "Moreover, new startup companies launched with the vision of providing AVs.",
              "For example, Zoox was launched in 2014 and its value was increasing rapidly and reached 3.",
              "2 $ billion by 2018 [10].",
              "From cities perspective, many cities allowed AVs testing.",
              "Now, in the US, 20 states allowed the deployment and testing of AV s on their public roads [11, 12].",
              "The main point of these testing or pilot studies is to understand the implications of AVs and the attitude of the public towards AVs.",
              "Over the past few years, the implications of AVs have been discussed intensively.",
              "While AVs are expected to provide a large number of benefits, they are also associated with risks or drawbacks.",
              "It is expected that AVs will increase the level of comfort [13], improve productivity [14, 15], and improve mobility for people with limited transportation [16].",
              "On the other hand, it is expected that AVs might increase the vehicle kilometers traveled, and the level of congestion because of the extra empty trips [17].",
              "The advantages and disadvantages of autonomous technology are coexisting, and AV technology is growing rapidly as both research and industry have put significant efforts to develop AVs.",
              "While AVs are often discussed in regard to their implications, benefits, technological development, and technological challenges, less attention has been paid to the public acceptance and perception of AVs.",
              "The process of innovation diffusion may not always be smooth.",
              "For many new technologies, the non-technological issues are more likely to be a barrier toward the adoption of this technology than the technological ones, and for sure AVs are one of these technologies.",
              "IEEE reported to CNN that the \u201cbiggest barrier to pervasive adoption of driverless cars may have nothing to do with technology but will be general public acceptance.",
              "While the average driver may grasp the basic benefits of autonomous cars\u2014increased fuel efficiency and safety, along with a reduction in traffic\u2014it may not be enough to get them to let go of the steering wheel\u201d [18].",
              "Thus, the main objective of this paper is to understand and analyze the main factors that influence the public acceptance of AVs as follows: AVs safety and the influence of the perceived level of safety on the public attitude towards AVs.",

              "Previous work has primarily involved quantitative surveys.",
              "Then, the paper reveals some gaps in the literature and provides some recommendations for the future.",
              "Safety is a major pillar for the success of any new technology.",
              "While most of the previous studies assume that AVs can enhance traffic safety by more than 90% [19, 20] due to the elimination of the human error, safety studies show that other factors might replace the human error and increase the rate of collision.",
              "Additionally, safety studies show that AVs\u2019 safety is extremely complex and still in the early stages.",
              "In 2015, Sivak and Schoettle found that there are many factors which contribute to accidents and the contribution of these factors will change with the introduction of AVs.",
              "For example, while some vehicle failure might become obsolete, some other failures will show up.",
              "Lighting failure might become obsolete as vehicles will not depend on the visual input, but this might be a problem during the transition period when both conventional and autonomous vehicles share the same roads, as human drivers might not be able to see the vehicles ahead.",
              "Additionally, the complexity of the system and sensors will increase the vehicular failure rates which might increase the rate of accidents.",
              "Moreover, sometimes accidents are unavoidable.",
              "In a situation, when a person suddenly appears in front of an AV and the distance ahead is not enough to brake, the AV will not have a choice but crashing.",
              "Although AVs react faster than the human drivers as they eliminate the perception and reaction time, the braking distance might not be enough to stop [21].",
              "Aside from the vehicular failure, some other factors contribute to accidents such as the other road users.",
              "For example, at the intersection level, pedestrians were responsible for 80% of accidents [22].",
              "Finally, the behavior of AVs is unpredictable in many conditions and might be affected by the environmental and weather conditions of the surrounding area.",
              "In 2017, two studies discussed the safety of AVs.",
              "Koopman and Wagner showed that safety of AVs is a complex process that requires coordination between different disciplines starting from machine learning, to sensor development, to testing AVs, and developing a standard testing process [23].",
              "Klara focused on the main issue or challenges for realizing AVs\u2019 safety.",
              "First, there is no standard for testing AVs.",
              "For example, the use of the driving test will not be feasible for AVs, because this test will make sure that AVs have the ability to perform the basic driving tasks, while the behavior of AVs in different or complex conditions will not be tested [24].",
              "May be one good approach is the one followed by Tesla.",
              "In 2016, Tesla announced that their vehicles have the ability to drive autonomously but this feature would operate in the shadow mode in which the vehicle make decisions, but these decisions are not executed, instead the human driver actions are the actions executed [24].",
              "The main benefit of this approach is to gather information about AVs\u2019 decisions and compare these decisions with the human driver actions and train the vehicles to mimic the human drivers in the future.",
              "Also, another benefit of this approach is to test AVs and make sure whether they take the right decisions or not and how AVs learn and improve over time.",
              "Second, there is no agreement on the definition of the safety of AVs.",
              "While some people think that AVs must be allowed once they provide a higher safety level than human driving, others will not trust machines and will not accept the idea of putting their lives in the hands of machines [25].",
              "There are many examples of AVs\u2019 failures (next section discuss AVs accidents in details), but one of the most famous AV failures occurred in 2018 in the US when one of Uber (Volvo) AVs detected a passenger crossing the road and the vehicle chose not to make an action and continued driving until it hit the pedestrian.",
              "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that the vehicle detected the pedestrian six seconds before the accident but did not brake until 1.",
              "3 s before hitting the fatal accident [26].",
              "Later in 2018, the CEO of Waymo declared that he does not believe that AVs will be able to drive autonomously and in many conditions, it will require some human interaction [27, 28].",
              "Research on the safety of AVs started at the University of Illinois more than two decades ago.",
              "In 2020, they reported that safety of AVs is a sophisticated process because of the complexity of the system that is equipped with more than 50 processors and required to run million lines of codes to make instantaneous decisions.",
              "Additionally, the variety of conditions and situations make it hard or almost impossible to train AVs in all these conditions.",
              "When the team analyzed AVs\u2019 data in 2020, results showed that AVs are much more likely to be involved in accidents than human drivers.",
              "This study defined the AV accident event as the event when the technology fails to appropriately handle the situations, disengage the technology, and ask the human driver to take over.",
              "This situation is considered a system failure and might lead to an accident.",
              "Thus, it is considered as an accident [29].",

              "this approach is usually used for faults that cannot be removed.",
              "Fault tolerance: this approach denotes the ability of the system to avoid failure with the presence of faults.",
              "While fault preventions and fault removal focus on the avoidance or removal of faults, fault forecasting and fault tolerance deal with focus on avoiding the system failure with the existence of faults to avoid unplanned behaviors [131].",
              "In complex systems, it is not possible to achieve a fault-free system, so the fault forecasting or fault tolerance approaches are the preferred approaches.",
              "For AVs, the fault tolerance approach is the most common approach followed [129].",
              "The most common methods used for sensor fault detection are the analytical methods or the model-based models that require mathematical modeling of the system, inputs, and outputs in order to produce the detected features.",
              "Theses feature, then, are compared with the variables of the system to estimate the residual values.",
              "The residual is compared with the nominal values to detect faults and their locations.",
              "Mathematical models are very popular for fault tolerant control systems because their parameters can usually be obtained.",
              "However, in complex tasks, it is hard to develop a good and representative mathematical model, and this might not be possible.",
              "In those complex cases, other techniques such as artificial neural networks are used for fault detection and diagnosis [132].",
              "In the last few years, researchers focused on implementing fault tolerant modules for AVs in many areas such as the vehicle navigation sensors.",
              "Generally, the architectures developed for the safe navigation of AVs can be divided into two categories centralized architectures and federated architectures.",
              "Centralized architectures employ one global filter to process the measurements of all the local sensors.",
              "This architecture can detect hard sensor failures through the detection of residuals.",
              "However, the single centralized filter architecture is not powerful enough to detect soft sensor failures.",
              "On the other hand, federated architectures consist of a group of filters that work in parallel and a master filter.",
              "This architecture isolates the data from faulty sensors before integrating it into the system as the local filters fuse the data independently from a specific sensor with the common reference sensor information.",
              "Then, the information is fused in the master filter to generate the best estimations [133, 134].",
              "After identifying the error, two methods are used for the fault recovery: direct redundancy or analytical redundancy.",
              "In the direct redundancy, an additional module is employed to replace the faulty one.",
              "However, the analytical redundancy implies to utilize the working modules to complete the tasks which failed [135].",

              "Unfortunately, this approach might not be convenient at all.",

              "An AV should not collide with any other object in the environment unless avoiding such a collision does not conflict with the first and second laws.",
              "The deontological approach can provide guidance in many scenarios, however, it cannot be considered as a complete ethical system because of the difficulty involved in the articulation of complex human ethics [148].",
              "Additionally, this approach cannot address the problem related to the human factors in edge scenarios shown in a social dilemma, such as: would it matter if the pedestrian was child or was a pregnant woman [164]?",
              "The other rational approach is called the consequentialism approach that analyzes the expected utility and evaluates a set of actions that maximizes the overall benefit.",
              "This approach has the potential to formulae the ethical decision making as an optimization problem [165] that maximizes the overall utility.",
              "For AVs, the utility can be defined as damage cost.",

              "Additionally, this approach will create new issues.",
              "For example, if the vehicle chooses between hitting a cyclist with a helmet and another one without a helmet, the vehicle will choose to hit the one with the helmet.",

              "However, the AI approach has its own shortcomings.",
              "First, the behavior learned by the AI approach cannot maximize overall safety on road due to the self-preservation instincts from a human.",
              "For instance, a human driver may intuitively decide to push another vehicle into an accident to avoid self-collision.",
              "Thus, the AI system should be designed carefully to capture ideal behaviors.",
              "The second shortcoming of the AI approach is the traceability [169].",

              "Even worse, it could learn behaviors that are completely undesirable if trained with a limited set of data.",
              "As shown above, both the rational and AI approaches have their own shortcomings.",
              "Thus, a hybrid approach might represent a better solution.",
              "This hybrid approach adopts the machine learning method to study the human responses or actions on the basis of a wide range of real-world and hypothetical accident scenarios to formulate the ethical rules, meanwhile, the rules from the rational approach play the role of behavioral boundaries.",
              "This hybrid approach requires sophisticated software that does not exist yet, however, the neural network is likely a good candidate, which would be trained based on the data from recordings and simulations of crashes and near-crashes within a diverse set of training scenarios to promise the computer cannot learn an unintended ethical rule.",
              "To ensure reasonable decisions made by the vehicle, boundaries should be provided by rational approaches.",
              "To sum up, in this hybrid approach, the rule system from the rational approach remains in place as boundary requirements, and the AI method focuses on situations not covered by the rational ones [163].",

              "For example, the Vienna convention (1968) that was agreed by 74 countries states that drivers are always responsible for controlling the vehicle [30].",
              "Therefore, the key question is: can AVs drive?",
              "One of the proposed solutions is to define the AV software as the driver.",
              "However, this raises new concerns about liability, especially in complex situations [179, 180].",
              "One answer might be programming AVs with different ethical theories and let owners determine the vehicle's ethical values.",
              "In this approach, liability will be similar to liability nowadays and drivers will be liable in case of collision [178].",
              "The software of AVs must be able to mimic human decisions, but some guidelines must be programmed to be ethical.",
              "As a result, the use of a black box might be mandatory to support the legal decisions.",

              "Moreover, there is a group of questions that need to be addressed about AVs in the administrative law such as: Can AVs operate on all roads or specific roads with separated lanes?",
              "Shall AVs follow the same traffic rules as traditional vehicles?",
              "[181].",
              "Civil liability: According to the general liability laws, AV\u2019s occupant will not be responsible for the damage as he or she is not controlling the car similar to a bus passenger who is not liable in the case of collision.",

              "AI training involves millions of connections by means of training phase, which makes the process of tracking the decision at a specific moment a hard process and almost impossible [178].",
              "In general, there might be two scenarios [182].",
              "The first scenario is based on the driver liability and this approach is expected at the initial stage when both human drivers and AVs share the roads.",
              "In this scenario, the driver will be liable in case the vehicle provided him with sufficient warnings to take manual control and take an action to avoid collisions and with sufficient time to control.",

              "nl/en/articles/the-economic-and-social-impacts-of-fully-autonomous-vehicles/ While many people see autonomous vehicles as the solution to reduce congestion, traffic accidents and greenhouse gas emissions, others believe this technology will result in a loss of jobs in many sectors.",
              "Taking a holistic view on this technology, by taking both positive and negative impacts into account and converting them into societal costs and benefits, can result in new insights.",
              "This article provides a snapshot of these potential societal costs which can be used by governments, car manufacturers and other stakeholders as a starting point for discussing how to ensure this technology will optimally benefit all of us.",
              "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to significantly impact society by providing driverless mobility to a broad range of people, from door to door.",
              "Not only those who are currently able to drive a vehicle, but also those who don\u2019t due to physical, psychological or other conditions will be affected by this new technology.",
              "Furthermore, AVs can improve access to mobility to lower- and middle-income classes, as the costs of transportation will be reduced: some experts estimate that this form of transportation will become almost 50% cheaper compared to current costs, meaning that this form of transportation might be cheaper than public transport.",
              "This new technology can bring many benefits to society, as experts estimate that AVs can drastically reduce travel time due to reduced traffic jams. On top of this, people within the AV who do not drive can be productive during their journey, while being in a much safer vehicle.",
              "However, as with all technologies, there are plenty of downsides.",
              "While millions of jobs might be transformed, many will also be lost as demand for human drivers in the transportation sector may disappear.",
              "While some jobs such as taxi drivers might disappear completely in the long run, other jobs such as those of police officers might change as they will not be needed anymore for giving speeding and parking tickets.",
              "Autonomous vehicles also have secondary effects.",
              "As AVs are expected to be safer than vehicles with human drivers, the chance of getting an accident will be reduced.",
              "This reduction in car accidents will impact transport-related sectors such as insurance industries and car repair centers, again impacting millions of jobs.",
              "For instance, Tesla is already offering insurance services to its customers as it expects it can offer this at a much cheaper rate than current insurance providers due to the constantly improving over-the-air updates, which make its vehicles safer due to autonomous functions.",
              "Furthermore, public transport might become redundant, as AVs will become cheaper than public transport, safer in terms of less accidents, and also could be more comfortable in terms of privacy and hygiene.",
              "In fact, during a global pandemic where public transport is hardly used anymore, autonomous vehicles might even be a solution to sustain economic activity while reducing the chance to spread a virus.",
              "Along with the broader movement of the sharing economy, AVs have the potential to be a catalyst of seeing mobility not only as a product (owning a vehicle) but as a service or a combination of these two.",
              "The threshold for owners of AVs to rent their vehicle to others will be lowered significantly, as people know who is driving it.",
              "As a result, everyone who owns an AV can start their own taxi service or car rental organization: AirBnB for vehicles.",
              "As vehicle production companies are developing this technology, and the public is slowly embracing the concept of autonomous driving, it is important for many stakeholders \u2013 including policymakers and mobility-related industries \u2013 to understand how AVs might impact society and their business.",
              "This article explores how autonomous vehicles have the potential to create and destroy value for society, the economy and the environment both in the United States and in the Netherlands.",
              "This article, as stated in the title, addresses social and economic impacts brought on by autonomous vehicles.",
              "It truly helps the designers see long term problems that might be brought on by autonomous vehicles, such as the loss of driver type jobs as new technologies move in.",
              "It can be difficult to make these connections, and I feel that this article does a really good job of summarizing points that may have been more difficult to understand without a very broad context.",
              "Overall, it will be an aid in the design process because it is yet another article that prioritizes naming stakeholders and the issues that they could wind up dealing with as this transition to vehicle autonomy begins.",
