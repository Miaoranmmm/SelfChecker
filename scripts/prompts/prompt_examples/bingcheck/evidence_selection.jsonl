{"claim": "The discovery of the new moon around Jupiter was made by Kai Ly, a 27-year-old software engineer from San Francisco.", "passage": "The amateur astronomer who last year recovered four lost Jovian moons has become the first amateur to discover a previously unknown moon.\nKai Ly reported the discovery to the Minor Planet Mailing List on June 30th and has submitted it for publication as a Minor Planet Electronic Circular.\nLy's quest was a spin-off of their earlier identification of pre-recovery images of recently discovered Jovian moons including Valetudo, Ersa, and Pandia while examining data taken with the 3.\n6-meter Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT).\nDavid Jewitt and Scott Sheppard (both then at University of Hawai‘i) had led a group that used these images to discover 23 new moons, which they announced in 2003.", "analysis": "The claim is partially supported by 'Kai Ly reported the discovery to the Minor Planet Mailing List on June 30th and has submitted it for publication as a Minor Planet Electronic Circular.' because this sentence provides information about Kai Ly's report of the moon discovery and their submission for publication, confirming that Kai Ly made the discovery, but it does not mention the occupation of Kai Ly."}
{"claim": "Kai Ly used data from a NASA survey called JunoCam for the discovery.", "passage": "Using old telescope images, Ly was able spot the unnamed satellite orbiting Jupiter, which is nearly 385 million miles from Earth.\nThe distant planet has at least 79 moons—now 80—some so small and indistinct they can only be detected by a large telescope one month of the year.\n(Ly posted their data visuals in Imgur.)\nTo locate this satellite, Ly scoured images taken by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in 2003, reports Jeff Hecht of Sky & Telescope.\nThis dataset was the same one they used to find the four “lost” moons last year.\nThe barely discernable satellites disappeared from view until Ly was able replot their trajectories and identify them on the images.", "analysis": "There is no evidence either supporting or refuting the claim because the passage mainly focuses on Kai Ly's discovery of a new moon around Jupiter, the process they followed, and their background as an amateur astronomer."}
