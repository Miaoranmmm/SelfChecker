# Self-Checker: Plug-and-Play Modules for Fact-Checking with Large Language Models

This repository is for the paper [Self-Checker: Plug-and-Play Modules for Fact-Checking with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14623)


In this paper, we introduce Self-Checker, a plug-and-play framework that harnesses LLMs for efficient and rapid fact-checking in a few-shot manner. We also present the BingCheck dataset, specifically designed for fact-checking texts generated by LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate the potential of Self-Checker in the use of LLMs for fact-checking. Compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuned models, there is still significant room for improvement, indicating that adopting LLMs could be a promising direction for future fact-checking research.
